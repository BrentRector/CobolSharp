## Summary

Decision-complete design for cross-program data + calls in COBOL.NET (COBOL→typed-native C#→Roslyn). The load-bearing problem is BY REFERENCE on typed-native fields with NO byte window. Resolution: ONE managed-reference carrier (the typed-native re-implementation of `ManagedPointer`, internally `ManagedRef<T>`) that serves BY REFERENCE args, LINKAGE items, USAGE POINTER, ADDRESS OF, BASED, ALLOCATE, and SET ADDRESS OF — honoring the owner's singular-pattern rule. Crucially the carrier does NOT box WORKING-STORAGE: an ordinary `01 WS-X PIC 9(4)` stays a native `long`; a carrier is built ONLY at a call site as `ManagedRef<long>.OverField(()=>WS_X, v=>WS_X=v)` (an accessor over the caller's native field) so DISPLAY/MOVE/arithmetic keep zero indirection. The calling convention has two layers: a uniform opaque ABI (`ICobolProgram.Call(CobolArgs)`, the typed analog of the rejected `Entry(ManagedPointer[])`) for dynamic/cross-assembly CALL, and a typed fast path (direct `R=_SUB.Run(...)`) for same-assembly, statically-resolvable, PIC-conforming calls. Each program becomes its own (instantiable, not static) C# class; nested programs are nested classes; recursion/functions/methods get a per-activation instance, plain programs a cached singleton for last-used persistence. RETURNING maps to the C# method return value (idiomatic). The only sanctioned transient-byte boundary is category-mismatch BY REFERENCE (PIC X(4) arg viewed as PIC 9(4)); same-category — the common case — is always fully typed. Pointers are always-typed (never byte-gated).

## Decisions

### D1. ONE managed-reference carrier `ManagedRef<T>` (the typed-native re-implementation of `ManagedPointer`) serves BY REFERENCE args, LINKAGE items, USAGE POINTER, ADDRESS OF, BASED, ALLOCATE/FREE, SET ADDRESS OF — with two construction modes (accessor-over-native-field | standalone cell) plus a Null state.

**Rationale.** Owner singular-pattern + managed-pointer rules mandate exactly ONE carrier for 'a managed reference to a storage location'; BY REFERENCE and pointers are the same concept. Accessor-over-field means WORKING-STORAGE stays native (no boxing), so only genuine aliases (LINKAGE / ALLOCATE) carry indirection — preserving the native-field North Star.

**Rejected alternatives.** (a) `CobolRef<T>` as a NEW parallel reference type — rejected: violates singular-pattern (owner would correct it). (b) Make every aliasable item itself a `CobolRef<T>` heap cell — rejected: re-introduces a uniform indirection layer over all storage (the byte-State sin in new clothes; reads through .Value on a heap object). (c) Legacy `ManagedPointer(byte[],offset,length)` — rejected: that IS the abandoned byte substrate; a managed ref can't serialize to stable bytes anyway. (d) C# `ref` parameters everywhere — rejected: `ref` can't be stored in a field (LINKAGE item must persist for the activation), can't be re-pointed by SET ADDRESS OF, and can't cross the opaque dynamic-CALL ABI.

### D2. Two-layer calling convention: a uniform opaque ABI (`interface ICobolProgram { int Call(CobolArgs args); void Cancel(); }`, `CobolArgs` = ordered (PassMode, caller PicMeta, carrier)) for dynamic + cross-assembly CALL; a typed fast path (direct typed method `R=_SUB.Run(carrier...)`) for same-assembly, statically-resolvable, conforming calls.

**Rationale.** The tightest constraint is `CALL identifier` and CALL to a separate `<name>.dll`: the caller can't see the callee's LINKAGE, forcing a uniform entry signature + uniform carrier array (the typed analog of the rejected `Entry(ManagedPointer[])`). Designing the opaque ABI first means the typed fast path is a pure optimization, not a retrofit.

**Rejected alternatives.** Typed ref-param signatures only — rejected: dynamic CALL and cross-assembly resolution would retrofit badly (the callee signature is unknown at the call site). Trailing-scratch-buffer RETURNING (legacy `InvokeNumericFunction`) — rejected: that is the byte ABI; RETURNING → idiomatic C# method return value instead.

### D3. Each program → its own instantiable (non-static) C# class; nested/contained programs → nested classes; the run unit compiles to one assembly with the first program as entry.

**Rationale.** Recursion, functions, and methods need a per-activation instance (§14.6.2.3); a static class cannot recurse. Plain non-recursive programs use a cached singleton instance to realize last-used persistence. Nested classes mirror COBOL nested-program scope (outer GLOBAL/COMMON visible, outer LOCAL-STORAGE not).

**Rejected alternatives.** Today's single `internal static class Program` bound to the first program unit — rejected: cannot host multiple/nested programs and cannot recurse. One assembly per program by default — deferred to an owner flag (separately-compiled `.dll` is supported via the opaque ABI but loses the typed fast path).

**The container's CONFIGURATION SECTION and OPTIONS apply to its containees (§12.3.4 GR1 / §11.9.4 GR1; PB60 / AR-15.67.3-5, 2026-08-17).** A contained program shall not have a configuration section of its own (§12.3.3 SR1 — COBOLNET1643), so it inherits the container's WHOLE configuration-derived state — SPECIAL-NAMES (DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA, CURRENCY SIGN, CLASS names, ALPHABETs, switch mnemonics/conditions), the OBJECT-COMPUTER PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE, SOURCE-COMPUTER DEBUGGING MODE, and the REPOSITORY specifiers — through the ONE `DataBinder.InheritConfiguration(container)`, called by `BinderDriver.BindUnitData` BEFORE the containee binds (its first literal and PICTURE already see the switches; units bind container-first, so one level carries the ancestry). OPTIONS inherit with clause-by-clause override: `OptionsBinder.Bind(program, edition, baseline)` starts from the container's model. Before this, only the REPOSITORY sets were inherited (after Bind), and a contained program under DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA parsed `NUMVAL("123,45")` as 0 and `NUMVAL("123.45")` as 123.45 — the exact inversion of §15.67.3 r5, undiagnosed. Pinned by `pb60_nested_configuration_inheritance` (2023: SPECIAL-NAMES + OPTIONS inheritance and an inner OPTIONS override) and `nested_special_names_inheritance` (85: the edition-invariant SPECIAL-NAMES half); the negative `config-section-in-contained-program` carries SR1.

### D4. State→storage matrix (the §13.5.4/§13.6.4/§14.6.2.3 storage-class × unit-kind model): plain program → WS as instance fields on a cached singleton (static data realized by instance caching — the unit can never be concurrently active, §8.6.6, so one cached instance IS the one last-used copy); INITIAL → fresh instance per activation (WS is INITIAL data, §13.5.4 GR2 — instance fields re-initialize by construction); RECURSIVE (and every function/method, §8.6.6) → WS as STATIC C# fields (ONE per-class copy — §13.5.4 GR1 static data, last-used across ALL concurrent/successive activations per §14.6.2.3.3; INDEXED BY cells and Tier-B backings ride the same `StaticRootFields`/`StaticIndexCells` channel as method WS — one mechanism, two producers) over a fresh instance per activation that carries everything per-activation; LOCAL-STORAGE (program/function-level, bound via the ONE `BindEntries(EntrySection.LocalStorage)` path) → instance fields = automatic data (§13.6.4 GR1), in initial state EVERY activation — realized by the fresh instance for INITIAL/RECURSIVE units and by an emitted `Call`-entry re-initialization (the same composed `ValueInitializer` initializers) for cached-singleton units; EXTERNAL → one run-unit holder per externalized name on the `ExternalStore` (not reset by CANCEL, §14.9.5 GR8; never a per-class static); GLOBAL → field on the outer class instance, reached by nested classes through `__outer` ref-bridges; LINKAGE → carrier-bound (never initialized); CANCEL → next CALL finds initial state (§14.9.5 GR3): the instance drops AND — for a RECURSIVE unit — the registered `__ResetStatics` reassigns every static WS field/index cell to its declaration initializer (also invoked at run-unit registration = the §14.6.2.3.2 case-1 trigger, and via an INITIAL container's implicit cancel cascade = case 2).

**Rationale.** Directly implements ISO §13.5.4 (WS = static/initial data), §13.6.4 (LS = automatic data), §14.6.2.3 (initial/last-used: automatic+initial data → initial state every activation; static data → initial only on the three §14.6.2.3.2 triggers; static+external are the ONLY last-used data), §8.6.6 (COMMON/INITIAL/RECURSIVE; functions always recursive), §8.6.7 (EXTERNAL sharing), §14.9.5 (CANCEL). A recursive unit's WS MUST NOT live on the per-activation instance — that would re-initialize it per activation, violating §14.6.2.3.3.

**Rejected alternatives.** All-static fields (legacy) — rejected: cannot represent RECURSIVE per-activation LOCAL-STORAGE/formal copies or INITIAL re-init cleanly. WS-on-the-fresh-instance for RECURSIVE units — rejected: miscompiles shared last-used WS into per-activation initial state (the pre-P10 defect, DEVLOG 864). A per-program ExecutionContext object threading byte StorageBlocks (legacy) — rejected: byte substrate.

**Named stages (honest subset, loud):** a RECURSIVE program that directly CONTAINS programs and declares WS **or a FILE SECTION** stages 0899 `recursive-contained-working-storage` (a containee's GLOBAL `__outer` ref-bridge aliases container-INSTANCE fields, which cannot reach class statics — and an FD may be GLOBAL, §13.18.27; the FILE SECTION arm joined with kb/Work PB168); BASED / ADDRESS-OF-taken records in a RECURSIVE unit's WS stage 0899 `recursive-working-storage-pointer-backed` (their `StorageCell`/address-pointer storage is per-instance). ~~Recorded residue: per-activation file connectors~~ — **CLOSED (kb/Work PB168):** a childless RECURSIVE unit's internal file connectors AND FD record areas are unit-scoped last-used state (§8.6.4 — one copy per run unit; §14.6.2.3.2 action 3 re-initializes them only on the static initial-state cases 1–3): the `__filesRegistered` guard emits STATIC (`DataBinder.UnitStaticFiles`), `__ResetStatics` clears it on exactly those cases, FILE SECTION records route through `RouteStaticUnitStorage`'s per-root routine like WS, report-engine construction rides its own per-INSTANCE `__reportsConstructed` guard, and NOTHING per-activation is installed on the shared connector at all: the LINAGE operand values and the ASSIGN … USING association are arguments of the OPEN/WRITE statements that read them (kb/Work PB673 — §13.18.34 GR6 b) and §12.4.5.3 GR3 b) name the runtime element that EXECUTES the statement, and an unguarded install answers with the last activation to have run its prologue, which after an inner activation RETURNS is dead storage).

### D5. The single sanctioned transient-byte boundary is confined to category-mismatch BY REFERENCE (e.g. a PIC X(4) argument viewed by the callee as PIC 9(4)) and to a data-pointer rebasing a differently-typed BASED item; same-category aliasing is always fully typed.

**Rationale.** `ManagedRef<string>` and `ManagedRef<long>` cannot alias the same typed location, but ISO BY REFERENCE = 'same storage area reinterpreted'. The architecture already permits a transient (never-persisted) byte image at unavoidable boundaries; confining it to category mismatch keeps the overwhelmingly common same-category case fully native.

**Rejected alternatives.** A universal byte window under all BY REFERENCE (legacy) — rejected: byte substrate for the common case. Forbidding category mismatch outright — rejected: it is legal COBOL exercised by NIST.

### D6. The program-prototype registry is ONE per-unit name→`ProgramPrototype` table, built the way the user-function table is built, and it feeds ONE `CalleeSignature` shared with `AS NESTED` (kb/Work PB237).

`REPOSITORY. PROGRAM program-prototype-name-1 [AS literal-3].` (§12.3.8.2's program-specifier) is the ONE surface that declares a program-prototype-name, and three constructs take that name as their subject: CALL Format 2's `AS` arm (§14.9.4.3 SR16), CALL Format 2's bare operand (§14.9.4.4 GR3 b) third bullet), and CANCEL's third brace alternative (§14.9.5.3 SR3 / §14.9.5.4 GR1 c)).

**The pipeline, in three stages, each in the place its inputs are.**

1. **Syntax → `DataBinder.ProgramSpecifiers`** (`BindProgramSpecifier`): one entry per written specifier, keyed by prototype name, carrying the externalized name (literal-3, else the name — §12.3.8.4 GR10 NOTE 1). §12.3.8.3 SR1 (repeated specifications shall be identical) and SR2 (literal-3's class) are checked here, where the written text is. The set inherits into contained units through `InheritConfiguration`, beside its REPOSITORY siblings — §12.3.8.4 GR10 scopes the name to "the containing environment division".
2. **Resolution → `BinderDriver.ProgramPrototypesOf(unit, …)`**, run in the same group pass that builds the user-function table, because both need every unit's DATA bound. `BuildProgramDefinitionTable` is the group's outermost, non-function, non-prototype program definitions keyed by EXTERNALIZED name (`BoundUnit.ExternalizedName` — see D7) — the search space of §12.3.8.4 GR10 a). A specifier whose externalized name hits it resolves WITH a signature; one that misses resolves WITHOUT one, which is GR10 c): "the details are taken from the external repository", and **this implementation's external repository is the run unit's program registry**, consulted at activation (§14.9.4.4 GR3 b), EC-PROGRAM-NOT-FOUND on a miss). GR10 b) — an in-group program PROTOTYPE DEFINITION — needs §11.10.2 Format 2's `PROGRAM-ID … IS PROTOTYPE` source-unit kind, which this compiler does not yet accept; it slots between a) and c) when it lands. §8.4.6.8's second spelling (a containing program definition's program-name, no specifier needed) registers in the same table, which is also how §12.3.8.3 SR15's "this specifier is ignored" is realized — the definition overwrites the specifier's entry.
3. **Reference → `CallBinder`**, through the ONE `ResolvePrototype` lookup that both verbs call, and the ONE `BarePrototypeWord` shape test that decides whether an identifier-shaped operand may be read as a prototype name at all.

**Why `CalleeSignature` is not named for `AS NESTED` any more.** §14.9.4.3 SR25 makes §14.8.2 and §14.8.3 apply to *a Format-2 CALL*, not to AS NESTED specifically. `BindCall`'s argument-count, SR19/SR21 mode-agreement, SR24 OPTIONAL-correspondence, §14.8.2 description-conformance and §14.8.3 returning-conformance checks all read one `callee` / `calleeFormals` pair, so wiring the prototype producer delivered the whole regime at once. The single deliberate exception is the §14.8.2.3.2 restricted-data-pointer check, which stays `asNested`-only: `StrongTypeModel`'s equivalence is name-based within a source element and defers cross-program EXTERNAL equivalence, and a prototype's GR10 a) definition is a separate outermost element.

**Discrimination order, and why.** `CALL X` and `CANCEL X` are spelled identically whether X is identifier-1 or program-prototype-name-1 (the §14.9.4.2 Format 2 bracket encloses the target brace *and* the word `AS`, so it may be omitted whole — PDF page 619). Both binders therefore **probe the data reference first** — `Refs.Probe`, which reports nothing on a miss — and read the word as a prototype only when it is not a data item. That ordering is what makes the feature strictly additive: no program that binds today changes meaning.

**Rejected alternatives.** A second signature record for prototypes — rejected: it would have duplicated seven §14.8.2/§14.8.3 checks and let the two copies drift (the two-arm-dispatch defect shape). Rejecting a prototype whose program is not in the compilation group — rejected: GR10 c) admits exactly that, and it is the ordinary separately-compiled callee.

### D7. A unit carries TWO names, not one: the DECLARED `Name` and the `ExternalizedName` the `AS` phrase gives it. A reference by a LITERAL resolves the externalized one; a reference by a user-defined WORD resolves the declared one (kb/Work PB303).

ISO §8.3.2.2 2) is the whole rule: *"For any externalized user-defined words for which the AS phrase is specified, the content of the literal specified in that AS phrase is a name that is externalized to the operating environment. The implementor defines the formation and mapping rules of these names."* §11.10.4 GR1 keeps the pair distinct in so many words — *"Program-name-1 names the program declared by this program definition. Literal-1, if specified, is the name of the program that is externalized to the operating environment"* — and §11.5.4 GR1, §11.3.4 GR1, §11.6.4 GR1 and §11.7.4 GR1 b) repeat it for FUNCTION-ID, CLASS-ID, INTERFACE-ID and METHOD-ID.

**The dispatch is on the FORM of the reference, and §8.3.2.2 states it NORMATIVELY** — it is not inferred from the individual verbs. *"Externalized names shall be referenced in a source element only: 1) in the AS phrase in a repository paragraph entry, 2) in the AS phrase in an EXTERNAL clause, 3) as program-name in a CALL statement, 4) as program-name in a CANCEL statement, 5) as program-name in a program-address-identifier, 6) as method-name in an INVOKE statement or inline method invocation. All other references to names for which externalization is permitted shall be specified using the user-defined words, as opposed to the externalized names."* Six sites take the externalized name and nothing else does, which is exactly the table below; each verb's own general rule (§14.9.4.4 GR3 b), §14.9.23.4 GR2 a)) then routes through §8.3.2.2 for the mapping:

| Reference | Rule | Resolves against |
|---|---|---|
| `CALL` / `CANCEL` literal-1 or identifier-1 | §14.9.4.4 GR3 b) — "the program-name of the program being called, **as described in 8.3.2.2**" | `ExternalizedName` |
| the program-address-identifier operand — ISO `ADDRESS OF PROGRAM { identifier-1 \| literal-1 \| program-prototype-name-1 }` (§8.4.3.13.2) and the Micro Focus / IBM `TO ENTRY` spelling alike | §8.4.3.13.4 GR1/GR2 — "the outermost program identified by the **externalized** program-name" | `ExternalizedName` |
| the EXTERNAL clause's `AS literal-1` | §13.18.22.4 GR5 — "Literal-1, if specified, is the name of the file connector or record that is **externalized to the operating environment**" | the run-unit `ExternalStore` cell key (`DataItem.ExternalizedAs` / `FileModel.ExternalName`) |
| §12.3.8.4 GR10 a) search of the compilation group | "the externalized name of a program definition" | `ExternalizedName` |
| `INVOKE` literal-1 or identifier-2 | §14.9.23.4 GR2 a) — the same formula; and §14.9.23.2 gives INVOKE **no word form at all** | the method roster key = `ExternalizedName` |
| `END PROGRAM` / `END FUNCTION` / `END CLASS` / `END METHOD` | §10.7.3 SR2 — "identical to the program-name declared in a preceding PROGRAM-ID paragraph" | `Name` |
| `CALL ... AS NESTED` literal-1 | §14.9.4.3 SR15 — "the same as the **program-name** specified in a PROGRAM-ID paragraph" | `Name` (and §11.10.3 SR2 forbids AS on a containee, so the two coincide there) |
| `FUNCTION user-function-name` | §8.4.6.6 / §8.4.6.7 scope the WORD | `Name` |
| an object-class-name / interface-name | §8.4.6.4 scopes the WORD | `Name` |
| `FUNCTION MODULE-NAME` | §15.65.4 r4 is implementor-defined; CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-135 chooses the program-id form | `Name` |

**AND THE SAME CLAUSE MAKES EACH OF THOSE NAMES NAME ONE THING (kb/Work PB660).** §8.3.2.2 does not only say
WHICH name a reference resolves; it says a name resolves to ONE definition: *“Within a run unit, all instances
of a given name that is externalized to the operating environment shall identify the same kind of entity or
item. Except for method-names and property-names, when two or more source elements identify something with the
same externalized name, they refer to the same instance.”* Two distinct definitions cannot be one instance, so a
compilation group that defines one externalized name twice is nonconforming and the compiler — which sees both
— reports it. `BinderDriver.CheckDefinitionNameUniqueness` is the ONE place that rule lives, in the two scopes
the standard gives it:

| scope | population | rule | code |
|---|---|---|---|
| the whole compilation group | §8.3.2.2's OWN list item 1, as far as this compiler models it — OUTERMOST program definitions, FUNCTION definitions, CLASS definitions and INTERFACE definitions, by `ExternalizedName` | §8.3.2.2 — SAME-kind pairs by its “refer to the same instance” sentence, CROSS-kind pairs by its “same kind of entity or item” sentence | COBOLNET2213 |
| ONE outermost program | its containment subtree, by declared `Name` | §8.4.6.3 — *“The names assigned to programs that are contained directly or indirectly within the same outermost program shall be unique within that outermost program”* | COBOLNET2214 |
| the compilation group | object-class / interface definitions, by `Name` | §8.4.6.4 — its own explicit uniqueness sentences | COBOLNET0820 / COBOLNET0840 |
| the compilation group | FUNCTION definitions, by declared WORD | §8.4.6.7 — a REPOSITORY `FUNCTION word` entry names the user-function-NAME, so two definitions sharing a word are ambiguous even under different `AS` literals | COBOLNET1508 |

All four definition kinds are ONE namespace in the first row, not four, because §8.3.2.2's list item 1
externalizes all of them — which is why the function-only duplicate check that used to sit in
`BuildUserFunctionTable` (and cited §8.4.6.6, the scope of function-prototype-NAMES, a real clause answering
a different question) is gone, and why a CLASS-ID sharing a PROGRAM-ID's externalized name used to compile
clean: **every namespace policed only itself, so nothing ever compared a definition of one kind against a
definition of another.** The two rows below keep exactly what their own clauses own — §8.4.6.7's WORD
ambiguity for functions, and §8.4.6.4's class/interface word uniqueness, which row 1 deliberately does not
restate (a class/class or class/interface pair sharing a WORD is skipped there, so one fault draws one
diagnostic; a pair whose words differ and whose `AS` literals coincide is §8.3.2.2's alone and row 1 has
it).

⚠ **DETERMINATION — the comparison is CASE-INSENSITIVE**, the same one `ProgramTable.NameEquals` resolves a CALL
with. §8.3.2.2 leaves the mapping to the implementor (*“The implementor defines the formation and mapping rules
of these names”*); what is not optional is that the bind-time check and the run-unit resolver agree, or source
this check passes still resolves to the wrong definition. PROTOTYPE units contribute nothing here: §10.6.2
SR2 legislates FOR the pair — *“If a compilation group contains both a program definition and a program prototype
definition with the same externalized name, the signatures of these two compilation units shall be the same”* —
and SR3 is its function twin. The complement is pinned as hard as the
refusals (`DefinitionNameUniquenessTests`): two different containers may EACH contain a program of one name,
and two outermost programs may share the declared word under different `AS` literals.

**Where the pair lives.** `BoundUnit.Name` / `BoundUnit.ExternalizedName` for programs and functions; `OoClassSymbol` / `OoInterfaceSymbol` / `OoMethodSymbol.ExternalizedName` for the OO trio; `DataItem.ExternalizedAs` and `FileModel.ExternalName` for §8.3.2.2's site 2), the EXTERNAL clause — whose default is §13.18.22.4 GR5's second sentence (the subject's own data-name or file-name) and is applied at the ONE cell-keying site, `DataBinder.CallMakeExternal` (kb/Work PB511). Each defaults to the declared word, so a source unit with no AS phrase is bit-for-bit what it was. The run-unit registry carries both (`ProgramTable.Node.Name` for MODULE-NAME, `Node.CallName` for resolution) and `ProgramRegistry.Register` takes its `externalizedName` argument only when they differ, keeping every AS-less unit emitted registration line byte-identical.

**Why `CsName` is deliberately NOT derived from the externalized name.** For a class the emitted C# type name is a wire contract with `PicInfo.ClrType`, which maps a declared object-class-name to a C# type with no access to the class table; deriving it from the AS literal would break that mapping. The method side has no such constraint, which is why the METHOD roster IS keyed on the externalized name — and that key also realizes §11.7.3 SR9 (*"if method-name-1 **or literal-1** is the same as a method-name inherited or implemented"*) without a second lookup path.

**Rejected alternative: one field.** That is what the tree had, and it was wrong in both directions. `MakeUnit` overwrote `name` with the AS literal, so §10.7.3 SR2 END PROGRAM match and the §15.65.4 r4 MODULE-NAME determination would both have broken the moment the phrase parsed — which it could not, because the phrase had no grammar surface at all (kb/Work PB303: rejected at 2002+ with COBOLNET0901 because `AS` fell through the PROGRAM-ID attribute list as a user-defined word, and ACCEPTED at 85, the one edition whose PROGRAM-ID paragraph has no AS phrase).

### D8. The FUNCTION-POINTER carrier is the PROGRAM-POINTER carrier's TWIN and deliberately a SEPARATE type; the `TO {function|program}-prototype-name-1` restriction is ONE field and its same-signature rule ONE test (kb/Work PB452 + PB817).

**The carriers.** `CobolNet.Runtime.FunctionPointer(string? Name)` is shape-for-shape `ProgramPointer`: a readonly record struct over the EXTERNALIZED function-name, which ISO §8.4.3.12.4 GR2 makes the address of a COBOL function outright (*“For a COBOL function, the address is that of the function identified by the externalized function-name in its FUNCTION-ID paragraph”*), resolved through the ONE run-unit `ProgramTable` (`FunctionAddressOf`, the `EntryOf` twin, differing only in the `Node.IsFunction` discriminator §8.4.6.3's first paragraph requires in both directions). ⛔ **Two structs, not one.** §8.4.3.10.4 gives each category its own predefined NULL and §14.9.39.3 SR20/SR21 forbid mixing the two categories in one SET, so a shared struct would make a program-pointer and a function-pointer assignment-compatible in the GENERATED C# — the one place the binder's category screens cannot reach. Alignment / size / representation / allowable languages are published as `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` §7 row **DOC-A.1-210** (§13.18.60.4 GR26 requires it); GR15's “effect of SET on the function” is row **DOC-A.1-174** and the determination is NONE.

**The restriction is one field.** `PicInfo.RestrictedPrototypeName` carries the `TO` operand for BOTH prototype carriers — §13.18.60.4 GR25 (program) and GR26 (function) — because the two general rules are one rule twice and so are their consumers, §14.9.39.3 SR20 and SR22: *“the {function|program}-prototypes associated with identifier-N and identifier-M shall have the same signature”*. The CATEGORY says which namespace resolves the name (§8.4.6.6 vs §8.4.6.8 — themselves the same sentence twice, and screened by one block in `DataBinder`); the RULE over it is `PrototypeSignatures.Same`, which compares the two `CalleeSignature`s position by position through `OoConformance.DescriptionMismatch`, the compiler's ONE description-equality check. It is DISTINCT from `RestrictedTypeName` (§13.18.60.4 GR23) because that one names a TYPE, not a prototype. §13.18.60.3 **SR18 and SR19** — the TYPEDEF requirement — are likewise one screen; there is NO function twin of them (measured: §13.18.60.3 stops at SR21 and carries no function-prototype-name sentence), so a level-1 `USAGE FUNCTION-POINTER TO fp` needs no TYPEDEF while `USAGE PROGRAM-POINTER TO pp` does.

**Optionality is measured, not assumed.** On the printed §13.18.60.2 general format (folio 503) POINTER's and PROGRAM-POINTER's `TO` operands are BRACKETED and FUNCTION-POINTER's is NOT — so every function-pointer is restricted to a prototype, GR26's signature invariant always has one to name, and a bare `USAGE FUNCTION-POINTER.` is COBOLNET1958. The word `TO` itself is NOT underlined in any of the three (kb/Work PB848), so it is an optional word (§5.2.3): `USAGE FUNCTION-POINTER fp-proto` restricts exactly as `… TO fp-proto` does, and `DataBinder` reads the OPERAND's presence, never the TO token's.

**The consumer — a function-identifier through the pointer (kb/Work PB847).** §8.4.3.2.2 gives the function-identifier a third name form, function-pointer-name-1 (SR4: a function-pointer data item; SR2: FUNCTION may be omitted; SR5: the parentheses are required). It binds in `IntrinsicBinder` — the FUNCTION-keyword form in `BindIntrinsicCore` after the prototype arm, the keyword-omitted `fp (args)` form in `KeywordOmittedFunction` (a function-pointer is never a table, so the '(' takes nothing from the subscript path), both through ONE `FunctionPointerNamed` test — and lowers in `UdfBinder.UdfActivate`, the SAME prototype activation a function-prototype reference takes: §8.4.3.2.4 GR1/GR4 take the result description and the activated element's characteristics from the prototype the pointer's TO phrase names, so the arguments, the §14.8.2 conformance and the result temporary are the prototype path's own. The ONE difference is the target: the hoisted `BoundCallProgram` carries the pointer operand (`IsFunction` + `IsPointerTarget`) and the emitter's ONE invocation renderer (`CallEmitter.InvocationText`, shared by the statement and per-evaluation sites) activates `ProgramRegistry.CallFunctionPointer` — the function the pointer HOLDS at run time (GR6c), resolved through the same `CallProgram` lookup with GR6b's EC-FUNCTION-NOT-FOUND, and a NULL pointer raising **EC-FUNCTION-PTR-NULL** (Fatal), queried precisely for that node in `EcBinder`. `FUNCTION fp` without parentheses is COBOLNET2234 (SR5).

**The sender.** SET Format 8's own printed figure (folio 730) is `SET { identifier-12 } … TO identifier-13` with no choice indicators — identical to Format 9 — so the PLAIN form needs no grammar rule: `SET fp1 TO fp2` parses as `setToValueStatement` and `SET fp TO NULL` as `setObjectReferenceStatement`, and `SetBinder` re-routes on the receiver's resolved category exactly as Format 9 does. What needs a rule is §8.4.3.12's **function-address-identifier**, `ADDRESS OF FUNCTION { function-prototype-name-1 | identifier-1 }` (`setFunctionAddressStatement`; `OF` is unstressed on the printed folio 141, so it is an optional word, and there is no literal-1 arm — §8.4.3.13's PROGRAM twin has one and this does not). Without it a function-pointer could never hold a non-NULL value.

**And the PROGRAM twin, which was missing for longer** (kb/Work PB549). §8.4.3.13's
**program-address-identifier** — `ADDRESS OF PROGRAM { identifier-1 | literal-1 | program-prototype-name-1 }`,
RENDERED from the printed figure (PDF p172 / folio 142: ADDRESS and PROGRAM underlined, `OF` not, so it is an
optional word on the same evidence its FUNCTION and data twins take theirs from) — is the ONLY syntax ISO gives
for putting a program's address into a program-pointer, and it was in the grammar at NO edition. The only route
in was `SET pp TO ENTRY {literal | identifier}`, the Micro Focus / IBM spelling whose words occur nowhere in
ISO/IEC 1989:2023 — which two comments in the tree nevertheless described AS §14.9.39 Format 9 with the
§8.4.3.13 sender. Both spellings now exist, `programAddressIdentifier` is its own grammar rule because
§8.4.3.13 is an IDENTIFIER format rather than a statement phrase, and both bind through ONE body: the
§14.9.39.3 SR21 receiver screen is shared (`BindProgramAddressTargets`) and both reach the same bound node, so
the vendor surface cannot drift away from the standard one. The three braced arms carry §8.4.3.13.3 SR1 / SR2 /
SR3 on COBOLNET2157, the prototype arm resolves through the EXTERNALIZED program-name §8.4.3.13.4 GR2 names, and
GR3's restricted-pointer characteristic meets a restricted receiver through the SAME `PrototypeSignatures.Same`
test SR22 and SR20 already share. Edition row: `set-program-pointer-2002`, beside `set-function-pointer-2014`.

**Two determinations on §14.9.39.4 GR14's run-time screen.**
1. GR14 says the address shall be *“the address of a function defined with the same signature as the function referenced in the definition of identifier-13”*, which cannot be read literally when identifier-13 is a function-address-identifier of the `identifier-1` form (§8.4.3.12.4 GR1 a) — that form names no prototype at all. The screen is therefore implemented against the RECEIVING item's declared function-prototype, which is §13.18.60.4 GR26's own standing invariant and is what GR14 enforces statement by statement; wherever the sender DOES carry a prototype, SR20 has already made the two identical at bind, so no conforming program can observe the difference.
2. The run-time compare is **arity-only**, because a registered unit carries `FormalCount`/`RequiredCount` and nothing finer — the same granularity as the existing compile-time COBOLNET1513 prototype-vs-definition check. The COMPILE-TIME SR20/SR22 compare is richer: it has both bound `CalleeSignature`s. When the receiver's prototype has NO compile-time signature (a §12.3.8.4 GR11 c) external-repository prototype) the screen is not emitted at all rather than run against a guessed arity — GR4's not-found screen still runs, because locating a function needs no signature.

**The two EC raises ride opposite rules and are written that way.** §8.4.3.12.4 GR4 (not locatable) DEFINES the value as NULL, so the store happens and only the EC raise is checking-gated (§14.6.13.1.4). §14.9.39.4 GR14 NAMES its outcome — *“no data items are changed, and the execution of the SET statement is terminated”* — so the store-skip is unconditional and only the raise is gated.

## C# mapping

> Dual-backend rule (SSOT §18 #23): ALL semantics in this section live in backend-neutral bound nodes behind `ICodeGenBackend` (`--backend roslyn|cil`); what follows is the RoslynBackend's C# rendering. Bound nodes carry structured forms (pass mode, carrier construction mode, caller PicMeta) — never pre-rendered C#-specific fragments; a future CIL backend renders the same bound semantics with its own private lowering.

## Hard problems

### BY REFERENCE with category mismatch (arg PIC X(4) seen as formal PIC 9(4)) — same storage reinterpreted, but ManagedRef<string> cannot alias a ManagedRef<long>.

Confine to the sanctioned transient-byte boundary: materialize the arg's value into a scratch byte image, hand the callee a ManagedRef<long> whose get/set decode/encode that buffer, write bytes back through the caller field's codec on return. Same-category (the common case) is always fully typed and never touches this path.

### BY REFERENCE of a group item — `record struct` is a value type; a closure `()=>G` copies on read, so naive aliasing loses callee mutations.

The group carrier round-trips the WHOLE struct per access: get reads a copy, set writes the entire struct back to the caller field, so subordinate-item mutations propagate as a unit at each store. OCCURS table args pass the `T[]` reference directly (element writes are naturally visible).

**ODO full-allocation rule (§14.2.3 GR8):** an occurs-depending group crosses the CALL boundary at its FULL maximum allocation, never the §13.18.38 GR8 current-extent window — §14.2.3 GR8 says BY REFERENCE "operates as if the formal parameter occupies the same storage area as the argument", and the *storage* is the maximum allocation (the ODO window is a *sending-operand* rule for MOVE/compare/INSPECT, not a storage-aliasing rule). BY CONTENT groups follow the same full-allocation rule (GR9 — the copy is of the record). Mechanically: `CodeGen/Verbs/CallEmitter.cs::CallStringRead/CallStringWrite` are the ONE boundary read/write pair (the BY REFERENCE carrier, the BY CONTENT snapshot, the callee copy-in/copy-out, RETURNING) and bypass `OdoGroupPlace.SendingImage()`/`ReceiveInto` for the full `AsImage()`/`FromImage` forms.

**THE VARIABLE-LENGTH CROSSING — a THIRD carrier form (§8.5.1.12; kb/Work PB204).** §14.9.4.3 SR12's flat
prohibition is FORMAT 1's; a Format-2 CALL, a CALL RETURNING and an INVOKE are governed by SR25 → §14.8.2.2 and
§14.8.3.2, which **admit** a variable-length group "subject to compatibility as described in 8.5.1.12". So the
boundary carries three forms, not two:

| the argument's storage | carrier | read / write |
|---|---|---|
| a native fixed-point leaf | `ManagedPointer<T>` over the field's own carrier type | `PlaceRenderer.Read`/`Write` |
| a native FLOATING-POINT leaf | `ManagedPointer<double>` / `<float>` — the field's own carrier (kb/Work PB238) | `PlaceRenderer.Read`/`Write` |
| any fixed-window character storage, a group included | `ManagedPointer<string>` — the record image | `CallEmitter.CallStringRead`/`CallStringWrite` |
| a VARIABLE-LENGTH group | `ManagedPointer<CobolVarGroup>` | `PlaceRenderer.VarGroupImage`/`WriteVarGroupImage` |
| a MANAGED SLOT — class pointer (data / program / function) or class object-reference | `ManagedPointer<ManagedPointer\|ProgramPointer\|FunctionPointer\|«class»?>` — the item's own `PicInfo.ClrType` (kb/Work PB663) | `PlaceRenderer.Read`/`Write` |
| a boolean-expression-1 VALUE (§14.9.4.2 Format 2 BY CONTENT) | `ManagedPointer<string>` — the §8.8.2 bit-string value, resized to the rule-10 width | `BooleanRenderer.Render` (no place; `BoundCallArg.ContentBool`) |

**THE MANAGED SLOT — THE FOURTH FORM, AND ONE CLASSIFICATION FOR BOTH SIDES (kb/Work PB663).** A class-pointer
or class-object-reference item's value IS a managed reference; it has no byte image at all (the same fact
`SlotWindow.CarriedBySlot` states for storage — PB231). Its carrier is therefore its own `PicInfo.ClrType`,
exactly as a numeric leaf's is, and §14.8.2.3.2 removes any need to convert at the boundary: *“If either the
argument or the formal parameter is of class pointer, the corresponding formal parameter or argument shall be of
class pointer and the corresponding items shall be of the same category”*, and its object-reference rules 1–3
force the same universal/interface-name/object-class-name on both ends. `CobolArgAdapt.Slot<T>` therefore
aliases a same-`T` carrier and fails the activation with EC-PROGRAM-ARG-MISMATCH for anything else (kb/Work
PB615 — see "A supplied argument the formal cannot read" below), and `SlotValue<T>` is
§14.2.3 GR10's detached record — which GR10 fills with *“a SET statement”* for this class, i.e. the reference
copy itself.

⛔ **The ACTIVATING and the ACTIVATED sides now read ONE classification**, `CallCrossing` +
`CallEmitter.CrossingOf` / `ProgramEmitter.FormalCrossing`. They were two formulations of one rule — a caller
chain of three place predicates and a callee `bool isNum` — and the callee's had only two arms, so a
`USAGE POINTER` formal was declared `ManagedPointer<string>` over a space image and its first reference was a
Roslyn CS1503 on conforming source. §14.9.4.3 SR10 bars a FORMAT 1 CALL from passing such an item BY REFERENCE,
so the callee arm is reachable only through a Format-2 activation (`AS NESTED`, a prototype) or a separately
compiled activator — which is why the hole survived the whole pointer increment. `LinkageCarrierDriftTests`
walks `PicCategory` itself and pins the invariant that makes the next class automatic: **a formal crosses as a
character image only when its own storage IS a C# string.**

**THE FLOAT LANE (kb/Work PB238).** `CobolArg`'s numeric meta was then a `(Digits, Scale)` pair describing a FIXED-POINT picture, and the
four integer carriers of kb/Work R12 were the whole numeric vocabulary — a float leaf was routed onto the
character image and a computed float BY VALUE argument was narrowed to `(Int128)` **at the caller**. Both lose
the fraction: §14.2.3 GR10 makes a BY VALUE crossing "a COMPUTE statement without the ROUNDED phrase" *into the
formal's description*, so the quantization belongs at the RECEIVER, at the formal's own scale — a caller-side
cast performs it at scale 0 (`01 F FLOAT-LONG VALUE 1.5` reached a `PIC S9(3)V99` formal as `001.00`). The
carrier is therefore the lane's own: `CobolArgAdapt.ReadRealCell`/`WriteRealCell` are the callee half, and
`Num`/`NumValue` quantize through `CobolFloat.ToScaledUnchecked(v, formalScale, Truncation)` — the un-ROUNDED
COMPUTE, once, where the scale is known. A float reaching a CHARACTER formal through GR9's first branch (no
program-specifier, no NESTED phrase — §14.8.2.3.2 / §14.8.2.3.3 rule 1 ask only for the same length there) sees
its STORAGE — its IEEE interchange bytes, through the carried description (kb/Work PB873, below); through
rule 2's branch §14.8.2.3.3's MOVE rules give a float sender no alphanumeric receiver, so that
branch excludes the pairing.

**WHICH SIDE PERFORMS THE LANDING — THE ACTIVATING ONE, WHENEVER IT CAN (kb/Work PB640).** §14.2.3 GR9's
second branch and GR10 both say the linkage record is *"allocated by the activating runtime element during the
process of initiating the activation"*, and both make the argument the sending operand of *"a COMPUTE statement
without the ROUNDED phrase"* into it. Every consequence of that COMPUTE is therefore the **activating** element's:

- its `>>TURN EC-SIZE CHECKING` state decides between §14.7.5's no-phrase rule 4 (EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION is set to
  exist) and DOC-A.1-70's low-order digits — enablement is a property of a compilation group (§14.6.13.1.1),
  never something the callee can be asked about;
- its USE declaratives are what §14.6.13.1.3 selects over; and
- §14.9.4.4 GR3 g) transfers control to the called program only *"if a fatal exception condition has not been
  raised"*, which a landing performed **after** the transfer can no longer honour.

So `CallEmitter.ArgText` wraps every BY CONTENT / BY VALUE argument whose corresponding formal is a fixed-point
numeric item in `CobolArgAdapt.LandForFormal<T>` — one wrapper around every carrier shape, `T` being the
formal's `PicInfo.ClrType` (**not** `DataItem.ElementType`, which answers `"string"` for an image-stored formal
and cannot satisfy the landing's `struct, INumberBase<T>` constraint). The landed `CobolArg` carries the
**formal's** whole description (`Num = formal`), because GR9's last sentence makes the allocated record *the*
argument from that point on — which is exactly what makes the callee-side landing the identity, and what makes an
image-carried formal see the record's own sign (kb/Work PB873).

**When the caller cannot, and why that is the standard's own line.** GR9's FIRST branch — a program with no
program-specifier in the activating element's REPOSITORY paragraph and no NESTED phrase — allocates a record
*"of the same length as the argument"* and moves it *"without conversion"*. There is no COMPUTE there, and no
formal description to perform one against. The set of crossings that ARE a COMPUTE (a prototyped program, a
NESTED CALL, a method, a function) is precisely the set whose formal is knowable at the call site, and
§14.8.2.3.3 draws the same partition for conformance (rule 1 vs rule 2 a)). `CobolArgAdapt.NumValue` / `Num`
therefore keep the landing for that residue and for a non-COBOL activator, sharing `LandScalar` with the
activating side so the two can never answer differently; `BoundCallArg.Formal` is null exactly on that branch.

**The raise needs no new machinery.** EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION is a FATAL ambient gate (`EcEmitter.FatalAmbientGates`)
and a CALL/INVOKE is not an `IArithmeticStatement`, so a statement compiled under EC-SIZE checking already
carries the try/catch that sets the last exception status, runs the §14.9.49 F3 selection and honours RESUME.
The landing is emitted INSIDE the argument expression, so the raise happens while the `CobolArg[]` is being
built — before `ProgramRegistry.CallProgram` is entered, which is GR3 g)'s ordering — and it works in an
EXPRESSION-position activation (a user-defined function reference inside a per-evaluation condition window) as
well as at statement position. The kernel is chosen at COMPILE time from `EcState.SizeTruncationChecking`,
the same way the arithmetic store chooses `checkedLanding`, so a unit with checking off emits the landing it
always had.

**The INVOKE lane is the same rule and was the same defect's other arm.** `OoEmitter`'s BY CONTENT arms already
landed caller-side (§14.8.2.3.3 rule 2 a): *"If the formal parameter is numeric, the conformance rules are the
same as for a COMPUTE statement"*), but always through the UNCHECKED `CobolNum.Store`, so they were silent under
checking too; they now take `NumericRenderer.StoreExpr(…, raiseOnSizeError:)` → `CobolNum.StoreOrRaise`, which
is the same primitive `LandForFormal`'s checked lane uses. The numeric-LITERAL arm went through a bare
`RuntimeApi.NumStore` and joined the other two at the same time — it had been missing the unsigned-wide lane as
well. Pinned per edition by `{2002,2014,2023}/pb640_call_argument_landing_checked` and
`{2002,2014,2023}/pb640_invoke_argument_landing_checked`, and structurally by
`CallAbiNumericCarrierDriftTests.TheCheckedLandingRaisesExactlyWhereTheValueDoesNotFit` plus the
activating-side identity assertions inside `TheGr8ViewAndTheGr10Copy_LandIdentically`.

**THE ONE NUMERIC LANDING — `CobolArgAdapt.Land` (kb/Work PB288).** Every numeric arm of the callee-side adapter
reaches its receiving side through a single private helper, because §14.2.3 GR9 and GR10 describe the *same*
conversion — "if the formal parameter is numeric, a COMPUTE statement without the ROUNDED phrase" into a record
of the FORMAL's description — and GR11 ("references to data-name-1 … are resolved in accordance with their
description in the linkage section") makes the GR8 aliasing view owe the identical value on every access. The
landing has two halves, and each was independently missing somewhere before the extraction:

1. **The scale alignment widens with STORE semantics** — `CobolNum.RescaleStoreCap`, not the unchecked
   `CobolNum.Rescale`. A magnitude the formal cannot hold is §14.7.5 case 3 ("after radix point alignment … is
   further from zero than permitted for the associated resultant data item"), and the no-SIZE-ERROR-phrase,
   checking-off disposition is documented in `CONFORMANCE.md` DOC-A.1-70: the receiver takes the result's
   LOW-ORDER digits at its own scale. It is never the two's complement of an `Int128` intermediate, which is not
   any rule — `BY CONTENT 1000000000000000000000000000000` into a `PIC S9(9)V9(9)` formal used to arrive as
   `873995514.006732800` because the widening formed 10³⁹ and wrapped.
2. **The digit-capacity conformance** — `CobolNum.Store` through the formal's own `NumProfile`. Without it the
   adapter's closing `T.CreateTruncating` is itself a BINARY truncation to the carrier, so an 18-digit argument
   viewed through a `PIC S9(4)V99` formal arrived as `−9838.16` where the low-order digits are `5678.00`.

`NumValue` had half (2) and not (1); `Num` had neither, on both the Int128 and the float lane — the two-arm shape
the shared helper exists to make unrepeatable, pinned by
`CallAbiNumericCarrierDriftTests.TheGr8ViewAndTheGr10Copy_LandIdentically` and by the golden
`2023/pb288_call_argument_scale_landing`, whose rows assert that the two arms and the equivalent inline
MOVE/COMPUTE all print the same characters. The write-back half of the GR8 view takes the same store-semantics
widening; its receiving *capacity* stays the caller's own carrier discipline (`WriteNumericCell`), because
the write-back lands in the caller's cell, whose own type is the capacity that applies there.

**THE CARRIED DESCRIPTION IS A WHOLE `NumProfile` (kb/Work PB873).** `CobolArg` is `(Mode, Carrier, NumProfile?
Num)`; `Digits` and `Scale` are derived from `Num`. A native cell holds a VALUE, but the storage it stands for has
a REPRESENTATION — the operational sign and its position (§13.18.52), the usage's byte form (§13.18.60.4) — and a
formal that sees the argument as characters sees that representation: §14.2.3 GR8 "operates as if the formal
parameter occupies the same storage area as the argument", and GR9's first branch moves the argument "without
conversion". The `(Digits, Scale)` pair it replaced could spell only a digit run, so `CobolArgAdapt.Text` and
`TextValue` each built the image from a hard-coded `Signed = false` profile: `-12.34` in a `PIC S9(4)V99`
argument reached a REDEFINED (image-carried) `PIC S9(4)V99` formal as `00123D` (+12.34) where the storage holds
`00123M`, on both arms. Now:

- the ACTIVATING side emits the argument's own `PicInfo.ProfileInitializer` for every elementary numeric place
  (a reference-modified view and a USAGE INDEX item carry `null`), and a signed DISPLAY profile of the value's own
  digits and scale for a literal or a computed expression (signed exactly when the value can be negative);
- `Text` renders the cell through THE record-image codec under that description (`CobolNum.FormatImage` /
  `FormatImageFloat`) and writes back through its inverse, splicing only the formal's positions (GR8);
- `TextValue` is GR10's record, "a data item of the same description as the formal parameter": it lands the
  argument through the shared `LandScalar` into the FORMAL's profile (emitted beside it) and renders that;
- an image-carried numeric ARGUMENT's carrier text is decoded through ITS OWN description, not the formal's
  (the operand text `OperandText.FieldImage` produces), before GR9/GR10's COMPUTE.

**A supplied argument the formal cannot read (kb/Work PB615).** Every adapter's type switch used to end in the
§14.9.4.4 GR12 OMITTED carrier, whose read raises EC-PROGRAM-ARG-OMITTED only under checking and otherwise answers
`default` — a supplied argument read as ZERO, silently, indistinguishable from an omitted one. It is not omitted:
a carrier outside the formal's crossing form is a §14.8.2 conformance violation, and §14.9.4.4 GR3 d) answers it
"the program call is not successful" with EC-PROGRAM-ARG-MISMATCH. `CobolArgAdapt.Unreadable<T>` raises exactly
that through the same `CobolCallException` the GR3d count check and `StoreReturn`'s `Undeliverable` use, marked
`RaisedAtAdoption`: adoption runs inside `ICobolProgram.Call` but before any of the element's statements, so the
activation boundary (`ProgramTable.CallProgram`) CONSUMES the mark instead of setting `ControlTransferred` — the
failure is this CALL's GR3h (its ON EXCEPTION phrase runs), and a boundary further out, for which control had
been transferred, marks it in the ordinary GR3i way. `Omitted<T>` is now reached only for a genuinely omitted
argument. Golden `2002/pb615_unreadable_argument_carrier`; unit

**⛔ A FIXED-LENGTH GROUP OPPOSITE A VARIABLE-LENGTH ONE (kb/Work PB965).** §8.5.1.12.1 admits the pair ("only
one of the operands may be a variable-length group") and §14.8.2.2 / §14.8.3.2 import it into every boundary. The
fixed group decomposes into the same `CobolVarGroup` (`FromFixedImage`) and is rebuilt from it (`ToFixedImage`)
at the spans of ITS tables that CORRESPOND to the variable-length group's dynamic-capacity tables — and
correspondence is a fact about the PAIR (§8.5.1.12.2: "they occupy the same relative byte positions within their
groups"), so it is computed by ONE walk, `CobolVarGroup.CorrespondingSpans(fixedLayout, varLayout)`, over each
group's §8.5.1.12 LAYOUT (`VariableLengthCompatibility.Layout` — `(kind, chars, elementChars)` triples: fixed run,
fixed table, occurs-depending table, dynamic-capacity table, dynamic-length item). The corresponding fixed table
crosses at its fixed occurrence count (§8.5.1.12.3 sentence 3); a fixed table opposite plain bytes is plain
material (the former `FlatTableSpans` lifted EVERY table and moved the wrong one); a dynamic-capacity table past the
fixed group's last character gets no component (§8.5.1.12.2's last sentence — the receiver's §14.6.9.4 space fill).
The two sides of a CALL are compiled apart, so each side's LAYOUT TRAVELS: `CobolArg.Layout` carries an argument's
(or the RETURNING receiver's) layout, emitted for a group with a table or a variable-length member; the formal's
adapter (`CobolArgAdapt.VarGroup/VarGroupValue(args, i, formalLayout)`) and the RETURNING legs
(`StoreReturnGroup`, `StoreReturn(ret, CobolVarGroup, layout)`) pair them; a table-less fixed group states only
its length (`CobolVarGroup.FixedRun`). The §14.9.25.4 GR9 MOVE and the typed INVOKE know both descriptions at
compile time and call the SAME walk there (`VariableLengthCompatibility.CorrespondingSpans`). ⚠ DETERMINATION: a
callee cannot grow a fixed-length argument's table past its fixed extent — that storage has no more occurrences —
so the write-back fits each component to its table as §14.6.9.2 fits a dynamic sending table into a non-dynamic
receiving one ("superfluous elements are not moved"; missing ones are space filled). Goldens

`pb965-fixed-table-off-position`; unit `BoundaryGroupCorrespondenceTests`.

**⛔ THE REVERSE PAIR, AND THE SIZE RULE A VARIABLE-LENGTH PAIR TAKES (kb/Work PB965, finisher).** A variable-length
group has no length of its own: its collapsed `ImageWidth` counts a dynamic-capacity table as one element, which
§8.5.1.12.3 grants only to two MATCHING dynamic-capacity tables. So `OoConformance.DescriptionMismatch` — the one
comparator behind COBOLNET1688 (CALL argument), 1736 (CALL RETURNING) and 0828 (INVOKE) — decides the size question
per activation mode once either side is a variable-length group: a RETURNING pair takes compatibility alone (§14.8.3.2's
length sentence applies only when "neither of them is strongly typed or a variable length group"); BY REFERENCE,
§14.8.2.2 rule 1 binds only an ALPHANUMERIC group item (§3.11 excludes a variable-length group), so two
variable-length groups take compatibility alone and a fixed group opposite one compares in the lengths §8.5.1.12.3
sentence 3 gives the PAIR ("the dynamic-capacity table is considered to be the same length as the corresponding
table") — `VariableLengthCompatibility.PairCharWidths`, the SAME walk that decides the correspondence. Override and
prototype signature equality (§9.3.8.2.3) keeps strict equality. The admitted VARIABLE-into-FIXED pairs run through
the same correspondence: every group formal states its layout to `CobolArgAdapt.Text` / `TextValue`
(`ProgramEmitter.GroupFormalLayout`; `System.Array.Empty<int>()` for a table-less group, read as `FixedRun(width)`),
whose variable-carrier arm reads the argument through `ToFixedImage`; the typed INVOKE does the same at compile time
(`OoEmitter.VarPlaceSpans`), including both mixed RETURNING directions. ⚠ DETERMINATION: a formal with a FIXED
occurrence count cannot change the argument table's current capacity, so a BY REFERENCE store OVERLAYS the argument's
storage (`CobolVarGroup.OverlayFixedImage`, §14.2.3 GR8): the occurrences the argument has are written, one it lacks
is not, one past the formal's count is untouched, and material past a prefix formal survives. Goldens

**An OCCURS DEPENDING group argument's two lengths.** §14.8.2.2: "For an argument or formal parameter that is
described as an occurs-depending group item passed by reference, the maximum length is used. For an occurs-depending
group item passed by content, the length of the argument is determined by the rules of the OCCURS clause for a
sending data item." BY REFERENCE reads `CallEmitter.CallStringRead` (the whole allocation); BY CONTENT reads
`CallEmitter.CallContentRead` — the §13.18.38.4 GR8 current extent through `PlaceRenderer.SendingGroupImage` — at the
CALL snapshot and at the INVOKE BY CONTENT arm alike. Golden `2002/pb965_odo_group_argument_length`.

`CobolVarGroup` is `(string Fixed, string[] Dynamic)` and is the §8.5.1.12 model itself, not an encoding:
`Fixed` is the group's image with every variable-length component collapsed to nothing — the exact accounting
§8.5.1.12.3 states the relation in, which is why two COMPATIBLE groups lay it out identically — and `Dynamic`
carries each component's current content in declaration order, which §8.5.1.12.2's positional correspondence puts
one-for-one on both sides. A receiving dynamic-capacity table recovers its capacity by dividing its component by
its OWN element width, legitimate because §8.5.1.12.3 admits corresponding tables only "when the byte length of
their elements is equal". Nested variable-length groups FLATTEN into the same carrier (`CobolVarGroup.Slice`
hands one its window back), because the relation is stated over relative byte positions and is blind to the
declaration tree. The emitted pair is `AsVarImage()`/`FromVarImage()`, gated on `DataItem.CurrentExtentImageCapable`
— **the same** capability the §14.9.11.4 GR7 DISPLAY format uses, so a group that displays is a group that
crosses. The one crossing-form predicate is `CallEmitter.CallPlaceIsVarGroup` (CALL/RETURNING) and
`OoEmitter.OoCrossingType` (the INVOKE signature, box lanes and marshaling); the ADMISSION is decided once, at
bind, by `VariableLengthCompatibility.Mismatch` through `OoConformance.DescriptionMismatch` — the same comparator
the argument, RETURNING and override/implements checks all read.

**Tier-C at the boundary, in BOTH halves.** A group with no boundary image at all (a pointer/object-class leaf,
or a variable-length shape outside the current-extent gate — an OCCURS DEPENDING member, a runtime-length item
inside a table element; `DataItem.BoundaryImageCapable`) stages the documented Tier-C loud rather than
crossing. ⛔ The WRITE half does not test that predicate itself: `CallStringWrite` hands **every** non-`RedefViewPlace`
group to `PlaceRenderer.WriteFullGroupImage`, whose arm order owns the guard, so the read/write lockstep this
paragraph asserts is a STRUCTURAL fact rather than a coincidence two guards have to maintain. It was not, once:
the write half carried its own `IsImageCapable` conjunct and an imageless group fell through to a raw
`PlaceRenderer.Write`, rendering `_G = <string>;` — a backend CS0029 — while the read half correctly staged the
loud (kb/Work PB177 arm B, the eighth two-arm-dispatch instance). The exposure was not only at a CALL site: the
CALLEE's own LINKAGE formal copy-in (`ProgramEmitter`) and Report Writer's `CONTROL IS <group>` both call this
pair, and separate compilation means the caller-side `ArgText` screen gives the callee nothing.

**Boundary-copy limitation (known, accepted — re-architect only if a test ever observes it):** group formals are boundary-copied (`FromImage` at activation entry, `AsImage` copy-out at activation exit), not live-aliased; a STRICT reading of GR8 implies live sharing (a caller-side mutation of the group mid-call — e.g. from a re-entered container — would not be seen by the callee until the next activation). No NIST program observes mid-call group mutation from the caller's side; elementary formals ARE live-aliased (carrier-resident, per-access).

### RECURSIVE programs and functions/methods need per-activation data; a `static class Program` cannot recurse or hold per-activation copies.

Make each program an instantiable class. RECURSIVE/function/method → new instance per activation; plain program → cached singleton (last-used persistence). Non-RECURSIVE re-entry while active → EC-PROGRAM-RECURSIVE-CALL. This forces instance-ization of the program-class shape now (today's static Program is replaced).

### Opaque ABI for dynamic CALL / cross-assembly: the caller cannot see the callee's LINKAGE to build typed args.

Uniform ICobolProgram.Call(CobolArgs) where CobolArgs is an ordered list of (PassMode, caller PicMeta, carrier) — the typed analog of the rejected ManagedPointer[]. Callee maps positionally onto LINKAGE items. Same-assembly + statically-resolvable + PIC-conforming calls specialize to a direct typed method (Run) as a fast path.

### GOBACK and EXIT PROGRAM terminate a unit differently by activation context — and the two statements DIVERGE in the not-under-a-caller (main) case.

Distinguish by BOTH the statement and the activation context (§14.9.18.4 / §14.9.14.4):
- In a CALLED program (under the control of a calling runtime element) GOBACK and EXIT PROGRAM both terminate the program and return control to the activator (§14.9.18.4 GR2 / §14.9.14.4 GR3); the activation result is the current value of the PROCEDURE DIVISION header RETURNING item (§14.9.18.4 GR2), and a RAISING phrase stages its exception condition for the activator.
- In the MAIN program (not under the control of a caller) the two DIVERGE: GOBACK operates as a STOP statement and terminates the run unit (§14.9.18.4 GR3 — a RAISING phrase is then ignored, and a WITH NORMAL/ERROR STATUS reaches the OS as the exit code); EXIT PROGRAM is treated as a CONTINUE — a no-op that falls through to the next statement, raising no exception condition even when RAISING is specified (§14.9.14.4 GR2).

Mechanism (settled, SSOT §9.4 + §18 #10): GOBACK raises `ProgramReturn`; EXIT PROGRAM raises `ProgramReturn` ONLY while the unit is active as a callee (guarded on the `__asCalled` activation flag) and is inert otherwise. A `ProgramReturn` is caught at the unit's own activation/dispatch boundary: for a called unit it returns control (and the header RETURNING value) to the activator; for the main unit's GOBACK it returns to that boundary and the run unit then ends, the main-program status flushing as the process exit code. The distinct `StopRun` signal (`src/Cobol.Net.Runtime/Control/Signals/StopRun.cs`) is the run-unit-termination half (STOP RUN, and the STOP-status exit-code flush); `ProgramReturn` is the called-program-return signal, not a refinement of `StopRun`.

### CANCEL must reset a program to initial state on next CALL, close its open files, cascade to contained programs, and be a no-op for never-called/already-canceled or active programs.

Registry.Cancel(name) drops/marks the singleton for re-init (WS reset to VALUE on next CALL), runs implicit CLOSE on its open files (§14.9.5 GR9), cascades to contained programs in reverse order (GR4), raises EC-PROGRAM-CANCEL-ACTIVE if active (GR5), no-ops if never-called/canceled (GR7); EXTERNAL data is NOT reset (GR8).

### Arguments must be evaluated exactly once at CALL time (§14.9.4.4 GR3a) even though carriers are lazy accessors.

Capture subscript/ref-mod bound expressions into locals BEFORE constructing carriers (e.g. `int _i=(int)I-1;` then close over `_i`), so re-evaluating the accessor inside the callee does not re-evaluate the COBOL subscript expression.

## Edge cases

- Transitive passing mode: at the CALL site the BY CONTENT and BY REFERENCE phrases are transitive across the following arguments until the next such phrase, defaulting to BY REFERENCE (§14.9.4.4 GR5 — a Format-1 CALL has no BY VALUE); BY VALUE (only in the Format-2 program-prototype CALL) rides the argument-correspondence BY REFERENCE/BY VALUE transitivity (§14.2.3 GR4). One CallBinder mode-threading pass threads all three, drop its byte emission.

**FORMAT 2'S ARGUMENT CLASSIFICATION — ONE reduction, then the mode (§14.9.4.4 GR8 + GR9; kb/Work PB238).**
GR8 — "An argument that consists merely of a single identifier or literal is regarded as an identifier or
literal rather than an arithmetic or boolean expression" — is a rule about EVERY Format-2 argument, not about
one spelling of one. Two grammar facts make it load-bearing and they are the same two INVOKE faces:
`arithmeticExpression` subsumes `dataReference` and every numeric literal, and the `{boolExprAhead()}?`-gated
`booleanExpression` alternative subsumes both of those in turn (its leaf is `valueOperand`, and the predicate's
scan runs to the statement's period, so an earlier argument can land in a boolean node on a LATER argument's
B-operator). `CallBinder.Gr8Classify` is therefore THE reduction, shared by the BY CONTENT arm, the BY VALUE
arm and both keyword-less arms: it unwraps an operator-free boolean node to its bare `valueOperand` — **both**
legs, `arithmeticExpression | nonNumericLiteral` — and recovers a sole `dataReference` from an expression node.
Only the residue binds as an expression.

The MODE then comes from GR9, never from the copy-out: a keyword-less argument that meets §14.9.4.3 SR3 is
identifier-2 and takes BY REFERENCE (9a1); one that does not — a literal, a constant-name (which §13.10.4 GR1
substitutes a literal for), an object property — takes BY CONTENT (9a2); and a BY VALUE formal makes it BY VALUE
(9b) whatever the argument is. §14.9.4.3 SR20's carve-out is the object-property leg: "BY CONTENT may be omitted
when identifier-4 is an object property", so a bare property reference is a SENDING occurrence (SR17) and
`ReferenceResolver.IsObjectPropertyReference` routes it to Content — binding it BY REFERENCE made
`BoundStores` classify the occurrence ReadWrite and invoke the §8.4.3.9.4 SET accessor. SR23 ("literal-2 shall be
a numeric literal" when it OR ITS FORMAL carries BY VALUE) is `COBOLNET1762`, screened on both spellings and, for
a constant-name, on the literal §13.10.4 GR1/GR2 substitutes.
- Bare argument resolution (§14.9.4.4 GR9): a bare arg with a BY REFERENCE formal becomes BY REFERENCE if it is a valid receiving operand, else BY CONTENT (e.g. a literal/expression).
- **OMITTED / trailing-omitted argument (GR11–12), and FORWARDING one (kb/Work PB133 wave C → PB165).** The
  carrier is Null; the §8.8.4.8 omitted-argument condition IS `IsNull`; referencing an omitted formal outside
  the two sanctioned forms raises EC-PROGRAM-ARG-OMITTED through the CA10 checked-raise gate **in the callee's**
  engine (checking off stays lenient with the documented benign-empty read — GR12 leaves the content undefined).
  GR12's exemption — *“except as an argument”* — and §8.8.4.8.4 GR1c's TRANSITIVE omission are ONE emitted
  fact: `CallEmitter.WholeFormal` recognizes an argument that IS a whole formal parameter **by identity against
  the unit's own `LinkageFormal` items** (`CallUnitState.Formals`) — never by a `__lnkp` name match, which could
  only see a CARRIER-RESIDENT formal — and `CallEmitter.Forwarded` guards EVERY mode's carrier build with the
  incoming carrier's presence, so the forward neither reads the formal (a BY CONTENT snapshot is a read) nor
  loses its omitted state (a group formal's copy-in field always answers `IsNull` false). A SUBITEM, a
  subscripted reference and a reference-modified view are deliberately excluded: GR1c speaks of an argument
  that *is* a formal parameter, and referencing inside an omitted one is exactly the error GR12 states.
  ⛔ **The recognition and the presence test span EVERY activation ABI (kb/Work PB757).** The presence fact is
  `Binding/Model/OmittedProbe` — `Carrier` (a program/function formal's null carrier) or `MethodFlag` (a method
  formal's `bool` presence parameter, COBOLNET_OO_DESIGN D6) — and `CallUnitState.WholeFormalProbe` recognizes a
  whole formal of EITHER kind (`Formals` for a program, `MethodFormals` inside a method body). `CallEmitter.OmittedTest`
  is the one rendering; the §8.8.4.8 condition, `Forwarded` (CALL and user-defined-function arguments) and the INVOKE
  argument lowering all call it, so a CALL inside a method forwards an omitted method formal as the null carrier and
  an INVOKE inside a program forwards an omitted program formal as `true`.
- **User-defined-function arguments ride the same model (§8.4.3.2.3 SR9, §8.4.3.2.4 GR7; kb/Work PB757).** `UdfBinder`
  binds `FUNCTION f(… OMITTED …)` to an `Omitted` `BoundCallArg` (the null carrier above) when the formal is OPTIONAL —
  `COBOLNET2238` otherwise — and admits fewer arguments than formals when every trailing formal is OPTIONAL
  (§14.8.2.1), the callee's adapters answering a missing slot as omitted exactly as for CALL.
- Argument/parameter count mismatch → EC-PROGRAM-ARG-MISMATCH (when checking enabled) or diagnostic; a missing parameter behaves as omitted.
- **Argument DESCRIPTION conformance is ONE rule set, written once, for CALL and INVOKE alike (§14.9.4.3 SR25
  → §14.8.2; kb/Work PB133 → PB204 → PB165).** Wherever the callee's PD header is known at BIND — the AS NESTED
  containment table, or a program prototype's §12.3.8.4 GR10 a) definition — `CallBinder`'s conformance loop runs
  the whole of §14.8.2 against it, and every rule lives in `OoConformance`: `DescriptionMismatch` for
  §14.8.2.3.2 / §14.8.2.2 (BY REFERENCE, identical description with the rule-1 group-prefix allowance and
  §8.5.1.12 variable-length compatibility), and `ContentMismatch` + the four value-shape rules for §14.8.2.3.3
  (BY CONTENT / BY VALUE: 2a COMPUTE for a numeric formal, 2b SET for an index item, 2c ANY LENGTH, 2d MOVE via
  §14.9.25.3 Table 16, plus the class-pointer / object-reference SET paragraph).
  `CallBinder.ContentConformanceReason` dispatches on the BOUND argument's shape — identifier, boolean
  expression, arithmetic expression, alphanumeric literal, numeric literal — and a constant-name needs no arm
  because §13.10.4 GR1 has already substituted its literal. The verdict is COBOLNET1688, the same code the BY
  REFERENCE arm uses, because it is the same obligation. ⚠ The §14.8.2.3.3 rules were once PRIVATE to INVOKE, and
  the CALL lane therefore had no by-content screen at all while `CobolArgAdapt`'s converting views silently
  adapted whatever arrived; EXTRACTION, not a second copy, is what closed it. The DYNAMIC Format-1 lane still
  checks only the COUNT at runtime — no per-formal description facts are registered with the program table
  (kb/Work PB165, weighed against P13's prototype registry).
- RETURNING a group item: an **image-form** group — every leaf `DataItem.ElementImageCapable`, i.e. character-stored OR any pinned numeric byte form (zoned DISPLAY, binary, packed, COMP-5, IEEE float, INDEX) — is carried; the caller temp deep-clones the description and the image crosses via AsImage/FromImage (§8.4.3.2.4 GR1; §14.2.2 SR5 places no category restriction, and none on usage either). Only the strong-typed / internal-REDEFINES / variable-length shapes and a **pointer- or object-class LEAF** stage loud (the per-shape COBOLNET1510 residues in `UdfBinder.UdfReturningResidue`). A byte-form numeric leaf was listed here as a residue until PB164's F8 widened the screen off its hand-rolled DISPLAY-only usage union onto the derived predicate (kb/Work PB199).
- **RETURNING delivery is TOTAL (§14.9.4.4 GR4; kb/Work PB165).** With no caller target the value is discarded —
  GR4 has no receiver. With one, `CobolArgAdapt.StoreReturn` **stores or raises**, never no-ops: legs exist for
  every `ElementType` the compiler emits (`long`/`ulong`/`Int128`/`UInt128`, `double`, `string`,
  `CobolVarGroup`, `ManagedPointer`, `ProgramPointer`, `CobolObject`), and a pair with no leg raises
  `CobolCallException("EC-PROGRAM-ARG-MISMATCH")` citing §14.8.3 and §14.9.4.4 GR3d. (The `double` leg was
  missing until kb/Work PB962's sweep: a `USAGE FLOAT-LONG` returning item did not compile, CS0315.) A silent
  discard is the one outcome GR4's *“is placed into identifier-3”* excludes.
- **⛔ The RETURNING item crosses as a `CobolArg` — carrier AND description (kb/Work PB962 + PB965).**
  `ICobolProgram.Call(CobolArg[] args, CobolArg? returning)`: the activating element builds the returning item's
  `CobolArg` exactly as it builds a BY REFERENCE argument's (`CallEmitter.ReturningArgText` over the one
  `PlaceDescription`), because its storage is the activating element's (§14.2.3 GR6 NOTE 1) and the delivery,
  which runs in the activated element, needs the RECEIVER's shape. The activated element passes its SENDING
  item's description beside the content (`ProgramEmitter.ReturningDelivery`). **The delivery is a CONTENT
  transfer** — §14.6.5: the result "is the content of the data item referenced by that RETURNING phrase" — under
  the one description a conforming pair shares (§14.8.3.3 requires the same PICTURE and USAGE): a fixed-point
  item's native value lands in a native cell and, in an image-carried receiver, as its representation under the
  description (`CobolNum.FormatDisplay` — the value's C# text dropped the sign's over-punch); an image-carried
  item's text lands as it stands in an image-carried receiver and decoded under the description
  (`CobolNum.ParseDisplay`, which answers for any content) in a native cell. Before PB962 the text leg re-parsed
  the content as a C# number and ABORTED the run unit whenever it was not a digit run (spaces). ⚠ A NATIVE cell
  holds a value, so content that is not a valid numeric representation reads as the value `ParseDisplay` gives
  it — the same residue every character view of a native numeric cell has. The character legs of a
  description-free sender (an alphanumeric item into a numeric receiver — a pair §14.8.3.3 does not admit) still
  read the result's digit image, loud when there is none. A ZONED image-carried item's boundary text IS its
  storage, so `CallEmitter.CallStringWrite` stores it as it stands (fitted) rather than decoding and re-encoding
  it, which lost exactly the non-digit content; a BINARY/PACKED item's boundary text is still its operand text.
- CALL to a NULL program-pointer → EC-PROGRAM-PTR-NULL; unresolvable name → EC-PROGRAM-NOT-FOUND; both are activation failures and take the GR3h partition below.
- **The GR3h/GR3i partition of a failed activation, and the ACTIVATION BOUNDARY that makes it decidable.** §14.9.4.4 GR3h routes a failure on THREE independent facts, and the emitted CALL expresses each one separately (`CallEmitter.EmitCall`; kb/Work PB233):
  1. **Which phrase is written.** Only ON EXCEPTION diverts — GR3h item 1 names it, and §14.6.13.1.3 #1 admits only "a conditional phrase without the NOT phrase". A CALL carrying only NOT ON EXCEPTION is governed by item 2 or item 3 exactly as a phrase-free CALL is. (It formerly emitted the catch on *either* phrase and silently discarded the failure.)
  2. **Which family the condition belongs to.** Item 1 admits "any of the EC-PROGRAM or EC-EXTERNAL exception conditions"; every other condition the carrier can raise — today EC-FUNCTION-NOT-FOUND (§8.4.3.2.4 GR6b) — takes item 2's second disjunct, i.e. the applicable exception processing statements, with no ON EXCEPTION escape. The partition is written once, as `CobolCallException.IsProgramOrExternal`, and the carriable name set once as `CobolCallException.CarriedNames` (kept equal to the raise sites by `CallExceptionCarrierDriftTests`).
  3. **Whether control had already been transferred.** GR3h speaks only of a program that "was not successfully called"; GR3i says that once it was, "the ON EXCEPTION phrase, if specified, is ignored". The CALL site cannot know this — the runtime does, so `ProgramTable.CallProgram` marks `CobolCallException.ControlTransferred` on anything escaping `inst.Call`, and every emitted arm filters on `!ControlTransferred`. The mark is monotone, so a failure deep in a call chain is an activation failure for exactly one CALL site and post-transfer for every site above it.
  Because the boundary is "escaped from `inst.Call`", GR3e's external-conformance check — an activation-ATTEMPT step that precedes GR3g's transfer — is hoisted OUT of the callee body onto the ABI as `ICobolProgram.DescribeExternals()`, which the boundary calls before `Call`. The main-program entry (`Activate`) calls it itself.
- ON EXCEPTION / ON OVERFLOW edition surface: `[NOT] ON EXCEPTION` is ANSI X3.23-1985 CALL Format 2 surface (CCVS-85 IC222A tests both phrases), valid at EVERY edition; `ON OVERFLOW` is the 74-carried synonym, valid 85–2014 and REMOVED at 2023 (`VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE.md` row 3 / E.2 item 1c → COBOLNET0882). Both spellings bind to the same phrase fields, so the GR3h partition above applies unchanged at 85. NOT ON EXCEPTION runs only on a successful, non-EC-propagating return (§14.9.4.4 GR3i).
- Variable-occurrence (OCCURS DEPENDING ON) BY CONTENT arg: copy the maximum size; callee honors the DEPENDING-ON value (§14.2.3 GR9).
- BASED item with no associated pointer (unallocated / after FREE): reference is undefined → IsNull guard; double FREE / use-after-free guarded.
- EXTERNAL items survive CANCEL (§14.9.5 GR8) and are shared across all programs describing the same external name (§8.6.7).
- COMMON nested program is callable by sibling contained programs (§8.4.6.3); non-COMMON only by its direct container.
- Recursive COMMON program sharing state — deterministic, allowed.
- REDEFINES-a-pointer-as-bytes or writing a pointer to a file → ISO implementor-defined; reject as undefined (a managed ref cannot serialize to stable bytes).
- ADDRESS OF as a sending operand passed BY REFERENCE across a CALL (address-identifier, §14.9.4 SR3-4) passes the carrier itself.
- **A character-carried formal has THREE length regimes, and `ProgramEmitter.FormalTextCarrier` is the one place
  they are distinguished (kb/Work PB165).** ANY LENGTH (§13.18.2 GR1) — the formal's length IS the argument's,
  fixed for the activation: the full-string view (`CobolArgAdapt.Text`, width sentinel −1). DYNAMIC LENGTH
  (§13.18.19.4 GR1/GR2) — the length VARIES during execution, minimum zero, maximum the LIMIT phrase:
  `CobolArgAdapt.DynText`, a full-string view whose store carries §8.5.1.10.4's replace-and-truncate rule.
  Fixed — the declared width window (§14.2.3 GR8: the callee touches only its formal's character positions).
  ⚠ The DYNAMIC LENGTH arm is not optional cosmetics: §13.18.19.3 SR1 pins such an item's PICTURE at exactly ONE
  symbol, so falling to the fixed arm delivers a ONE-CHARACTER formal for every such crossing, in both passing
  modes. BY VALUE cannot reach the dynamic arm — §14.2.2 SR2 admits only class numeric, message-tag, object or
  pointer BY VALUE.
- SET ADDRESS OF on a LINKAGE item re-points the callee's formal mid-execution — the carrier field is reassigned; subsequent refs read the new target.

## Edition gating (G1 — four per-`--std` compilers in one executable)

Interprogram constructs vary heavily by edition. Every edition-varying construct carries TWO co-equal obligations: (1) the complete per-edition ISO-spec behavior in every edition that HAS it; (2) the correct DIAGNOSTIC in every edition that LACKS it (not-yet-introduced or removed). Tests (NIST etc.) only VERIFY; they never SCOPE. At each `DialectLevel` (85/2002/2014/2023) the lacks-it diagnostic is a targeted `COBOLNET-` diagnostic — never a generic parse error. Every row gets (construct × edition) coverage per `docs/VERSION_TEST_MATRIX_DESIGN.md` (the (construct × edition) matrix; Phase 0 done); verify rows against `docs/VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE.md` (the 130-row edition-change checklist — 2002→2023 deltas ONLY; it has NO 85→2002 rows, so derive 85↔2002 gating from the 2002 standard) and the per-edition spec text.

- **All editions (85+):** CALL USING BY REFERENCE / BY CONTENT, CALL … ON OVERFLOW (removed at 2023 — below), CALL … [NOT] ON EXCEPTION (X3.23-1985 CALL Format 2 — CCVS-85 IC222A tests both phrases), CANCEL, nested/contained programs, COMMON / INITIAL, GLOBAL / EXTERNAL, EXIT PROGRAM.
- **2002+ (under `--std 85` reject with an "introduced in COBOL-2002" diagnostic):** CALL … BY VALUE AND the procedure-division-header USING BY VALUE phrase (twin registry rows `call-by-value-2002` / `pd-header-by-value-2002`); RETURNING (CALL and the PROCEDURE DIVISION header — the ISO §14.9.18 GOBACK/EXIT PROGRAM carry NO RETURNING operand; a `GOBACK`/`EXIT PROGRAM` `RETURNING`/`GIVING` operand is an accepted vendor extension over that header-only mechanism, `GobackReturning2002`); OMITTED arguments + the omitted-argument condition; PROGRAM-ID … RECURSIVE (`program-id-recursive-2002`); the REPOSITORY PROGRAM entry — §12.3.8.2's program-specifier, and with it every program-prototype reference in CALL Format 2 and CANCEL (`repository-program-2002`, D6); LOCAL-STORAGE (`local-storage-section-2002`); GOBACK; USAGE POINTER / ADDRESS OF / SET ADDRESS OF; BASED / ALLOCATE / FREE; ANY LENGTH; and the whole EC-PROGRAM-* exception machinery (at `--std 85` CALL failures surface only via the ON OVERFLOW/EXCEPTION phrases / abnormal termination — no EC names, no `>>TURN`).
- **2014+:** `>>TURN` of EC-PROGRAM exceptions in a calling element is FLAG-02-flagged (`VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE.md` row 97).
- **2023:** CALL … ON OVERFLOW is REMOVED (row 3, E.2 item 1c) — reject at 2023, accept at 85/2002/2014; EXIT PROGRAM is archaic (rows 89/126) — flag at 2023; GOBACK gains the STOP-style status phrase (row 75) — 2023-only; EXTERNAL-item conformance exception checking is added (row 15).

## Open questions — ALL SETTLED (`COBOLNET_DESIGN.md` §18 + the owner-approved cross-assembly probe)

- Program model — **SETTLED (§18 #8):** ONE `.g.cs` + ONE assembly per compilation; multiple/contained programs → nested classes with same-assembly direct CALL (the typed fast path everywhere). A per-unit/by-name separately-compiled `.dll` option is a later need and, when used, crosses the uniform opaque ABI (typed fast path unavailable across assemblies).
- Carrier name + representation — **SETTLED (§18 #12):** the carrier is the typed `ManagedRef<T>` (NOT the abandoned `byte[]`+offset+length form); the public name **`ManagedPointer`** is kept over the typed carrier (owner preference). The `feedback_one_mechanism_per_job` memory has been updated to the typed form.
- Cross-assembly dynamic CALL discovery — **SETTLED (owner-approved): the `__CobolModule` registrar + sibling-assembly probe.** Every compiled module emits ONE public well-known discovery surface, `public static class __CobolModule { public static void Register() }`, performing the same `ProgramRegistry.Register(...)` calls `Program.Main` uses (Main delegates to it — one canonical registration body; the generated program classes stay `internal`, so the registrar IS the reflection surface — `CodeGen/ProgramEmitter.cs::EmitEntryWrapper`). `ProgramRegistry.ResolveVisible`'s rule-4 fallthrough probes `AppContext.BaseDirectory` for `<name>.dll` (exact name, then a case-insensitive scan — Linux), loads it into `AssemblyLoadContext.Default`, invokes `__CobolModule.Register()`, and retries rule 4 once; probed names are cached hit-or-miss (one I/O probe per name per run unit) and an unloadable/foreign dll is a quiet miss → the ordinary EC-PROGRAM-NOT-FOUND surface. Spec basis: §14.6.1 ("A run unit contains one or more runtime modules"), §14.9.4.4 GR3b (the locate step is implementor-defined beyond §8.4.6.3 name scope). The prebuilt-static-registry profile (AOT/trimming) remains possible — pre-register every name and the probe never fires. Known edge (accepted): a probed module registering a containment PATH that collides with an existing registration overwrites it; per-outermost program-names are unique in a conforming run unit (§8.4.6.3), so collisions arise only from non-conforming compositions.
- Category-mismatch BY REFERENCE byte boundary — **SETTLED (§18 #1; SSOT §9.4):** the transient, never-persisted byte image IS the one sanctioned boundary for this narrow case (category mismatch is legal COBOL exercised by NIST — not a compile error); same-category stays 100% typed.
