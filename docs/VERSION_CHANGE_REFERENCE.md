# Version Change Reference — Edition-to-Edition Changes of Standard COBOL

> **STATUS BANNER — LIVE reference (type: LEDGER / REFERENCE).**
>
> **Purpose.** This document is the **version-gating checklist** for the COBOL.NET compiler (`cobol.exe`, the greenfield `src/Cobol.Net.*` — the legacy `CobolSharp.*` oracle is reference-only). It
> catalogues every edition-to-edition change of standard COBOL documented in the ISO/IEC 1989:2023 spec
> (`specs/ISO_COBOL.md`) so that the compiler can drive **correct version-gating**:
> - every **behavior** that changed across editions must be gated by the targeted standard via
>   `DialectLevel` / `--std` (cite [[feedback_four_editions_one_compiler]]);
> - **new features** are enabled only at `>=` their introducing edition;
> - **obsolete / archaic** elements are flagged (and, where the spec schedules removal, gated off in newer dialects).
>
> **Scope limit (read before gating).** The 2023 spec documents the **2014→2023 delta completely** (Annex E for
> substantive changes, Annex F for archaic/obsolete lists, plus inline per-section NOTES). The **85→2002** and
> **2002→2014** deltas are only **partially** documented in the 2023 spec — they surface here mainly through the
> **FLAG-02** directive (§7.3.14, which points at the 2002↔2014 incompatibilities) and a few inline references; their
> **full** change lists live in the ISO/IEC 1989:2002 and ISO/IEC 1989:2014 standards themselves. Rows whose
> `Edition delta` is **2002→2014** (the FLAG-02 GR4 rows) are therefore marked:
> **"delta under-documented in the 2023 spec; confirm against the older standard before gating."**
> There is **no 85→2002 row set here at all** — when gating an 85↔2002 difference, derive it from the 2002 standard, not from this file. **Gap-closure plan (the four-compilers-in-one mission needs the full deltas):** for *new-feature introduction* gating at the 85/2002 and 2002/2014 boundaries, use the post-85 feature catalog in `docs/ISO2023_CONFORMANCE_PLAN.md` (M2/M3/M4) plus the version test matrix's `introducedIn` tags (`docs/VERSION_TEST_MATRIX_DESIGN.md`); for *behavior changes* across those boundaries, extending THIS ledger with 85→2002 and 2002→2014 row sets sourced from the ISO/IEC 1989:2002 and 1989:2014 standards is planned follow-on work — add the rows here (one canonical ledger, never a fork) as each delta is researched.

## How to use

When implementing or auditing a feature:

1. **Find its row(s) here** by feature name / § / category.
2. **If `Old → New behavior` shows a behavior change**, gate it by `DialectLevel` (cite
   [[feedback_four_editions_one_compiler]]): emit the older behavior when `--std` targets the older edition and
   the newer behavior at `>=` the introducing edition. Do **not** hard-code a single behavior across all dialects.
3. **New features** (`category: new-feature` / `new-reserved-word` / most `syntax-change`): enable / reserve only at
   `>=` the introducing edition. A word newly reserved in 2023 must still be usable as a user-defined word when the
   target is an older dialect. **Co-equal G1 obligation:** in every edition that LACKS the feature, the compiler must
   emit a **specific diagnostic** naming the construct and the edition that introduces it (e.g. "DELETE FILE requires
   --std 2023 or later") — never a generic parse error, never a silent mis-parse. The wrong-edition diagnostic ships
   in the SAME change set as the feature itself.
4. **Obsolete / archaic** (`category: obsolete` / `archaic`): flag in the dialect where the spec designates it
   archaic/obsolete; where the spec documents removal by a later edition, **reject the element at `>=` that edition
   with a specific diagnostic** naming the construct and the edition that removed it, per the row's note — accepting a
   removed construct silently, or rejecting it with a generic parse error, fails G1's co-equal diagnostic obligation.
5. **Pin-to-spec ONLY where a difference is a version-INVARIANT legacy bug** — i.e., the legacy oracle is wrong in
   *every* edition, so the spec behavior is correct for all dialects and no gating is needed. **Record that
   determination** (DEVLOG + flip Status here to `done (pin-to-spec)`). Do not pin-to-spec to dodge a genuine
   edition-dependent change; that must be gated.

**Status is DERIVED, not hand-ticked (rearch P3.6).** The per-row `Status` column was removed. Each change row now
carries a machine-readable **anchor** in its `Compiler gating action` cell:
- `<!-- gate:CONSTRUCT-ID -->` — the row is gated by that `tests/version-matrix/constructs.json` row (one or more);
- `<!-- pin-to-spec -->` — a version-INVARIANT legacy bug pinned to the spec for all dialects (not gated);
- `<!-- ref-only -->` — a clarification / no-gate-obligation row;
- `<!-- todo -->` — a genuine gate obligation not yet a `constructs.json` row.

The **Gating status index** below is GENERATED from those anchors + the catalogue's per-construct `status`
(`active`→`done` / `pending`→`pending` — itself fixture-gated by `VersionMatrixTests`, so `active` means the
construct's (construct × edition) cells actually pass). Regenerate: `pwsh scripts/gen-vcr.ps1`. `VcrDriftTests` fails
CI if the index drifts from the anchors+catalogue, if an anchor names a construct that doesn't exist, or if a cited
`§` doesn't resolve in the spec (unknown clause, or an appendix fragment that is no longer inside the clause it
names), or if a spec LINE number reappears anywhere in this file — so the ledger can no longer go stale.

> **The two pin-to-spec determinations** (version-INVARIANT legacy bugs; the legacy oracle was non-conformant in
> every edition, so they are pinned to the spec for **all** dialects rather than gated). They carry the
> `<!-- pin-to-spec -->` anchor in Table 6 (rows 130a/b): **DISPLAY trailing-trim** (§14.9.11.4) ·
> **signed-vs-alphanumeric comparison de-sign** (§8.8.4.2.5). They are not edition-change rows; they record "where we
> deliberately did NOT gate, and why." (A former row 130c "signed → group de-sign" was RETRACTED — see the CA28 note
> in Table 6: a MOVE to a GROUP receiver is non-elementary, so §14.9.25.4 GR4 PRESERVES the overpunch sign; the legacy
> was correct and there is no divergence to pin.)

## Gating status index (generated)

> **GENERATED — do not hand-edit.** Regenerate: `pwsh scripts/gen-vcr.ps1` (renders from `constructs.json` + the VCR
> `<!-- gate:id -->` anchors; `VcrDriftTests` guards it). One row per VCR-anchored construct with its derived status.
> Constructs not yet narrated in a VCR row live only in `constructs.json` — the VCR does not yet carry the full
> 85→2002 / 2002→2014 row sets (see the scope limit above); they enter as Step 5 backfills each delta.

## Table 1 — 2014 → 2023, Annex E.2 (substantive changes potentially affecting existing programs)

| # | Change (title) | § | Edition delta | Old → New behavior | Affects existing? | Compiler gating action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Item 1a — Removal: MOVE of alphanumeric figurative constants to numeric/numeric-edited items | MOVE statement; figurative constants (E.2 item 1, bullet 1) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** moving alphanumeric figurative constants (SPACE, HIGH-VALUE, LOW-VALUE, QUOTE) to numeric / numeric-edited items was permitted (not even flagged obsolete in 2014). **New:** removed from the standard. Exception still permitted: ALL "literal" of digits only, or ALL symbolic-character representing a digit, → integer numeric items. Implementors may keep the rest as an unsupported extension. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect (permit pre-2023; reject at 2023, keep the digit-only ALL exception) <!-- gate:move-alphanumeric-figurative-removed-2023 --> |
| 2 | Item 1b — Removal: Continuation of COBOL words in fixed-form reference format | Reference format / fixed form (E.2 item 1, bullet 2) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** a COBOL word could be continued across lines in fixed-form. **New:** removed (little used / error-prone); implementor extension only. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- gate:fixed-form-word-continuation-removed-2023 --> |
| 3 | Item 1c — Removal: ON OVERFLOW phrase of the CALL statement | CALL … ON OVERFLOW (E.2 item 1, bullet 3) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** CALL supported ON OVERFLOW. **New:** removed (ON EXCEPTION gives the same result); extension only. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect (accept ON OVERFLOW pre-2023) <!-- todo --> |
| 4 | Item 1d — Removal: non-pseudo-text operands in the REPLACING phrase of COPY | COPY … REPLACING (E.2 item 1, bullet 4) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** COPY … REPLACING accepted non-pseudo-text operands (identifiers, literals, words). **New:** removed; extension only. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- gate:copy-replacing-non-pseudo-text-removed-2023 --> |
| 5 | Item 1e — Removal: EXIT METHOD statement | EXIT METHOD (E.2 item 1, bullet 5) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** EXIT METHOD was valid (return from a method). **New:** removed; extension only. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- gate:exit-method-window --> |
| 6 | Item 1f — Removal: EXIT FUNCTION statement | EXIT FUNCTION (E.2 item 1, bullet 6) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** EXIT FUNCTION was valid (return from a UDF). **New:** removed; extension only. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- gate:exit-function-window --> |
| 7 | Item 1g — Removal: WITH LOCK phrase of CLOSE and the related File Status 38 | CLOSE … WITH LOCK; File Status 38 (E.2 item 1, bullet 7) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** CLOSE … WITH LOCK permitted; OPEN of a file closed WITH LOCK → File Status 38. **New:** both removed; extension only. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- gate:close-with-lock-removed-2023 --> |
| 8 | Item 2 — ALIGN clause added to consistency rules; strong-typing now includes bit-item alignment | ALIGN clause; typed-item consistency (E.2 item 2) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** ALIGN not in the typed-item consistency lists; strong-typing required byte-boundary alignment but not bit-position alignment of corresponding bit items. **New:** ALIGN added to the consistency lists; strong-typing now also requires bit-position alignment of corresponding bit items. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 9 | Item 3 — Boolean shifting operators B-SHIFT-L / B-SHIFT-R / B-SHIFT-LC / B-SHIFT-RC | Boolean operators (E.2 item 3) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** no standard boolean left/right shift operators. **New:** adds B-SHIFT-L, B-SHIFT-R (logical) and B-SHIFT-LC, B-SHIFT-RC (circular) over boolean digits of an alphanumeric/national item (also new reserved words — item 25). | Yes | new-feature-gate (enable at ≥2023) <!-- todo --> |
| 10 | Item 4 — Characters permitted in user-defined words changed | User-defined words / allowed chars (ISO/IEC 10646) (E.2 item 4) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** 037A GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI allowed; 30FB KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT allowed as first/last char. **New:** 037A deleted entirely; 30FB no longer allowed as start/last char (medial only). | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 11 | Item 5 — New compiler-directive words added | Compiler directives (E.2 item 5) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** these words were compilation-variable names; the directives did not exist. **New:** nine directive words added — COBOL-WORDS, DISPLAY, FLAG-14, I-O-STATUS-04, NUM-ED-ZERO-FIG-CONSTANT, POP, PUSH, REF-MOD-ZERO-LENGTH, UPON. (Gate links: REF-MOD-ZERO-LENGTH↔item 23, NUM-ED-ZERO-FIG-CONSTANT↔item 28, I-O-STATUS-04↔item 15.) Six of the nine words head a directive and each is now a gated row; I-O-STATUS-04 and NUM-ED-ZERO-FIG-CONSTANT are FLAG-14 OPTIONS and UPON is §7.3.12's own required word, so the nine words map to six directives plus three phrase words — a roster check must not expect nine rows (kb/Work PB725). | Yes | new-feature-gate <!-- gate:cobol-words-directive-2023 --> <!-- gate:display-directive-2023 --> <!-- gate:flag-14-directive-2023 --> <!-- gate:pop-directive-2023 --> <!-- gate:push-directive-2023 --> <!-- gate:ref-mod-zero-length-2023 --> |
| 12 | Item 6 — Compile-time arithmetic expression mode now implementor-defined | Compile-time arithmetic; intermediate results (E.2 item 6) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** the previous standard required a specific arithmetic mode (the now-removed Standard Arithmetic). **New:** the mode and intermediate-result handling are explicitly implementor-defined. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 13 | Item 7 — Leap-year determination: reference to obsolete ISO 8601 formula removed | Leap-year determination (ISO 8601-1:2019) (E.2 item 7) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** referenced ISO 8601:2004's leap-year formula. **New:** ISO 8601-1:2019 removed the formula from normative text; COBOL no longer cites the obsolete version. | No | none <!-- ref-only --> |
| 14 | Item 8 — EVALUATE compiler directive: combined-condition truth corrected | EVALUATE compiler directive (E.2 item 8) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** rules about omitting end-of-directive text (no WHEN true, no WHEN OTHER) could make the whole condition true incorrectly. **New:** the whole condition is true only when both constituent conditions are true. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 15 | Item 9 — External items: exception conditions added for conformance checking | External items / conformance checking (E.2 item 9) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** conformance rules existed but no exception conditions; checking unspecified, left to implementor. **New:** exception conditions provided; effective only when enabled in BOTH invoked and invoking runtime elements; prior implementor-defined checking now ignored unless invoked via implementor-defined syntax. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 16 | Item 10 — External items: CONSTANT RECORD now only for strongly typed external items | External items; CONSTANT RECORD (E.2 item 10) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** CONSTANT RECORD allowed on external items, but external items couldn't be strongly typed; weak checking let the "constant" record be changed by elements not specifying CONSTANT RECORD. **New:** CONSTANT RECORD allowed ONLY for strongly typed external items (external items can now be strongly typed). | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 17 | Item 11 — Figurative constant with ALL where data-item length is unspecified: length now defined | Figurative constants with ALL (unspecified length) (E.2 item 11) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** undefined results (likely a compiler error). **New:** the length is now defined → well-defined results. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 18 | Item 12 — FILE STATUS and the EXTERNAL clause: consistent FILE STATUS item required | FILE STATUS; EXTERNAL; SELECT (E.2 item 12) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** an external file's FILE STATUS in one SELECT didn't force every corresponding SELECT to specify FILE STATUS (same external item). **New:** all corresponding SELECTs must specify FILE STATUS with the same corresponding external data item. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 19 | Item 13 — FUNCTION ALL INTRINSIC: new intrinsic functions prohibited as user-defined words | REPOSITORY; FUNCTION ALL INTRINSIC (E.2 item 13) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** these seven names could be user-defined words in a FUNCTION ALL INTRINSIC scope; the functions didn't exist. **New:** adds BASECONVERT, CONCAT, CONVERT, FIND-STRING, MODULE-NAME, SMALLEST-ALGEBRAIC, SUBSTITUTE; under FUNCTION ALL INTRINSIC they are prohibited as user-defined words in that REPOSITORY scope. | Yes | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 20 | Item 14 — General case mappings deleted | General case mappings (ISO/IEC 10646) (E.2 item 14) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** mappings (0131,0069) and (03C2,03C3) treated DOTLESS I and GREEK FINAL SIGMA as having uppercase mappings (error — both are lowercase). **New:** both mappings deleted; affects UPPER-CASE / LOWER-CASE for those chars. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 21 | Item 15 — I-O Status '04' setting clarified | I-O status '04' (E.2 item 15) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** the setting of '04' was not clearly defined (a known error). **New:** clarified when '04' is set (gateable via the I-O-STATUS-04 directive, item 5). | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 22 | Item 16 — I-O Status '07' now restricted to OPEN and CLOSE | I-O status '07'; OPEN/CLOSE (E.2 item 16) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** '07' could be set by I-O statements other than OPEN/CLOSE. **New:** '07' restricted to OPEN and CLOSE. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 23 | Item 17 — I-O status '0x': case equivalence of letters now implementor-dependent | I-O status '0x' (E.2 item 17) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** upper/lower-case equivalence undefined in this context. **New:** implementor-dependent (affects portability). | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 24 | Item 18 — I-O Status '37' may be returned for insufficient authority on OPEN | I-O status '37'; OPEN (E.2 item 18) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** no standard status for OPEN with insufficient authority. **New:** OPEN may return '37' for insufficient authority. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 25 | Item 19a — INVALID KEY processing: declarative now executed when phrase absent | INVALID KEY; USE declaratives (E.2 item 19a) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** no INVALID KEY phrase + invalid-key condition → INPUT/OUTPUT/I-O/EXTEND declarative NOT executed (apparent error). **New:** such a declarative is now executed. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 26 | Item 19b — READ processing: declarative now executed for non-invalid-key/non-at-end exceptions | READ; USE declaratives (E.2 item 19b) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** READ exception that is not invalid-key/at-end → INPUT/I-O declarative NOT executed (apparent error). **New:** such a declarative is now executed (part of the inline-exception-checking PERFORM enhancement). | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 27 | Item 20 — MERGE statement restriction in output/SORT procedures | MERGE; output procedure; file-format SORT (E.2 item 20) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** a MERGE could appear in another MERGE's output procedure or a file-format SORT's input/output procedure; rules conflicted (exception or undefined). **New:** MERGE prohibited in another MERGE's output procedure or in a file-format SORT input/output procedure. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 28 | Item 21 — Obsolete elements removed | FLAG-85, FLAG-NATIVE-ARITHMETIC, Standard Arithmetic, MOVE QUOTE→numeric (E.2 item 21) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** all four were obsolete-but-present in 2014. **New:** all four removed; implementors may provide corresponding extensions. | Yes | flag-obsolete (reject at 2023; permit pre-2023) <!-- gate:move-quote-numeric-obsolete-2014 --> <!-- gate:arithmetic-standard-2002 --> <!-- gate:flag-85-directive-window --> <!-- gate:flag-native-arithmetic-directive-window --> |
| 29 | Item 22 — READ PREVIOUS immediately after OPEN now raises at-end | READ … PREVIOUS following OPEN (E.2 item 22) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** conflicting rule/note: rule said the first record is retrieved; note said at-end normally exists. **New:** at-end condition occurs for READ PREVIOUS following OPEN. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 30 | Item 23 — Reference-modification zero-length result now controlled / raises EC-BOUND-REF-MOD | Ref-mod; REF-MOD-ZERO-LENGTH; EC-BOUND-REF-MOD (E.2 item 23) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** zero-length ref-mod result undefined. **New:** zero-length ref-mod allowed only with REF-MOD-ZERO-LENGTH in effect; otherwise EC-BOUND-REF-MOD raised. (Directive from item 5.) | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 31 | Item 24 — Relative keys for an external file must be the same corresponding external data item | Relative key; external file (E.2 item 24) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** not explicitly required that the relative key be the same corresponding external item across runtime elements. **New:** required to be the same corresponding external data item in all runtime elements. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 32 | Item 25 — New reserved words added | Reserved words (E.2 item 25) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** these 16 words were user-defined words. **New:** reserved: B-SHIFT-L, B-SHIFT-LC, B-SHIFT-R, B-SHIFT-RC, COMMIT, EDITING, END-RECEIVE, END-SEND, EXCLUSIVE-OR, FINALLY, LOCATION, MESSAGE-TAG, RECEIVE, ROLLBACK, SEND, XOR.

| 33 | Item 26 — Transfer of control: checking now includes sections as well as paragraphs | Transfer of control; sections/paragraphs (E.2 item 26) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** checking of explicit/implicit transfers was unclear and did not properly include sections (only paragraphs). **New:** now includes sections as well as paragraphs. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 34 | Item 27 — VALUE clause literal categories checked for numeric-edited items | VALUE clause; numeric-edited; PIC/USAGE conformance (E.2 item 27) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** unclear what value was used for an alphanumeric/national literal VALUE on a numeric-edited item; no conformance check. **New:** such literals are checked against PICTURE/USAGE. | Yes | gate-behavior-by-dialect <!-- todo --> |
| 35 | Item 28 — VALUE clause figurative constant ZERO for numeric-edited items treated as numeric zero | VALUE; ZERO/ZEROES; numeric-edited; NUM-ED-ZERO-FIG-CONSTANT (E.2 item 28) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** ZERO/ZEROES (±ALL) as VALUE could be left-justified or a plain zero-string. **New:** treated as numeric literal zero → edited per PICTURE.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 44 | NUMVAL-C ANYCASE keyword clarified | E.3.3 item 1 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** ANYCASE of NUMVAL-C specified inconsistently. **New:** clarified to be consistent. | No | none <!-- ref-only --> |
| 45 | BEFORE and AFTER both allowed in WRITE ADVANCING | E.3.3 item 2 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** BEFORE and AFTER could not both be specified. **New:** both allowed together — `WRITE r BEFORE AFTER ADVANCING n LINES`, in either word order (§5.2.6.4). The format still prints ONE `ADVANCING` and ONE operand, so the pair is a PLACEMENT, not a second advance: §14.9.51.4 GR25 a) gives one advance and GR25 f) puts it after the presentation, exactly where a lone BEFORE puts it. §14.9.51.3 SR17 forbids PAGE with the pair (COBOLNET1910). | No | new-feature-gate <!-- gate:write-before-and-after-advancing-2023 --> |
| 46 | Binary operators B-SHIFT-L / B-SHIFT-LC / B-SHIFT-R / B-SHIFT-RC | E.3.3 item 3 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** no standard binary bit-shift operators; words not reserved. **New:** B-SHIFT-L, B-SHIFT-LC, B-SHIFT-R, B-SHIFT-RC added. | No | flag-new-reserved-word <!-- todo --> |

| 51 | Clarification that GLOBAL clause rules do not contradict EXTERNAL clause rules | E.3.3 item 8 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** apparent contradiction GLOBAL vs EXTERNAL. **New:** clarified they do not contradict. | No | none <!-- ref-only --> |
| 52 | Clarification that real zeroes are permitted when checking floating-point underflow | E.3.3 item 9 (ISO/IEC 60559:2020) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** unclear whether real zeroes were permitted values when checking underflow. **New:** clarified real zeroes are permitted per ISO/IEC 60559:2020. | No | none <!-- ref-only --> |
| 53 | Clarification of size-error rules vs ROUNDED MODE IS PROHIBITED | §14.7.5 (E.3.3 item 10) | 2014→2023 | **Old:** §14.7.5 partially self-contradicting on when rounding raises EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION. **New:** clarified — rounding raises EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION only when DEFAULT ROUNDED MODE IS PROHIBITED / ROUNDED MODE IS PROHIBITED is in effect. | No | none <!-- ref-only --> |
| 54 | COBOL words may be 63 characters long | E.3.3 item 11 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** shorter max length (31 chars in the 2002/2014 editions; 30 in COBOL-85). **New:** up to 63 chars. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |

| 57 | CONTINUE statement enhanced to pause execution for a specified time | E.3.3 item 14 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** CONTINUE was a no-op placeholder. **New:** can pause runtime execution for a specified period. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 58 | DELETE FILE statement | E.3.3 item 15 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** no standard way to remove files. **New:** DELETE FILE removes referenced files from mass storage. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 59 | DISPLAY directive | E.3.3 item 16 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** new directive. **New:** DISPLAY directive shows compile-time information during compilation. §7.3.12.1 sends it to the source listing or an implementor-defined compile-time device and lets the implementor define the stage of processing; COBOL.NET produces neither, so the directive is recognized and consumed — the GATE is the claim, not an output. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- gate:display-directive-2023 --> |
| 60 | Dynamic-length elementary items — SET to set length | E.3.3 item 17 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** no way to set the length of a dynamic-length elementary item. **New:** SET enhanced to set its length. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |

| 62 | EDITING phrase of the PICTURE clause — literal of any size | E.3.3 item 19 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** simple/sign-sensitive fixed insertion couldn't specify an arbitrary-size literal. **New:** EDITING phrase adds a literal of any size for simple and sign-sensitive fixed insertion. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 63 | EXTERNAL data items may be strongly typed | E.3.3 item 20 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** EXTERNAL items couldn't be strongly typed. **New:** they may now be strongly typed. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 64 | FLAG-14 directive | E.3.3 item 21 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** new directive. **New:** FLAG-14 flags elements possibly incompatible between the previous (2014) and this (2023) standard. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- gate:flag-14-directive-2023 --> |
| 65 | FUNCTION BASECONVERT | E.3.3 item 22 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** new intrinsic. **New:** BASECONVERT converts between number bases 2–16. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |

| 68 | FUNCTION EXCEPTION-FILE — optional file-connector argument | E.3.3 item 25 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** no argument; returned the I-O status value and file-name of the file connector (if any) associated with the last exception status. **New:** optional argument to specify the file connector for which the information is requested; original no-argument behavior unchanged when omitted. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 69 | FUNCTION EXCEPTION-FILE-N — optional file-connector argument | E.3.3 item 26 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** no argument; returned the I-O status value and file-name of the file connector (if any) associated with the last exception status (as a national character string). **New:** optional argument to specify the file connector for which the information is requested; original no-argument behavior unchanged when omitted. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 70 | FUNCTION FIND-STRING | E.3.3 item 27 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** new intrinsic. **New:** FIND-STRING locates the position of one string within another. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 71 | FUNCTION MODULE-NAME | E.3.3 item 28 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** new intrinsic. **New:** MODULE-NAME reports modules in the running application's hierarchy. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 72 | FUNCTION SMALLEST-ALGEBRAIC | E.3.3 item 29 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** new intrinsic. **New:** SMALLEST-ALGEBRAIC gives the smallest number representable in any elementary numeric item. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |

| 74 | FUNCTION TRIM enhanced to remove characters other than space | E.3.3 item 31 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** TRIM removed only leading/trailing spaces. **New:** TRIM can remove characters other than space. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 75 | GOBACK statement allows status phrase like STOP (in a main program) | E.3.3 item 32 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** GOBACK had no status phrase. **New:** GOBACK allows the STOP status phrase, effective only in a COBOL main program. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 76 | INITIALIZE clause of the OPTIONS paragraph | E.3.3 item 33 | 2023 (introduction) | **Old:** the clause did not exist; content of non-explicitly-initialized items was implementor-defined. **New (2023):** the OPTIONS INITIALIZE clause (using already-reserved words) explicitly defines that content. Annex E §E.3.3 item 33 places it among the 2014→2023 additions "not affecting existing programs" — i.e. NEW in 2023, not a semantic tightening of a pre-existing clause. | Yes (reject pre-2023) | gated 2023 <!-- gate:options-initialize-2023 --> |

| 81 | PUSH and POP directives | E.3.3 item 38 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** new directives. **New:** PUSH/POP save and restore the state of compiler directives. Note the clause pairing: §7.3.20 is POP and §7.3.22 is PUSH. The directive WORDS are gated; no compiler-directive state COBOL.NET varies is saved yet, and §7.3.20.4 GR2's unsuccessful-POP warning is unbuilt residue. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- gate:pop-directive-2023 --> <!-- gate:push-directive-2023 --> |
| 82 | RAISE statement — exception-processing clarified | E.3.3 item 39 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** RAISE exception processing specified locally. **New:** clarified to follow rules elsewhere. | No | none <!-- ref-only --> |

| 85 | SUPPRESS WHEN phrase of the ALTERNATE RECORD KEY clause | E.3.3 item 42 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** no way to suppress alternate-key access by key value. **New:** SUPPRESS WHEN suppresses access via a particular alternate key when its value equals the specified value. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 86 | VALUE clause — numeric literals permitted for numeric-edited items | E.3.3 item 43 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** numeric-edited items couldn't take a numeric-literal VALUE. **New:** numeric-edited items may be assigned numeric-literal values. | No | new-feature-gate <!-- todo --> |
| 87 | WRITE statement — impossible identifier-1 subordination condition removed (clarified) | E.3.3 item 44 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** rules implied an impossible "both subordinate and not subordinate to the FD" condition. **New:** removed. | No | none <!-- ref-only --> |
| 88 | WRITE statement — identifier-1 contents unavailable after execution (clarified) | E.3.3 item 45 | 2014→2023 | **Old:** unclear whether identifier-1 subordinate to the FD stayed available after WRITE. **New:** clarified — not available after WRITE. | No | none <!-- ref-only --> |

| 129 | VALIDATE facility (umbrella) — obsolete | §14.9.50.1 VALIDATE General; §A.4.14; §D.22.1 General (annex F.2 #5) | obsolete-in-2023 (reevaluation deferred before removal) | **Old:** a defined COBOL facility. **New:** whole VALIDATE facility flagged obsolete (no provider implemented it; no interest); reevaluated next revision before removal. | Yes | flag-obsolete <!-- todo --> |
| 130 | Implicit INTERMEDIATE ROUNDING (TRUNCATION) — unchanged across editions | §D.17.2 Intermediate rounding | unchanged across editions (explicit no-change edition reference) | **Old:** earlier editions implied INTERMEDIATE ROUNDING IS TRUNCATION when omitted. **New:** same — explicitly stated as unchanged; a deliberate no-gate edition reference. | No | none <!-- ref-only --> |
| 130a | **DISPLAY trailing-trim** — version-INVARIANT legacy bug, pinned to spec | §14.9.11.4 (DISPLAY statement) | version-invariant (legacy oracle non-conformant in every edition) | Legacy oracle behaved non-conformantly across all editions; spec behavior is correct for all dialects → **pinned to spec, not gated** (DEVLOG 509/516). | n/a (all dialects) | pin-to-spec (no gating) <!-- pin-to-spec --> |
| 130b | **signed-vs-alphanumeric comparison de-sign** — version-INVARIANT legacy bug, pinned to spec | §8.8.4.2.5 | version-invariant (legacy oracle non-conformant in every edition) | A signed numeric operand compared as alphanumeric drops its sign per §8.8.4.2.5 in every edition; legacy was wrong → **pinned to spec, not gated** (DEVLOG 509/516). | n/a (all dialects) | pin-to-spec (no gating) <!-- pin-to-spec --> |
| 130c | **signed → group move: sign PRESERVED** — RETRACTED pin (was "group de-sign") | §14.9.25.4 GR4 (MOVE, non-elementary) | version-invariant | A MOVE to a GROUP receiver is NON-elementary (GR4 ¶1), so GR4 bars internal-representation conversion and the overpunch sign is PRESERVED (S9(3) −45 → "04N"). GR6a's sign-drop applies only to a valid ELEMENTARY move (GR6). The former "de-sign" claim mis-cited GR6a and mis-applied §8.8.4.1 (a relation-condition rule) to MOVE; the legacy oracle's sign-preserving "04N" was in fact correct — no divergence, nothing to pin.

## Table 7 — PRE-2023 edition deltas (85→2002 and 2002→2014 — grown as each delta is researched and GATED)

> **Why the title is broader than "85→2002 deletions".** Tables 1–3 are the 2014→2023 window Annex E itemizes;
> Table 7 is everything the 2023 text's own annexes cannot describe because it happened earlier. It was named for
> the 85→2002 deletions because those were the only rows in it, but it never held only deletions (row 7.19 is a
> 2002 *introduction*) and, from row 7.20, no longer holds only 85→2002 rows. ⛔ Any pre-2023 delta belongs HERE —
> do not start a second table for a second window (CLAUDE.md rule 8). The repo holds no 2002 or 2014 text
> (ratified decision #1), so every row's EDITION EDGE below 2023 is DERIVED, and the derivation is stated in the
> row so it can be overturned in one line when a row proves wrong.

| # | Change | Gate | Implemented |
|---|--------|------|-------------|
| 7.1 | **DATA RECORDS clause deleted** (an obsolete element of ANSI X3.23-1985; ISO/IEC 1989:2002 removed it — the 2023 SD format §13.4.6 admits only the record clause, and the FD set likewise omits it). NIST-85 writes it on every SD/FD. | accepted-inert at `--std 85`; rejected ≥2002 | FD **and** SD: `data-records-removed-2002` (EditionValidator.VisitDataRecordsClause — ONE grammar rule, one site; the DataBinder SD-only gate MIGRATED there, P2.6/DEVLOG 589). Pinned COBOLNET0873. |
| 7.2 | **ALTER + target-less GO TO deleted** (obsolete in '85, removed by 2002 — see Table 4 context). | accepted at 85; rejected ≥2002 | COBOLNET0810/0811 (DEVLOG 543). |
| 7.4 | **LABEL RECORDS clause deleted** (obsolete '85 FD element; the 2023 FD clause set §13.18 has no LABEL clause). Every NIST FD writes it (243/459 programs). | accepted-inert at 85; rejected strict / warned permissive ≥2002 | `label-records-removed-2002`, COBOLNET0902 (the FIRST removal gate, shipped with the P2.7 permissive flip; DEVLOG 588). |
| 7.5 | **VALUE OF clause deleted** (obsolete '85 label-field clause). | accepted-inert at 85; rejected ≥2002 | `value-of-removed-2002`, 0902 (P2.6, DEVLOG 589). |
| 7.6 | **MULTIPLE FILE [TAPE] clause deleted** (I-O-CONTROL reel-sharing description). | accepted-inert at 85; rejected ≥2002 | `multiple-file-tape-removed-2002`, 0902 (P2.6, DEVLOG 589). |
| 7.7 | **MEMORY SIZE clause deleted** (OBJECT-COMPUTER). | accepted-inert at 85; rejected ≥2002 | `memory-size-removed-2002`, 0902 (token-scan of the computerAttributes sink; P2.6, DEVLOG 589). |
| 7.8 | **SEGMENT-LIMIT clause deleted** (segmentation deleted by 2002). | accepted-inert at 85; rejected ≥2002 | `segment-limit-removed-2002`, 0902 (P2.6, DEVLOG 589). |
| 7.9 | **WITH DEBUGGING MODE deleted** (SOURCE-COMPUTER; the '85 debug facility). | accepted at 85; rejected ≥2002 | `debugging-mode-removed-2002`, 0902 (P2.6, DEVLOG 589). |
| 7.10 | **Identification comment paragraphs deleted** (AUTHOR / INSTALLATION / DATE-WRITTEN / DATE-COMPILED / SECURITY; obsolete '85 elements) + **REMARKS** ('74 carryover accepted at 85 for CCVS). | accepted at 85; rejected ≥2002 | `identification-comments-removed-2002` (one row, paragraph named per site) + `remarks-removed-2002`, 0902 (P2.6, DEVLOG 589). |
| 7.11 | **STOP literal deleted** (X3.23-1985 Format 2 — communicate to the operator, then continue; §14.9.42 of 2002+ has no literal form). | 85 semantics IMPLEMENTED (BoundStopLiteral — the DEVLOG-578 silent bind-as-STOP-RUN mis-bind fixed); rejected ≥2002 | `stop-literal-removed-2002`, 0902 (P2.6, DEVLOG 589). |
| 7.12 | **OPEN … REVERSED deleted** (obsolete '85 tape phrase; NO REWIND survives into 2023 §14.9.27, whose general format still writes `{ file-name-1 [ WITH NO REWIND ] } …`). | accepted at 85; rejected ≥2002 | `open-reversed-removed-2002`, 0902 (P2.6, DEVLOG 589). The surviving NO REWIND phrase is edition-INVARIANT and ungated: `2023/pb317_open_no_rewind` + `85/pb317_open_no_rewind_85` pin the same '07' at both ends of the range, and the SR5/SR6 negatives reject at all four (kb/Work PB317). *(This row cited §14.9.26 — the MULTIPLY statement — until 2026-09-05.)* |
| 7.13 | ⚠ RESEARCH: **multi-character ALL literal associated with a numeric/numeric-edited item** — §8.3.3.6.3 SR3 prohibits it in 2023; possibly an '85-obsolete element deleted by 2002 (no in-repo evidence beyond the 2023 SR text). Currently rides the 2023 removal row (under-strict at 2002/2014, provisional). | TBD: reject ≥2002 if the 2002 deletion is confirmed | W2 track A note (DEVLOG 593); today via `move-alphanumeric-figurative-removed-2023` @2023. |
| 7.14 | KNOWN MISBIND (adversarial review, DEVLOG 595): a **trailing `,` clause separator after a PICTURE string** (`77 X PIC 99, VALUE 3.` — §8.3.5 rule 2 makes `,`-followed-by-space a separator; §13.18.40.3 SR7 forbids a trailing `,` symbol unless PICTURE is the last clause) is over-captured by the greedy `PIC_STRING` lexer rule and silently classifies numeric-edited "99," — CONFORMING source, wrong shape, every edition; the legacy classifier shares the bug. The `;` twin was fixed at the Analyze funnel (single-strip); `,` needs clause-position context the funnel lacks. | the lexer-mode cure LANDED (W3, DEVLOG 596): PIC_STRING trims a trailing `,`/`;` ONLY when LA(1) is whitespace/EOF — the §8.3.5 r2 separator shape — so NC125A's legal SR7 `…9,.` mask keeps its `,` | **FIXED (W3, DEVLOG 596)**; the Analyze single-`;`-strip stays as defense-in-depth. |
| 7.15 | **RERUN clause deleted** (I-O-CONTROL checkpoint hint: `RERUN [ON {file-name\|implementor-name}] EVERY {[END OF] {REEL\|UNIT} OF f \| n RECORDS [OF f] \| n CLOCK-UNITS \| condition-name}`; a null rerun facility is conforming — the clause has no program-visible effect). ZERO CCVS usage (not even in `newcob.val`) — spec-driven only. | accepted-inert at 85 (parsed-and-ignored, the MULTIPLE FILE posture); rejected ≥2002 | `rerun-removed-2002`, 0902 (the W3 notInGrammar batch, DEVLOG 599). Citation: §8.9 ABSENCE — the reserved-word list runs REPOSITORY → RESERVE with no RERUN — + whole-2023-text absence (no Annex E note exists — the deletion predates its 2014→2023 scope). |
| 7.16 | **ENTER statement deleted** (X3.23-1985 Nucleus `ENTER language-name [routine-name]` — other-language entry; comment-equivalent when only COBOL is supported). The operands are SYSTEM-names, deliberately NOT `cobolWord` in the grammar: `ENTER COBOL.` is the conforming switch-back and COBOL is an '85 §8.9 reserved word (a cobolWord slot would false-0901 it). ZERO active CCVS usage (comments/literals only). | accepted-inert at 85 (BoundNop); rejected ≥2002 | `enter-removed-2002`, 0902 (W3, DEVLOG 599). Citation: §8.9 absence — the list runs END-WRITE → ENVIRONMENT with no ENTER. |
| 7.17 | **USE FOR DEBUGGING deleted** (the '85 debug facility's declarative; the whole facility — WITH DEBUGGING MODE [row 7.9], debug-lines [col-7 D, already comment-stripped by the reference-format processor], DEBUG-ITEM registers — left in 2002). '85-inert posture: WITHOUT the switch the debugging section is compiled **as if comment lines** (binder + validator both skip the body — DB103M is the corpus witness: 95 register references, must compile); WITH the switch it is compiled but the implementor-defined object-time switch is permanently OFF (never triggered; DB301M–305M compile). A DEBUG-* register reference under the switch diagnoses **0899 not-implemented** (the deferred facility — DB101A), never a false 0901. ⚠ Documented leniencies: the full register/trigger facility is deferred with the golden-less DB series; binder-side switch detection is per-unit (nested programs inherit it validator-side only). | accepted-inert at 85 per the '85 rules; rejected ≥2002 | `use-for-debugging-removed-2002`, 0902 (W3, DEVLOG 599). Citation: §8.9 absence — the list runs DE → DECIMAL-POINT with no DEBUG-ITEM (the DEBUG-* family gone wholesale). |
| 7.18 | **Section-header segment-numbers deleted** (the '85 Segmentation module: `section-name SECTION [0–99].`; 0–49 fixed, 50–99 independent; the SEGMENT-LIMIT companion is row 7.8). All-resident is conforming (the '85 guarantee: a segmented program's logic flow equals its unsegmented equivalent). ⚠ Documented leniency: the independent-segment special rules (ALTERed-GO-TO reversion on re-entry, PERFORM-range/ALTER-reference restrictions, SORT/MERGE restrictions) are deliberately NOT implemented — ALTER is itself gated (row 7.2) and obsolete-at-85; the SG programs verifying reversion (SG201A: "SEGMENT-LIMIT FEATURE IS TESTED BY USE OF ALTER") are golden-less residue. | accepted-inert at 85 (number parsed and discarded, both sectionDefinition and declarativeSection); rejected ≥2002 | `segment-numbers-removed-2002`, 0902 (W3, DEVLOG 599). Citation: 'segment' absent from the whole 2023 text; §8.9 absence — the list runs SECTION → SELECT with no SEGMENT-LIMIT. |
| 7.19 | **Cultural ordering introduced — the SPECIAL-NAMES ORDER TABLE clause and FUNCTION STANDARD-COMPARE** (§12.3.7.2's last clause `ORDER TABLE ordering-name-1 IS literal-9`, with §12.3.7.3 SR9/SR10/SR11 and §12.3.7.4 GR17; §15.85). An introduction, not a deletion. ⚠ **THE EDITION EDGE IS DERIVED, NOT QUOTED, AND THE DERIVATION IS STATED SO IT CAN BE OVERTURNED.** The 2023 text carries no introduction record for either: Annex E covers only 2014→2023 and lists neither, §8.11 lists intrinsic NAMES without edition data, and the repo holds no 2002 or 2014 text (ratified decision #1 — no further standards acquisition). What IS in the repo: ORDER is reserved from 2002 and not at 85 (`reserved-words.json`, provenance "added 2002 (GnuCOBOL 2002 list; ISO 2023 §8.9)"), so the clause cannot be written at COBOL-85 — an `ORDER TABLE …` entry there is an implementor switch-name entry — and the function is inoperable without it (§15.85.3 r5 sources ordering-name-1 from that clause alone; §12.3.7.3 SR9 confines the name to that function). 2002 is therefore the earliest edition at which either can exist. Provisional to the same degree as the neighbouring locale-function windows. | rejected below 2002: the clause `order-table-2002` → COBOLNET0900 on recognition, the function `standard-compare-2002` → COBOLNET1502 by name+edition (the D8 catalog window) | LANDED (kb/Work PB101 T7): grammar `orderTableClause` + `orderTableAhead()`, `DataBinder.OrderTableBind`, `IntrinsicBinder.BindStandardCompare`, `CobolIntrinsics.StandardCompare` over the derived CLDR/UCA collation engine. Support IS claimed under Annex A.3 item 25 — CONFORMANCE.md §2 row 25 / §4 item 5. |
| 7.20 | **PADDING CHARACTER clause deleted — a 2002→2014 deletion, the first row of that window** (`PADDING [CHARACTER] IS {data-name-1 \| literal-1}` in the file control entry; the ANSI X3.23-1985 Sequential I-O block-fill character). The 2023 file control entry's clauses are §12.4.5.4–§12.4.5.15 and none is PADDING; the word occurs NOWHERE in the 2023 text, §8.9 included (its list runs PACKED-DECIMAL → PAGE). ⚠ **THE EDITION EDGE IS DERIVED, NOT QUOTED** (row 7.19's discipline): the repo holds no 2002 or 2014 text, and the only per-edition datum is `reserved-words.json`, which keeps PADDING reserved at 2002 and NOT at 2014. A clause whose leading word is not reserved cannot be written, so the clause is gone **by** 2014; and setting `removedIn` where `reservedHere()` stops reserving the word is what keeps this row and the user-word row below from contradicting each other (the SEGMENT-LIMIT shape — a word still reserved at an edition its only construct no longer has — is exactly what this avoids). If the 2002/2014 text is ever acquired and shows an earlier deletion, or shows a 2002 OBSOLETE designation, shift `removedIn` / add `obsoleteIn` on the registry row — one drift-locked line. Deleting the grammar rule instead was MEASURED and rejected: NIST SQ216A writes `PADDING CHARACTER IS "9"` and SQ217A the bare data-name form. | accepted-inert at 85/2002 (parsed-and-ignored — COBOL.NET has no blocking model, the MULTIPLE FILE / RERUN posture); rejected strict / warned permissive ≥2014 | `padding-character-removed-2014`, COBOLNET0902 (VersionConformancePass ParseArm.VisitPaddingCharacterClause; kb/Work PB300) <!-- gate:padding-character-removed-2014 --> |
| 7.20a | **PADDING became a user-defined word at 2014** — the same §8.9 interval read from the other side, and the half a clause-only gate would have missed: because PADDING is a lexer token, `01 PADDING PIC X.` was a raw COBOL0001 parse error at EVERY edition, including the two where §8.9 does not reserve the word. The word is now covered by the DERIVED reservation gate (kb/Work PB693 — every `tests/version-matrix/cobol-words.json` `nameSlot` row that §8.9 reserves at some edition, computed by `gen-cobol-words.ps1` step 4b; the hand-set flag is gone), so `cobolWord` admits it exactly where §8.9 leaves it free (2014/2023) and the generated `reservedGatedWord` alternative keeps a DECLARATION parseable at 85/2002 so the funnel answers COBOLNET0901 by name. Declining or deleting a clause may not cost the user the WORD. | accepted at 2014/2023; COBOLNET0901 at 85/2002 (an error on both axes — no conforming 85/2002 program can contain one, so there is nothing to migrate) | `user-word-padding-2014`, COBOLNET0901 (kb/Work PB300; the CRT/CURSOR precedent, kb/Work PB301) <!-- gate:user-word-padding-2014 --> |
| 7.21 | **The whole §7.3 COMPILER-DIRECTIVE FACILITY introduced** — COBOL-85 has no compiler directives at all, so a `>>` line cannot occur in a conforming COBOL-85 source, and every §7.3 directive word is therefore an introduction gate at 85. ⚠ **THE EDITION EDGE IS DERIVED, NOT QUOTED** (rows 7.19/7.20's discipline; the repo holds no 2002 or 2014 text, ratified decision #1): the derivation is (a) the M2 post-85 feature catalog in `docs/ISO2023_CONFORMANCE_PLAN.md`, which places `*>` inline comments, `>>SOURCE FORMAT`, conditional compilation and "recognize-and-ignore of the other standard `>>` directives" in COBOL-2002, (b) the already-landed `leap-second-directive-2002` row on the same derivation (kb/Work PB65), and (c) Annex E, which itemizes the 2014→2023 delta and lists none of them, so they predate 2023. The 2002-vs-2014 split WITHIN that bucket is NOT separately derivable in-repo and is stated here so it can be overturned in one line. Ten directives ride this row: `>>CALL-CONVENTION` (§7.3.9), `>>DEFINE` (§7.3.11), `>>EVALUATE`/`>>WHEN`/`>>END-EVALUATE` (§7.3.13), `>>IF`/`>>ELSE`/`>>END-IF` (§7.3.16), `>>LEAP-SECOND` (§7.3.17), `>>LISTING` (§7.3.18), `>>PAGE` (§7.3.19), `>>PROPAGATE` (§7.3.21), `>>SOURCE FORMAT` (§7.3.24) and `>>TURN` (§7.3.25). | rejected below 2002 with COBOLNET0900 — the ONE introduction band the whole family shares | LANDED (kb/Work PB725): the roster is the `directiveWords` column of `constructs.json`, inverted by `CompilerDirectiveCatalog` and gated once, at the point `ConditionalCompilationProcessor` recognizes a `>>` word. `>>SOURCE FORMAT` gates one stage earlier (`ReferenceFormatProcessor` consumes its line first). The bespoke COBOLNET0875 (`>>TURN`) is RETIRED and COBOLNET0883 (`>>PROPAGATE`) keeps only its malformed-operand half. `CompilerDirectiveCatalogDriftTests` re-derives the roster from §7.3 itself. |
| 7.3 | **CURRENCY SIGN ... WITH PICTURE SYMBOL introduced** (ISO/IEC 1989:2002 §12.3.7 separates the currency STRING from the PICTURE symbol; ANSI X3.23-1985 had only the bare single-character form — an introduction, not a deletion). | rejected at `--std 85` with a specific diagnostic; accepted ≥2002 | COBOLNET0893 (DataBinder.SwitchBindCurrency, DEVLOG 558); matrix row `currency-picture-symbol-2002`. Multi-character currency STRINGS stay rejected everywhere (COBOLNET0896 — the M2-deferred size-changing surface). |

## Appendix — spec citations (for jump-to-spec)

Each catalogued change carries the CLAUSE that documents it plus a VERBATIM FRAGMENT of the sentence the row was
written from, so a reader jumps straight to `specs/ISO_COBOL.md` and lands on the sentence, not merely on the
clause. Listed by row #.

⛔ **A LINE NUMBER IS NOT A CITATION.** This table used to carry `specLines` into the transcription. Every one of
them dangled the moment the transcription was repaired, figures were regenerated and pages were removed: ~180
references reaching line 50,407 in a file that now has 47,195 lines, all of them silently pointing at the wrong
sentence long before they pointed past the end. A clause number is the STANDARD's own identifier and does not
move; the quoted fragment is what pins the reference INSIDE the clause. Both halves are checked mechanically —
`VcrDriftTests.EverySpecCitation_ResolvesInTheSpec` applies the same contract as
`python scripts/spec/cite.py --check <clause> "<text>"`, so a citation cannot rot without the battery going red.

Annex E is the 2014→2023 substantive-changes list, Annex F the archaic/obsolete lists; a body clause beside them
is the site the change actually lands on.
