# COBOL.NET — Conformance & Processor-Dependent Element Disposition

> **STATUS: LIVE conformance record (ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §4.2.16).** This document is the implementor's user
> documentation required by §4.2.6 (processor-dependent elements), §4.2.7 (optional elements), and §4.2.13
> (obsolete elements): it states, for every processor-dependent language element in Annex A.3 and every optional

## 1. Conformance summary (§4.2.16)

COBOL.NET is a **standard-conforming** COBOL implementation targeting ISO/IEC 1989:2023, with correct support for
the 1985, 2002, and 2014 editions selected by `--std`. It implements the required nucleus and the standard modules
except the optional/processor-dependent facilities listed as **not supported** below. Per §4.2.6, an
implementation need not implement processor-dependent elements for which support is not claimed; per §4.2.7, an
optional element is implemented only when support is claimed. The four **documented non-support facilities**
(§2.4) are recognized enough to emit a named §4.2.6/§4.2.13 warning rather than a bare syntax error.

## 2. Annex A.3 — processor-dependent language element disposition

Each row is one A.3 item. **Claimed** = standard-conforming support is provided. **Not claimed** = not implemented
(a §4.2.6 warning is emitted where the element is syntactically detectable). **N/A** = the element is a property
of an unsupported facility.

## 3. Behavior determinations (§4.2.6 / Annex E — pinned implementor choices)

- **I-O status '0x' case equivalence** (E.2 item 17): the low-order status digit for a non-'00' successful
  completion is implementor-dependent; COBOL.NET reports the specific '0x' value (e.g. '04', '05', '07') rather
  than collapsing to '00'.
- **I-O status '04' (record-length mismatch)**: reported on a READ whose retrieved record length differs from the
  fixed record description, where detectable.
- **Case mappings (UPPER-CASE / LOWER-CASE, §15.97/§15.57)**: the .NET invariant Unicode case tables are used; the
  enumerated 2023 additions/deletions (DOTLESS I, GREEK FINAL SIGMA) are an approximation to the invariant mapping
  (a corner-case determination — the general Latin/basic repertoire matches exactly).
- **STOP RUN / GOBACK termination status (§14.9.42.4 GR5 / §14.9.18.4 GR10 — Annex A required items 192/193)**:
  the status "passed to the operating system" and the ERROR/NORMAL termination indication both map to the single
  observable available on .NET — the process exit code (`Environment.ExitCode`). The constraint on the STATUS
  operand (item 192): the integer value of `literal-1` / `identifier-1` (truncated toward zero) becomes the exit
  code; a non-integer display/national operand is interpreted numerically. The error-termination mechanism
  (item 193): when a status phrase specifies `ERROR` with **no** STATUS value, the exit code is 1; `NORMAL` (or
  no phrase) is 0. When a STATUS value is present it wins regardless of ERROR/NORMAL. A main-program GOBACK
  (§14.9.18.4 GR3) uses the same mapping; a status phrase on a GOBACK executed in a **called** program is inert
  (GR2). Programs with no status phrase leave the exit code at 0 (the abnormal-fatal case still forces item 44's
  nonzero exit).

## 4. Documented non-support facilities (§4.2.6 / §4.2.7 / §4.2.13)

The following whole facilities are **not implemented**. Each is recognized at compile time and reported with a
named COBOLNET1560-band warning (never a bare syntax error), per §4.2.6 (the warning mechanism) and §4.2.13
(obsolete optional elements):

1. **Message Control System (MCS) asynchronous messaging** (E.3.2 item 1 / A.3 item 4): `SEND`, `RECEIVE`,
   MESSAGE-TAG, the COMMUNICATION SECTION. Processor-dependent; not provided.
2. **Commit and rollback** (E.3.2 item 2 / A.3 items 6–7): `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`. No transaction manager.
3. **VALIDATE facility** (§14.9.50, §13.16–13.18, F.2 item 5): the `VALIDATE` statement, the validation clauses
   (`CLASS`/`DEFAULT`/`DESTINATION`/`INVALID`/`PRESENT WHEN`/`VARYING`), and EC-VALIDATE. An obsolete optional
   element (§4.2.13).
4. **Screen handling** (§13.9, optional §4.2.7): the SCREEN SECTION, ACCEPT/DISPLAY format-3 (screen), and the
   EC-SCREEN family. Not provided.

## 5. Maintenance

Update this document in the same change set as any change to the supported surface (a new usage, a facility
newly implemented or newly documented as non-support, an I-O status determination). The COBOLNET1560-band
warning sites are the code-side counterpart — keep the two in sync. This file is referenced by
`docs/VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE.md` (the edition-change checklist) and by `docs/DOC_INDEX.md`.
