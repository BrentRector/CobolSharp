# DESIGN — conditional-compilation directives inside COPY (merged text-manipulation driver, ISO §7.2.1)

> **STATUS: IMPLEMENTED (DEVLOG 966).** Subsystem deep-dive for merging the conditional-compilation (CC) and
> COPY text-manipulation stages so directives INSIDE copybooks are processed (ISO §7.2.1). Design SSOT; the plan
> (`COBOLNET_REARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` §0) points here. Keep current with the code (rule 4). The merged
> `ConditionalCompilationProcessor.ProcessWithCopy` driver is wired into `Frontend`; the legacy `Process`/COPY
> paths stay byte-identical. Gate: characterization 33/33 · CC/COPY unit 26/26 · CopyConditional 8/8 · the
> `cc_in_copy` golden · GnuCOBOL +2 fixes/0 regressions · legacy guard ALL GREEN · greenfield Conformance 3806/0.

## §1 The defect

ISO §7.2.1 orders the text-manipulation stage: **Step 1** incorporate COPY library text (false-path IF/EVALUATE
lines, *including* COPY'd text, may be omitted); **Step 2** process DEFINE/IF/EVALUATE + variable substitution +
PUSH/POP + COPY REPLACING, in encounter order over the expanded group; **Step 3** REPLACE; **Step 4** COBOL-WORDS.

The current greenfield pipeline (`Frontend.Preprocess`) runs **CC (Step 2a) BEFORE COPY (Step 1)** —
deliberately, so a main-source `>>IF` can gate a `COPY` statement. Consequence: a `>>DEFINE`/`>>IF`/`>>EVALUATE`
**inside a copybook** is never processed — it survives COPY expansion and reaches the lexer as a stray token
(**verified:** a copybook `>>IF` → `COBOL0001: unexpected '>'`). Steps 3/4 (REPLACE, COBOL-WORDS) and Step 2d
(COPY REPLACING) are already correctly ordered — the ONLY defect is Steps 1/2.

## §2 What must be preserved (verified firsthand)

1. A main-source `>>IF USEIT = 0` gating a `COPY` → the COPY is skipped (prints the un-copied value).
2. A **missing copybook in a false branch** must NOT error (today it works because CC blanks the false-branch
   COPY line before `CopyProcessor` runs). **This is why a simple order-swap (COPY-first) is unacceptable** —
   it would expand the false-branch COPY and raise a spurious CBL3620.
3. Legacy byte-identity: `ConditionalCompilationProcessor.Process` and `CopyProcessor.Process` keep their exact
   behavior (the frozen `CobolSharp.Compiler` oracle at `Compilation.cs:345/355` + the standalone `preprocess`
   CLI + the direct unit tests depend on them).
4. The H3 line-count-preserving discipline: the five downstream directive-collection stages
   (TURN/PROPAGATE/REF-MOD/FLAG/COBOL-WORDS) run AFTER, on the final expanded text; the `linesBefore` baseline is
   captured after the merged driver. The merged driver itself changes line counts (COPY inserts lines) — it runs
   BEFORE the baseline snapshot, exactly where CC+COPY run today.

## §3 Mechanism — one interleaved recursive driver (owner-directed)

A new greenfield class **`CopyConditionalProcessor`** fuses the CC branch-selection state machine with COPY
expansion into ONE pass with **shared directive state**, so:
- an emitting-branch `COPY` is expanded and the copybook's incorporated text is fed through the SAME pass (so
  copybook `>>DEFINE`/`>>IF`/… are processed, with the DEFINE table shared across the copybook boundary);
- an omitted-branch `COPY` is DROPPED (never expanded → constraint §2.2 holds);
- a main-source `>>IF` still gates a `COPY` (constraint §2.1) — the driver reaches the `>>IF` first and its
  false branch omits the following COPY line.

This is the spec model (Step 1 flatten ⊕ Step 2 CC, processed in encounter order over the expanded group)
realized lazily so false-path COPYs are never incorporated.

### §3.1 Shared state (`CcState`)

Extracted from the current `ConditionalCompilationProcessor.Process` locals into a per-run object threaded
through recursion: the `defines` map (DEFINE/OFF/OVERRIDE), the `>>IF`/`>>EVALUATE` frame `stack`, the
`FlagScanState` (the frontend-inline FLAG options b/c), and the shared `CompileTimeExpressionEvaluator`. One
`CcState` per compilation group; recursion into a copybook shares it (so a copybook DEFINE is visible to
following main-source directives — spec Step-2 encounter order).

### §3.2 COPY expansion reuse

The copybook mechanics stay in `CopyProcessor` (find/read, `NormalizeCopybook` fixed→free, COPY REPLACING via
`ApplyReplacements`, the circular/`MaxCopyDepth` guards). The merged driver calls a NEW `CopyProcessor` method
that expands ONE COPY statement at a given position — parse name + REPLACING (to the terminating period, possibly
multi-line), resolve, normalize, apply REPLACING — and returns the copybook text (NOT recursively expanded; the
merged driver recurses so nested COPY *and* nested CC both process). `alreadyIncluded` + `depth` thread through
for the SR1 circular / depth-20 guards.

### §3.3 The `leave*` flags + the collection stages

The driver keeps the exact `leave*` behavior: an emitting-branch `>>TURN`/`>>PROPAGATE`/`>>REF-MOD-ZERO-LENGTH`/
`>>FLAG-02`/`>>FLAG-14`/`>>COBOL-WORDS` survives to its downstream stage; an omitted-branch one drops; the FLAG
options b/c update the shared `FlagScanState`. REPLACE (Step 3) runs after the whole interleaved expansion
(`CopyProcessor.ApplyReplaceStatements` over the merged text); the five collection stages + COBOL-WORDS run
unchanged on the final text.

### §3.4 Copybook `>>SOURCE FORMAT` scoping (§7.3.24.3 GR5)

`NormalizeCopybook` already normalizes each copybook in ISOLATION (its own `>>SOURCE FORMAT` segments are
resolved within the copybook and do not leak out), so GR5's "scoped-and-reverting" is satisfied by construction.
No cross-copybook SOURCE FORMAT state is threaded.

### §3.5 The origin line map (kb/Work PB82 — landed 2026-08-18)

Every stage of the chain that CHANGES the line count is MAPPED: it takes and returns a `MappedText` (the text plus
ONE `SourceOrigin(File, Line)` per `Split('
')` piece — the invariant the constructor asserts), and its string
overload is the mapped one's `.Text` (one implementation, never two). `OriginWriter` assembles the outputs: an
output line piece takes the origin of the FIRST content written into it. The stages and their splice rules —
- the fixed→free normalizer (`ConvertFixedToFree(..., origins)`): a continuation join strips the previous output
  line's newline and REOPENS its origin, so the joined line keeps its head line's number; a discarded
  `>>SOURCE FORMAT` directive line keeps its slot;
- the CC driver's `Render(MappedText)`: an omitted or directive line keeps its own origin (a blank output line), a
  block keeps its lines', a copybook expansion the copybook's (through `RenderCopybook(MappedText, depth)`);
- `CopyProcessor.ExpandCopiesOneLevel(MappedText)`: the text before a COPY keeps its origins, the two framing
  newlines belong to the COPY statement's own line, the incorporated text carries the copybook's path and physical
  lines (`NormalizeCopybookMapped` — a fixed-form member's continuation joins are tracked exactly like the main
  source's) — and `ResolveOneCopy`, `OnNonPseudoTextOperand`, the CC `DirectiveDiag` all report at the SOURCE
  origin of the position they are looking at, never at an ordinal of the text being processed;
- `ApplyReplaceStatements(MappedText)` / `ApplyReplacements(MappedText)`: a REPLACE statement's own lines vanish
  from the resultant text; kept text keeps its origins, a replacement's text takes the origin of the line its
  match started on.

`Frontend.Preprocess` returns the final `MappedText`, publishes `Frontend.LineMap` (`SourceLineMap`: resultant
line → origin; `Locate` is the ONE conversion to a 0-based `SourceLocation`), asserts every later stage (NIST
substitution, the six directive stages) is line-count preserving, and hands the map to the parser listener
(`CobolErrorListener` — which also stopped reporting every syntax error one line late), to the directive stages'
diagnostics, and (via `CompilerDriver` → `EditionContext.LineMap`) to the binder's diagnostic cursor and
`EXCEPTION-LOCATION`. The `>>TURN` / `>>FLAG` / `>>REF-MOD-ZERO-LENGTH` event lines are compared with token lines
and therefore stay in RESULTANT space — the map is consulted only at the user-facing boundary. Consumer side:
`docs/COBOLNET_VALIDATION_DESIGN.md` §2 "Positions".

## §4 Wiring (greenfield only)

`Frontend.Preprocess`: replace the two calls `ConditionalCompilationProcessor.Process(...)` (before COPY) +
`CopyProcessor.Process(...)` with ONE `CopyConditionalProcessor.Process(text, sourceDir, copySearchPaths,
dialect, permissive, diag, sourcePath)` returning the fully expanded free-form text (COPY incorporated, CC
applied, REPLACE applied). Everything downstream (NIST, TURN/…/COBOL-WORDS, the H3 baseline) is unchanged. The
legacy `Compilation.cs` and the `preprocess` CLI keep the two separate calls — byte-identical.

## §5 Increments

- **Incr 1 — the merged driver, common case.** `CcState` extraction + `CopyConditionalProcessor` (CC
  branch-selection + emitting-branch COPY expansion + omitted-branch COPY drop + shared DEFINE state) +
  `CopyProcessor.ExpandOneCopy`. Wire into `Frontend`. Preserve §2.1/§2.2. Unit + conformance goldens (copybook
  `>>IF`, copybook `>>DEFINE` seen by main `>>IF`, main `>>IF` gating COPY, false-branch missing copybook).
- **Incr 2 — edges** (only if a probe/differential shows a gap): multi-line COPY REPLACING interleaved with CC;
  mid-line COPY; PUSH/POP across the copybook boundary; nested-copybook directives.

## §6 Gate (per the shared-core / high-blast-radius doctrine)

Wave-local per commit (build + characterization + the new unit/goldens + CLI probes). **Before merge / for the
driver-swap commit:** the FULL legacy guard (`guard.sh`/`guard-fast.sh` ALL GREEN — the legacy oracle must be
byte-identical) + the FULL greenfield Conformance + **the GnuCOBOL external differential before/after** (the
owner directive: diff per-case verdicts; a divergence→agree flip is a FIX, an agree→divergence flip is a
REGRESSION, 0 tolerated). The GnuCOBOL corpus exercises COPY heavily — it is the real net for this change.

## §7 Tests

- **Unit** `CopyConditionalProcessorTests` — copybook `>>IF` (both branches), copybook `>>DEFINE` visible to a
  later main `>>IF`, main `>>IF` gating COPY (taken/omitted), false-branch missing copybook (no error), nested
  COPY with directives, the `leave*` survival (a copybook `>>TURN` reaches the TURN stage).
- **Conformance** `tests/conformance/2023/cc_in_copy_*.cob` (+ `.out`) — an observable end-to-end (a copybook
  `>>IF` selecting a VALUE, printed) + GreenfieldOnly exclusion (the frozen legacy can't process copybook CC).
