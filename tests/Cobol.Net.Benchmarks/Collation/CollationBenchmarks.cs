/// ⚖ WHY THIS EXISTS. The engine is on the hot path of ordinary COBOL: every relation condition between two
/// alphanumeric operands under a LOCALE program collating sequence, every key comparison in <c>SORT</c> /
/// <c>MERGE</c>, every INDEXED-file key comparison, <c>MAX</c>/<c>MIN</c>, and <c>FUNCTION STANDARD-COMPARE</c>
/// all reach it (Collation/README.md §6). A <c>SORT</c> of a million records is tens of millions of calls to
/// <see cref="Collator.Compare(string?,string?)"/>, so its cost per comparison — and, just as much, its
/// ALLOCATION per comparison — is a product characteristic, not an implementation detail.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The engine deliberately does not delegate to <see cref="CompareInfo"/> (README §1: the host's ICU floats with
/// the operating system, and a decade-old INDEXED file must stay in key order). That decision is only defensible
/// if the table-driven implementation is in the same performance class as the ICU it declines to use — which is
/// why <see cref="CompareInfo"/> appears here as a baseline in every comparison category, alongside
/// <see cref="string.CompareOrdinal(string,string)"/> as the floor that no culturally-correct collation can reach.

/// collation elements level by level and normalizes only when the text holds a combining mark. A non-zero
/// Allocated column on a pure-ASCII input means something started buffering the elements, materializing a key, or
/// boxing — and a SORT would feel it as GC pressure long before it felt it as CPU.</item>

/// A case-only difference forces levels 1, 2 and 3 to be walked in full where a last-character primary difference
/// costs one walk. Much more than 3× means a level is doing redundant work; much less means a level is being
/// skipped, which would be a correctness bug the ordering tests should have caught first.</item>
/// <item><b><see cref="Compare_MixedLocaleStrings"/> jumping while the ASCII paths hold still.</b> That is the
