/// through the <c>nameof</c>-anchored <c>RuntimeApi</c> façade, so a runtime rename breaks ONE file at compile
/// time. The Step-9-final sweep (DEVLOG 810) drove every Step-9 emitter to ZERO; Step 12 routed
/// <c>IntrinsicRenderer</c> (the static-channel deletion) and deleted its entry. The remaining baselines are
/// the three expression/condition renderers, whose fragments route when the P9 <c>Roslyn/</c> consolidation
/// (ExpressionRenderer) restructures them.
/// A file NOT listed must have ZERO bare accesses; a listed file's count may only SHRINK (update the entry
/// downward, delete it at 0; when the table empties, flip this test to forbid-all).
