      *> stores into the formal parameter and the store reaches the CALLER's storage, because a BY
      *> REFERENCE argument and its formal parameter share one data item (§14.2.3). SR5's condition has
      *> two halves and both are pinned here:
      *>   · "specified"  — CALL … USING BY REFERENCE WS-REF ;
      *>   · "or IMPLIED" — CALL … USING WS-BARE, a bare argument, whose mode is BY REFERENCE by default.
      *> The contrast arm is SR4's, which classifies a BY CONTENT identifier-2 as a SENDING operand: the
      *> callee's store must NOT reach the caller.
      *>
      *> DERIVED VALUES. The callee adds 5 to its formal on every activation.
      *>   REF=0015   10 + 5 — the BY REFERENCE store reached the caller's item.
      *>   BARE=0025  20 + 5 — the IMPLIED BY REFERENCE mode did the same.
      *>   CON=0030   30 unchanged — BY CONTENT is a sending operand (SR4), so the callee wrote a
      *>              detached copy and the caller's item is untouched. Were the mode threaded wrongly
      *>              this line would read CON=0035 and the whole classification would be unwitnessed.
