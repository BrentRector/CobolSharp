      *> kb/Work PB535 - ISO 1989:2023 13.18.40.4 GR4, MEASURED AS DISPLACEMENT. "The size in boolean
      *> positions or character positions of an elementary data item that has been defined with a PICTURE
      *> clause is determined by the number of symbols in character-string-1 that represent either boolean
      *> positions or character positions." GR14 names the three symbols that represent none - 'P' ("not
      *> counted in the size of the item"), 'V' ("not counted in the size of the item") and 'S' ("counted in
      *> the size of the item only when the subject of the entry is described with a SIGN clause with the
      *> SEPARATE phrase") - and says of every other symbol "is counted in the size of the item".
      *>
      *> Each group below is filled by ONE alphanumeric group MOVE and the group's LAST member is displayed,
      *> so what the golden reads is the DISPLACEMENT the preceding item causes: an item one position short
      *> of its picture shifts every following member, which is precisely the harm PB535 recorded when the
      *> alphanumeric arm counted a whitelist of the symbols it expected instead of GR4's symbols - PIC XX,XX
      *> sized 4 where GR4 gives 5, PIC XXCR sized 2 where GR4 gives 4. GR4 is a general rule of every
      *> edition from 1985 on, so 85 is the edition to pin it at.
      *>
      *> S01 AAAA is 4 (GR5 alphabetic; four 'A', each counted), so "ABCDEF" leaves "EF".
      *> S02 XXX9 is 4 (GR6 alphanumeric - at least one 'X'; 'X' and '9' both counted).
      *> S03 A9 is 2 (GR6's other leg - two DIFFERENT symbols from 'A', 'X', '9' and no 'X' at all).
      *> S04 XX0XX is 5 and S05 XX/XX is 5 (GR7 alphanumeric-edited; GR14 counts '0' and '/' as character
      *>     positions into which the zero and the slant are inserted during editing).
      *> S06 S999 is 3, NOT 4: no SIGN SEPARATE phrase is specified, so GR14 does not count the 'S'.
      *> S07 9(3)PP is 3: GR14's 'P' is "not counted in the size of the item, but each symbol 'P' is counted
      *>     in the maximum number of digit positions".
      *> S08 9V99 is 3: GR14's 'V' is not counted either.
      *> S09 999CR is 5: GR14's '+ - CR DB' entry counts EACH CHARACTER used in the symbol, so the two
      *>     characters of 'CR' are two character positions.
      *> S10 ZZ,ZZ9.99 is 9: every symbol of a numeric-edited mask is a character position.
