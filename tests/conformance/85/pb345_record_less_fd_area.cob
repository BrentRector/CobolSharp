      *> The COBOL-85 twin of 2023/pb345_record_less_fd_area (kb/Work PB345). ISO/IEC
      *> 1989:2023 §13.4.5.3 SR3's permission to write a file description entry with NO
      *> record description entries, and §14.9.30.4 GR6's implied "alphanumeric group item
      *> of the maximum size established by the RECORD clause", carry no edition gate --
      *> docs/VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE.md records no delta for either -- so the SAME
      *> program behaves identically at --std 85. This twin exists to keep it that way:
      *> gating the record-less FD by accident would be invisible at 2023 alone.
      *> The UNLOCK legs of the 2023 twin are ABSENT here on purpose -- the UNLOCK
      *> statement is a COBOL-2002 introduction (§14.9.47), gated at bind.
      *>
      *> DERIVATION (identical to the 2023 twin, same clauses) --
      *>   OPEN=00  §9.1.13.2 item 1.
      *>   R1       the implied 20-byte area to a PIC X(20) receiver: same bytes.
      *>   R2       the implied entry is a GROUP, so §14.9.25.4 GR4 second paragraph makes
      *>            the implicit MOVE an alphanumeric-to-alphanumeric elementary move and
      *>            the leftmost 5 of "12345ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO" reach the PIC 9(5) receiver.
      *>   R3=10    §9.1.13.4 item 1 a).
      *>   RD1=47   READ on a CLOSED connector: §9.1.13.7 item 7.
      *>   OO=00 / CL=00   successful OPEN OUTPUT and CLOSE (§9.1.13.2 item 1).
      *>   RD2=23   RANDOM READ of relative record 1 of an empty file: §9.1.13.5 item 3 a).
