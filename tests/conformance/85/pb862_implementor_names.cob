      *> kb/Work PB862 + PB716 - what a SPECIAL-NAMES switch-name / feature-name / device-name entry may
      *> consist of (ISO 12.3.7.2, rendered from the printed page, PDF p320 / folio 290), at COBOL-85 where the
      *> entry was introduced.  12.3.7.3 SR8: "The implementor shall specify the names that are available for
      *> switch-name-1, feature-name-1, and device-name-1."  COBOL.NET's names are ONE table
      *> (Binding/ImplementorNames.cs; docs/CONFORMANCE.md section 7, A.1 items 189/190/191), and every entry
      *> below names a row of it in the arm its type allows:
      *>   SWITCH-3 - a switch-name with its mnemonic AND both status phrases, written OFF-first.  The status
      *>              groups sit inside CHOICE INDICATORS (5.2.6.4 - any order, each at most once); the old
      *>              grammar spelled them ON-then-OFF only and refused this line with COBOL0001.
      *>   UPSI-7   - a switch-name with a status phrase and no mnemonic (the braced second alternative).
      *>   SYSOUT / CONSOLE - device-names, used by DISPLAY UPON (12.3.7.3 SR7).
      *>   CSP / C01 - feature-names; declared and not used here (their WRITE ADVANCING rules are pinned by
      *>              FileIoDifferentialTests), because a declaration must be ACCEPTED for every row.
      *> Expected values, from the rules: the switches' initial status comes from the external facility
      *> (12.3.7.4 GR4 - COBOL.NET's is the COBOL_<SWITCH-NAME> environment variable, absent = OFF), so SW3-OFF
      *> and U7-OFF hold at entry; SET SW3 TO ON makes SW3-ON true (14.9.39.4 GR5); the CLASS test is the
      *> control that the paragraph still binds its other clauses.
