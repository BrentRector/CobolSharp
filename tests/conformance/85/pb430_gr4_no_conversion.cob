      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 14.9.25.4 GR4 - the elementary-vs-group decision and its no-conversion clause
      *> (kb/Work PB430).  GR4: "Any move in which the sending operand is either a literal or an elementary
      *> item and the receiving item is an elementary item is an elementary move." and "Any move that is not
      *> an elementary move, and does not reference a variable-length group, is treated exactly as if it were
      *> an alphanumeric to alphanumeric elementary move, except that there is no conversion of data from one
      *> form of internal representation to another."  Both sentences are measured, on BOTH operand sides.
      *> COBOL-85 is the introducing edition: every rule used here is in the 1985 standard, and the
      *> divergences this pins were silent wrong answers at all four editions.
      *>
      *> (1) A LEVEL-66 RENAMES ... THROUGH ALIAS IS A GROUP ITEM.  13.18.45.4 GR2: "When the THROUGH phrase
      *>     is specified, data-name-1 defines an alphanumeric group item that includes all elementary items
      *>     starting with data-name-2 ..."  So a MOVE from it is NOT an elementary move, and the receiver's
      *>     EDITING - which GR6 confines to valid elementary moves - does not apply: the two characters are
      *>     moved as alphanumeric to alphanumeric and space-filled on the right in the 3-position receiver.
      *>     THRU-SEND and TWIN-SEND are the same KIND of thing under GR2 and must agree.  Both [45 ].
      *> (2) THE CONTROL, 13.18.45.4 GR1: "When the THROUGH phrase is not specified, all of the data
      *>     attributes of data-name-2 become the data attributes of data-name-1" - so the alias of an
      *>     ELEMENTARY item is elementary, the move IS an elementary move, and the receiver edits: the
      *>     alphanumeric sender is treated as an unsigned integer 45 and PIC ZZ9 renders it [ 45].
      *> (3) THE SAME DECISION ON THE RECEIVING SIDE.  GR4's first sentence needs BOTH operands elementary,
      *>     so a THROUGH alias RECEIVER makes the move non-elementary too.  GR6 a) drops the operational
      *>     sign only "when an alphanumeric ... data item is a receiving operand" in a valid ELEMENTARY
      *>     move, so the group receiver keeps the DISPLAY overpunch: -123 in PIC S9(3) is 12L in this
      *>     implementation's zoned representation (docs/CONFORMANCE.md A.1 sign convention), and the alias
      *>     receiver must store exactly what the structurally-identical group receiver stores.  Both [12L  ].
      *> (4) "THERE IS NO CONVERSION OF DATA FROM ONE FORM OF INTERNAL REPRESENTATION TO ANOTHER."  A
      *>     PACKED-DECIMAL elementary item sent INTO a group must deposit the same representation bytes it
      *>     contributes when it is sent AS PART OF a group - 13.18.60.4 leaves that representation to the
      *>     implementor (docs/CONFORMANCE.md items 205-215: BCD, trailing sign nibble, 3 bytes for PIC
      *>     9(4) COMP-3), and whatever it is, the two directions of the same clause must agree.  Rendering
      *>     it as zoned DISPLAY digits is a conversion, and it also makes the item occupy 4 character
      *>     positions where its representation occupies 3.  NOCONV=AGREES.
