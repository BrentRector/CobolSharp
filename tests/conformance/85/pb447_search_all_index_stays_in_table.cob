      *> ISO §14.9.37.4 — WHERE EACH SEARCH FORMAT LEAVES ITS SEARCH
      *> INDEX. The standard writes the scan twice and the two texts
      *> disagree, so this program asserts BOTH, in one run, at the
      *> edition both formats already existed in (kb/Work PB447).
      *>
      *> A — Format 2, unsuccessful. GR9: "At no time is it set to a
      *>     value that exceeds the value that corresponds to the last
      *>     element of the table or is less than the value that
      *>     corresponds to the first element of the table." The same
      *>     rule ends "the final setting of the search index is
      *>     undefined", so the program asserts the RANGE and not a
      *>     particular occurrence — being inside the table is the
      *>     promise; which occurrence is not.
      *> B — Format 1, unsuccessful. GR4: "the search index is
      *>     incremented by one occurrence number. The process is then
      *>     repeated using the new index setting unless the new value
      *>     for the search index corresponds to a table element
      *>     outside the permissible range of occurrence values." The
      *>     new value is formed and then judged, so the index ends at
      *>     6 over five occurrences — determined, and pinned exactly.
      *> C — Format 2 over an occurs-depending table. §13.18.38 GR7
      *>     makes the CURRENT count the last element, so GR9's bound
      *>     is 3 here although storage for 5 exists.
      *> D — Format 2, successful. GR1 a): the index "remains set at
      *>     the occurrence number that caused a WHEN condition to be
      *>     satisfied"; one occurrence holds 5, so GR7's "undefined
      *>     which one" does not arise.
