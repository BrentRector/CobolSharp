      *> kb/Work PB877 - a SUBSCRIPT that is itself a SUBSCRIPTED IDENTIFIER, on every side of a statement.
      *>
      *> THE RULE. ISO/IEC 1989:2023 8.4.2.3.2 prints the `subscript` general format as exactly three
      *> alternatives - ALL, arithmetic-expression-1, and index-name-1 [ {+|-} integer-1 ] - and 8.8.1.1
      *> defines an arithmetic expression as, among other things, "an identifier referencing a numeric data
      *> item". 8.4.3.1.2 Format 2 makes that identifier a qualified-data-name-WITH-SUBSCRIPTS, and
      *> 8.4.2.3.3 SR2 says when it may carry them: the entry "shall contain an OCCURS clause OR SHALL BE
      *> SUBORDINATE TO a data description entry that contains an OCCURS clause". X below carries no OCCURS
      *> clause of its own and is subordinate to one, so X(1) is a legal identifier and therefore a legal
      *> arithmetic-expression-1 subscript. 8.4.2.3.3 SR3 fixes the COUNT - one subscript per OCCURS clause
      *> in the description of the table element - so Y (X(1)) writes exactly ONE subscript, not two.
      *>
      *> Every expected value below is computed from the rules, never from a run:
      *>   8.4.2.3.4 GR1b - the subscript is THE RESULT of evaluating arithmetic-expression-1, so with
      *>                    X(1) = 2 the reference Y (X(1)) selects occurrence 2, identically to Y (2).
      *>   14.9.25.4 GR4  - MOVE ALL "A" TO G2(1) is a group move: 12 character positions filled with "A".
      *>   14.9.20.4     - INITIALIZE with no REPLACING sets each elementary item to the value its category
      *>                    takes: a numeric item to ZERO, an alphanumeric item to SPACE.
      *>
      *> The first pair of lines is the shape of GnuCOBOL's run_initialize:298, which battery #77 caught
      *> regressing to COBOLNET0899 - INITIALIZE Y (X(1)) beside INITIALIZE Y (2) in one program.

      *>    keys 1..4 against "a".."d" and T-G(2) the same keys against "w".."z"; T-N(1) = 2 selects
