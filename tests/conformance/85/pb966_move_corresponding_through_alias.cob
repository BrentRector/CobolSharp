      *> kb/Work PB966 - MOVE CORRESPONDING THROUGH A LEVEL-66 ALIAS.
      *>
      *> 14.9.25.3 SR12: "Identifier-3 and identifier-4 shall specify group data items and shall not be
      *> reference-modified." 13.18.45.4 GR2: "When the THROUGH phrase is specified, data-name-1 defines
      *> an alphanumeric group item that includes all elementary items starting with data-name-2 ... or
      *> the first elementary item in data-name-2 (if data-name-2 is a group item), and concluding with
      *> data-name-3". So a THROUGH alias IS a group data item and SR12 admits it on either side; this
      *> program used to be refused COBOLNET1757 "described with level-number 66, so it is not a group
      *> data item". SR12 names no level number (ADD/SUBTRACT SR6 do; they still refuse it).
      *>
      *> DETERMINATION (docs/CONFORMANCE.md section 7): 14.7.6 rule 1 pairs items with "the same data-name
      *> and the same qualifiers, if any, up to, but not including, D1 and D2". An alias includes the
      *> ELEMENTARY items GR2 names and no groups, so each included item stands directly in the alias
      *> with no qualifier between: it corresponds by name with a first-level item of the other operand.
      *> Rules 4 and 5 still exclude an included item under a REDEFINES or OCCURS entry inside the window;
      *> rule 6 excludes a name the alias includes twice.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED (DST is reset to all "*" before each MOVE):
      *>   L1 - MOVE CORRESPONDING SALIAS (SG THROUGH S3) TO DST. Included: S1 N1 S2 DUP DUP S5 SR S3.
      *>        S1 "ABC"; N1 123 into 9(5) = "00123" (14.9.25.4 numeric move); S2 "DEF"; DUP is
      *>        included twice - rule 6, no pair, "*" kept; S5 lies under SRR REDEFINES SR inside the
      *>        window - rule 5, "**" kept; SR "RR"; S3 "GHI". S0 is outside the window ("**" kept) and
      *>        DST's SG is not matched because GR2 includes no group ("******" kept).
      *>   L2 - MOVE CORRESPONDING R2 TO TALIAS (T1 THRU T2): the alias is the RECEIVER. Its members are
      *>        T1, S2, S3 (T2's elementary items, unqualified). R2's S2 and S3 correspond; T1 has no
      *>        namesake and keeps "aaa". TGT = "aaa222333".
      *>   L3 - MOVE CORRESPONDING GALIAS TO DST, GALIAS RENAMES SG without THROUGH: 13.18.45.4 GR1
      *>        gives it SG's attributes, so it is SG's group and its S1 and N1 correspond.
