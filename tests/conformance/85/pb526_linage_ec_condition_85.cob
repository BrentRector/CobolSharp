      *> The COBOL-85 EDITION TWIN of
      *> tests/conformance/2023/pb526_linage_ec_condition, which carries
      *> the full derivation and every cite.py --check line.
      *>
      *> WHY THE TWIN EXISTS. §13.18.34.4 GR6 b)'s two value rules and the
      *> continuation they prescribe are VERSION-INVARIANT — no edition
      *> gate touches the LINAGE clause — but the two channels the rule
      *> reaches a program through are not equally old. The exception
      *> condition it names is the 2002 EC model's (checking is enabled by
      *> a >>TURN directive, which COBOL-85 does not have), while the I-O
      *> STATUS and the format-1 USE declarative that read it are COBOL-85
      *> constructs. §14.6.13.1.3 3) is what joins them:
      *>   python scripts/spec/cite.py --check 14.6.13.1.3 "If the
      *>   exception condition is a fatal EC-I-O exception condition, then
      *>   the rules for 9.1.13, I-O status apply, then if the implementor
      *>   has not specified otherwise, the following rules apply for all
      *>   fatal exception conditions."   -> OK  §14.6.13.1.3 3)
      *> so the whole of GR6 b) 2's observable behaviour — the '90' status
      *> (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §7 DOC-A.1-110), the declarative, the
      *> counter pinned at 0, the continuation with the statement after
      *> the WRITE, every later WRITE re-raising, and the CLOSE that ends
      *> it — is reachable from a program that uses NO construct newer
      *> than 1985. THAT is what this file asserts: compile it at
      *> `--std 85` and the answers are identical to the 2023 twin's.
      *> Without it the rule would be pinned only where the EC model
      *> exists, and a regression that made the behaviour depend on the
      *> EC subsystem being present would stay green.
      *>
      *> The expected values are the 2023 twin's, line for line, for the
      *> same reasons; see that file for each one's derivation.
