      *> kb/Work PB653 at COBOL-85 -- A NESTED FLOAT OPERAND IS NOT A TRANSFER, SO IT IS NOT QUANTIZED.
      *> PB647 made the float->fixed landing's SCALE and MODE one decision and gave a NESTED operand the
      *> >=9 float working scale with truncation. That truncates the returned value one digit too early and
      *> every operation above it propagates the loss, so ONE binary64 gave TWO answers depending only on
      *> whether it arrived as a function's returned value or out of a COMP-2 item holding the same double:
      *>   COMPUTE T9 = FUNCTION SQRT(3) * 2   gave 003.464101614
      *>   COMPUTE T9 = C2 * 2   (C2 = SQRT(3)) gave 003.464101615
      *> ISO 15.4.1 forbids the split outright -- "the returned value is the same for all instances of a
      *> given function within a single execution of the runtime element so long as the value and order of
      *> the arguments, the collating sequence, and the locale are unchanged" -- and the RELATION channel,
      *> which never quantized, already agreed with the COMP-2 item. 8.8.1.3 grants native arithmetic "an
      *> implementor-defined method of evaluating an arithmetic expression, an arithmetic statement, the SUM
      *> clause, and all integer and numeric functions", which licenses a working scale but not two working
      *> scales for one value; 14.7.4.1 puts the one truncation at the transfer -- "If, after decimal point
      *> alignment, the number of places in the fractional part of the result of an arithmetic operation is
      *> greater than the number of places provided for the fraction of the resultant identifier, truncation
      *> is relative to the size provided for the resultant identifier" -- and 14.7.4.3 rule 2 makes the
      *> no-phrase store "as if ROUNDED MODE IS TRUNCATION had been specified".
