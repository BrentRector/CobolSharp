      *>   SAME clause is available for reuse in sorting or merging any
      *>   of the other sort or merge files specified in that

      *> Derivation, by output line:
      *>  1 "C F3-ONE F4-ONE": F3 and F4 are both in the SORT clause and
      *>    both open OUTPUT; GR4 c) says their areas are NOT shared,
      *>    so after MOVE F3-ONE / MOVE F4-ONE each area keeps its own
      *>    value (a shared area would show F4-ONE twice).
      *>  2-4 "S1 A".."S1 C": SORT S1 ascending over released C,A,B.
      *>  5-7 "S2 3".."S2 1": SORT S2 descending over released 1,3,2;
      *>    S2 shares S1's sort storage (GR4 a) - reuse is transparent,
      *>    the second sort orders correctly.
      *>  8-10 "S3 X".."S3 Z": S3 is named in a SORT-MERGE clause; by
      *>    SR1 that clause is the same sort-merge-area format, so the
      *>    program is legal and S3 sorts exactly as S1 does.
      *>  11 "R F3-ONE F4-ONE": F3/F4 storage may have been used for the
      *>    sorts (GR4 b); that never alters their FILES, and reading
      *>    both back (both open at once, GR4 c) gives each its own
      *>    record.
