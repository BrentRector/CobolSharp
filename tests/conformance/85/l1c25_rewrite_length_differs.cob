      *> cite.py: OK  §13.18.43.4 13) a)  (General rules) - the REWRITE
      *>   record length is "the content of the data item referenced by
      *>   data-name-1" (DEPENDING ON)
      *> cite.py: OK  §13.18.43.4 15)  (General rules) - after a
      *>   successful READ data-name-1 holds "the number of bytes in the
      *>   record just read"
      *> Both lengths stay within FROM 5 TO 20, so GR20 ('44') does not
      *> apply; with GR18 the REWRITE succeeds and the new length is
