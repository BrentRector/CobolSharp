      *>           remainder = 10 − 3.33 × 3 = 10 − 9.99 = 0.01 (the display of a V-scaled item carries no
      *>           point, so 3.33 prints 333 and 0.01 prints 001).

      *>           ROUNDED, so the STORED quotient is 6.7 — but the subsidiary quotient is derived from
      *>           the QUOTIENT by TRUNCATION, i.e. 6.6, so the remainder is 20 − 6.6 × 3 = 0.20. An
      *>           implementation that back-multiplied the ROUNDED stored value would compute
      *>           20 − 6.7 × 3 = −0.10 and print 010 into the unsigned receiver.
      *>   F=SIZEERR 777   §14.7.5 case 2 — division by zero raises the size error condition; with the ON

      *> THE RULE'S THIRD MODE IS NOT SILENTLY SKIPPED. Both GR1 and GR7 name standard-decimal AND
