      *> ISO 13.18.16.2 (CONTROL clause general format, rendered from the PDF): the second operand form is
      *> FINAL [ data-name-1 ] ... - FINAL is written ONCE, FIRST, and the ellipsis applies only to the bracket
      *> enclosing data-name-1 (5.2.7: "the ellipsis applies to the portion of the format between the
      *> determined pair of delimiters").  13.18.16.4 GR2: "FINAL, if specified, is associated with the highest
      *> level in the hierarchy."  13.14.3 SR2: "The clauses that follow report-name-1 may appear in any
      *> order", and 13.18.39.3 SR4: "The HEADING, FIRST DETAIL, LAST CONTROL HEADING, LAST DETAIL, and FOOTING
      *> phrases may be written in any order" - an ORDER licence, exercised below (CONTROL after PAGE; LAST
      *> DETAIL before HEADING before FIRST DETAIL), which kb/Work PB483's once-only screens must not refuse.

      *> DERIVATION OF THE EXPECTED OUTPUT.  13.18.16.4 GR3: the first GENERATE saves WS-K (1) as the prior
      *> control; the second finds it unchanged; the third finds 2, so "control break processing for that level
      *> and any lower levels is performed" - WS-K is the minor level, FINAL the major (GR1/GR2), so ONLY the
      *> CF WS-K group is produced.  14.9.46.4 GR3 b): at TERMINATE "Each control footing is printed, if
      *> defined, beginning with the minor control footing ... as though a control break has been sensed in
      *> the most major control data item" - CF WS-K, then CF FINAL.  Each USE BEFORE REPORTING procedure
      *> DISPLAYs its group's name just before the group is produced, so the three lines are, in order:
      *>   BEFORE CF WS-K / BEFORE CF WS-K / BEFORE CF FINAL
