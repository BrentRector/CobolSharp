      *> The COBOL-85 half of the Annex A.3 item 43 claim (the 2023 witness is
      *> tests/conformance/2023/pb721_zero_length_record.cob, which carries the full
      *> derivation). It exists because the capability and 13.18.43.3 SR7's permission
      *> to write a ZERO minimum are NOT edition-dependent, and the way that fact fails
      *> is a gate leaking downward: a >=2023 gate written on RECORD IS VARYING IN SIZE
      *> FROM 0 would reject legal COBOL-85 here and nowhere else.
      *>
      *> The edition question was settled before the code, not after: Annex E is the
      *> COMPLETE 2014->2023 delta and carries no entry for a zero minimum record size
      *> or for zero-length records generally (its only zero-length entry, E.2 item 23,
      *> is reference modification), so SR7 is not a 2023 introduction; and
      *> docs/VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE.md records that this repository's spec cannot
      *> speak for the 85<->2002 delta at all, so any gate below 2014 would be INVENTED
      *> rather than derived. Determination: no edition gate anywhere - which is what
      *> this program measures. kb/Work PB721.
