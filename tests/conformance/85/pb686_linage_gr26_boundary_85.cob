      *> a)/b) boundary at LINAGE-COUNTER = page size" (kb/Work PB686)
      *> resolves a contradiction between GR26's printed arms and
      *> §13.18.34.4 GR1/GR2/GR3/GR7. The 2023 twin carries the full
      *> derivation with its cite.py --check lines; it is not repeated
      *> here, because one rule belongs in one place. What is asserted
      *> HERE is that the boundary answers identically at --std 85.
      *>
      *> WHY IT SHOULD. docs/VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE.md records every
      *> edition delta on this material, and there is NO entry for
      *> GR26 a)/b), for the footing area of §13.18.34.4 GR3, or for
      *> the LINAGE-COUNTER rules of GR7. The one WRITE/END-OF-PAGE
      *> delta it does record is Table 1 item 37 (2014→2023): what
      *> happens when an end-of-page condition occurs and NO
      *> END-OF-PAGE phrase is specified. Every WRITE below specifies
      *> BOTH the AT and the NOT AT phrase, so item 37 cannot reach
      *> this fixture and the two goldens are comparable line for
      *> line. The inventory rows GR-13.18.34.4-2, GR-13.18.34.4-3 and
      *> GR-14.9.51.4-26 all carry editions 85,2002,2014,2023; this
      *> fixture is the evidence for the 85 end of that claim.
      *>
      *> The PLN file repeats the FTG boundary through the PLAIN-WRITE
      *> entry point (§13.18.34.4 GR7 c) 3 — an omitted ADVANCING
      *> phrase increments the counter by one), because the boundary
      *> comparison is reachable from more than one WRITE entry point
      *> and a one-arm fix is this repo's most reproducible defect.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES. Byte-identical to the 2023 twin's .out apart
      *> from nothing at all — the same seventeen lines, derived from
      *> §13.18.34.4 GR7d (1 at OPEN OUTPUT), GR7 c) 2 (+1 per
      *> ADVANCING 1 LINE), GR7 c) 4 (reset to 1 on the overflow
      *> reposition), §13.18.34.4 GR3 (the footing area includes the
      *> page-size line), §13.18.34.4 GR1 (no FOOTING phrase ⇒ no
      *> end-of-page condition independent of page overflow) and
      *> §14.9.51.4 GR26 as the determination reads it (arm a) at
      *> counter > page size, arm b) over [footing start, page size]).
      *> The two ⚖ lines are F3 (EOP with LC=004, not LC=001) and N3
      *> (NO-EOP with LC=004): under the rejected literal reading of
      *> GR26 a) both would read EOP with LC=001, and the last line of
      *> every page body would be unwritable.
