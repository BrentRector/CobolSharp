      *> kb/Work PB443 - the LEGAL half of SEARCH's identifier-1 rules (ISO 14.9.37.3 SR1-SR3, ALL FORMATS),
      *> every case one the rule that refuses its siblings ADMITS. The expected output is derived from the
      *> rules, never from a run:
      *>   SEARCH E IN G2       - 8.4.2.2 says qualification is what establishes uniqueness, and 14.9.37.4
      *>                          GR1 says the statement varies "the first or only index associated with
      *>                          identifier-1", so identifier-1 is G2's E and the index varied is IX2.
      *>                          G1 is declared FIRST and holds NO matching key, so a base-word lookup that
      *>                          broke the tie by declaration order would scan G1 and reach AT END.
      *>   SEARCH E OF G2       - OF and IN are the same qualifier connective (8.4.2.2.2 Format 1), so this
      *>                          spelling must give the identical answer.
      *>   SEARCH ALL E IN G2   - SR1-SR3 are ALL FORMATS; Format 2 prints the same identifier-1 operand.
      *>                          14.9.37.4 GR9 leaves the technique to the implementor, so only the FOUND
      *>                          occurrence is asserted, which GR1a fixes: the index is left at the
      *>                          occurrence whose WHEN was satisfied.
      *>   SEARCH INNER (OX)    - SR2 forbids a subscript at the SEARCHED level, and ONLY there, so a
      *>                          superordinate one is admitted: a screen banning subscripts outright would
      *>                          reject this. OX is 2, and GR1's "the subscript that is used to determine the
      *>                          occurrence of each superordinate table to search is specified by the user in
      *>                          the WHEN phrases" makes the searched row the SECOND, K values 21..24.
      *>   SEARCH INNER (bare)  - THE SAME NESTED TABLE WITH NO SUBSCRIPT AT ALL, and it is equally legal.
      *>                          SR3 ("identifier-1 may be contained within one or more other tables, for
      *>                          which the subscripting is still required") reads like a demand on
      *>                          identifier-1, and GR1 says where that subscripting actually is: in the WHEN
      *>                          phrases. So the two spellings must give the SAME answer - written here with
      *>                          OX still 2, so the row searched is again the second. The CCVS suite writes
      *>                          only this form (NC233A: SEARCH ALL GRP2-ENTRY ... WHEN SEC (IDX-1, IDX-2)).
      *>   SEARCH ALL ... CN OF K2 - 8.4.2.2 Format 2 decides which level-88 a qualified condition-name
      *>                          names. The KEY phrase is "ASCENDING KEY IS K2 K1", so K2 is the MOST
      *>                          significant key (13.18.38.4 GR3) and referencing it alone satisfies SR11
      *>                          ("all preceding data-names ... shall also be referenced" - there are
      *>                          none). CN OF K2 has VALUE 07, and the table is sequenced on K2, so the
      *>                          match is the occurrence whose K2 is 07.
