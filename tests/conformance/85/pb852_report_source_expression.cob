      *> ⛔ THE SOURCE CLAUSE'S OTHER OPERAND FORM, AND ITS ROUNDED PHRASE (kb/Work PB852).  ISO 13.18.53.2's
      *> general format (PDF p485 rendered) writes
      *>     { SOURCE IS | SOURCES ARE } { identifier-1 | arithmetic-expression-1 } … [ rounded-phrase ]
      *> — the ellipsis follows the OPERAND brace pair, and the rounded-phrase sits OUTSIDE it, governing the
      *> whole clause.  COBOL.NET's grammar was `(SOURCE|SOURCES) (IS|ARE)? dataReference+`: neither the
      *> expression operand nor the ROUNDED phrase had any surface, so 13.18.53.3 SR3/SR5/SR7 and 13.18.53.4 GR2
      *> had no reachable population at all and `SOURCE IS (WS-A + WS-B)` was a raw parse error.
      *>
      *> THE RULES.  13.18.53.4 GR2: "Arithmetic-expression-1 specifies the operand of an implicit COMPUTE
      *> statement that is executed implicitly whenever the associated item is printed.  If the ROUNDED phrase is
      *> specified, the implicit COMPUTE statement has the corresponding ROUNDED phrase."  13.18.53.3 SR5: "If
      *> identifier-1 is specified with the ROUNDED phrase, it is considered to be an arithmetic-expression" — so
      *> the phrase turns even a bare identifier operand into GR2's COMPUTE, which is why one classifier decides
      *> the form for both clauses.  SR7: "If the SOURCE clause has more than one operand of which at least one is
      *> an arithmetic-expression, each operand shall be enclosed in parentheses" — the rule that makes an operand
      *> LIST readable once an operand may itself contain operators, and it is ENFORCED (COBOLNET2142), not
      *> assumed from the grammar's shape.
      *>
      *> DERIVATION OF THE EXPECTED OUTPUT.  WS-A = 100, WS-B = 23, WS-F = 1.55, WS-N = 2.  One TYPE DE group, one
      *> GENERATE; 13.18.14.4 GR1/GR2 place each field's leftmost character at its COLUMN.
      *>   COLUMN 1  PIC 9(3) SOURCE IS WS-A + WS-B   — GR2's COMPUTE: 100 + 23                        => 123
      *>   COLUMN 5  PIC 9(3) SOURCE IS WS-F ROUNDED  — SR5 makes it an expression, GR2 gives the COMPUTE
      *>                                                the ROUNDED phrase; 14.7.4.3 rule 1 with no
      *>                                                DEFAULT ROUNDED MODE clause is NEAREST-AWAY-FROM-ZERO,
      *>                                                so 1.55 into a scale-0 item                     => 002
      *>   COLUMN 9  PIC 9(3) SOURCE IS WS-F          — no phrase: GR1's implicit MOVE, which truncates
      *>                                                (14.6.8.2 rule 4)                               => 001
      *> SR7's multi-operand form needs a REPEATING entry (SR6), whose only vehicles — a multiple COLUMN or LINE
      *> clause, or a report-group OCCURS — are COBOL-2002 introductions, so it is witnessed by the 2002 sibling
      *> tests/conformance/2002/pb852_report_source_operand_parens.cob and its negative twin.
