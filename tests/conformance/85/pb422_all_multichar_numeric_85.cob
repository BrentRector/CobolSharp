*> kb/Work PB422 - a multi-character ALL literal ASSOCIATED with a numeric item at COBOL-85, where the
*> association is admitted (an obsolete element of ANSI X3.23-1985, deleted by ISO 2002 - VCR Table 7 row
*> 7.13, a DERIVED edge; from 2002 ISO 8.3.3.6.3 SR3 prohibits it: "If the length of literal-1 is greater than
*> one, it is not permitted to be associated with a numeric or numeric-edited item").
*> Expected values, from the rules, not measured:
*>  MOVE ALL "57" TO N (PIC 9(3)): 14.9.25.4 GR6 3) b. - "the number of digits is the same as the number of
*>    digits in the receiving operand and the figurative constant is replicated in this item, from left to
*>    right" - with 8.3.3.6.4 GR2's repeat-and-truncate: "575".
*>  IF N = ALL "57" / ALL "56": 8.8.4.2.5 - the integer operand is treated as moved to an alphanumeric item
*>    "of the same length in terms of character positions as the number of digits in the integer" (3), and the
*>    figurative takes that associated length (8.3.3.6.4 GR2): "575" = "575" is EQ, "575" vs "565" is NE.
*>  EVALUATE N WHEN ALL "57": the same comparison through the selection-object pairing.
