      *> ISO 14.9.39.4 GR6 - SET condition-name-1 TO TRUE over a GROUP conditional variable, and the two halves
      *> of the rule that no test reached (kb/Work PB462):
      *>   "the literal in the VALUE clause associated with condition-name-1 is placed in the conditional
      *>    variable according to the rules for the VALUE clause, except that when the conditional variable is an
      *>    alphanumeric group item, bit group item, or national group item to which a table is subordinate, its
      *>    length is determined as specified in 13.18.38, OCCURS clause" - so the receiving LENGTH is the
      *>    table's CURRENT extent (13.18.38.4 GR7/GR8: data-name-1's value), not its maximum; and
      *>   "If the length of the conditional variable is zero, the SET statement leaves it unchanged."
      *> 13.18.60.3 SR11 bars only four ELEMENTARY classes from being a conditional variable, never a group, so
      *> the group case is named by the rule and required.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED FROM THE RULES, NOT MEASURED:
      *>   WS-N = 3 -> the group is 3 character positions, so "ABCDE" is placed by the VALUE-clause rules for an
      *>               alphanumeric group receiver (13.18.63.4 GR5 - left-justified, excess truncated) = "ABC".
      *>   WS-N = 0 -> the length is zero, so the SET leaves the conditional variable UNCHANGED; restoring the
      *>               extent therefore shows the value written before it, "ZZZ", and not "ABC".
      *>   WS-N = 5 -> the group is 5 positions and the whole literal fits = "ABCDE".
