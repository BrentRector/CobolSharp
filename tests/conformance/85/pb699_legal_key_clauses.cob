      *> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5 - the LEGAL twin of the pb699-* negatives, and the over-rejection
      *> guard on the entry-time key screen (kb/Work PB699). Every shape the screen could get wrong
      *> is here and must BIND AND RUN:
      *>   - a prime RECORD KEY that is a GROUP item (12.4.5.12.3 SR2 admits an alphanumeric group;
      *>     13.18.29.4 GR3 makes a group with no GROUP-USAGE clause an alphanumeric group item),
      *>   - an ALTERNATE RECORD KEY WITH DUPLICATES inside the same record,
      *>   - a QUALIFIED key reference (IX-K IN IX-REC), which resolves through the record and so
      *>     satisfies "within a record description entry associated with the file-name",
      *>   - a relative file whose RELATIVE KEY is an unsigned integer in WORKING-STORAGE, i.e.
      *>     OUTSIDE the record (12.4.5.13.3 SR2 and SR3 both satisfied), under ACCESS DYNAMIC so
      *>     12.4.5.2 SR10's requirement is met by writing the clause.
      *> Expected output is derived from the file semantics, not observed: the indexed walk prints the
      *> three records in PRIME KEY order (12.4.5.12.4 GR1 - the prime key is unique and READ NEXT
      *> follows the key sequence: A1/A2/A3), and the relative reads name records 2 then 1 by
      *> relative record number (12.4.5.13.4 GR1/GR2), printing their contents in that order.
