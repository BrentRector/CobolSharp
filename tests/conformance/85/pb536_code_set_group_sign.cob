      *> ISO 13.18.13.3 SR3 a): "if alphabet-name-1 is specified, all elementary data items of all record
      *> description entries associated with the file shall be described as usage display, and any signed
      *> numeric data items shall be described with the SIGN IS SEPARATE clause". 13.18.52.3 SR3 states the
      *> same requirement from the SIGN clause's side.
      *>
      *> WHAT "DESCRIBED WITH" MEANS FOR A SUBORDINATE ITEM is 13.18.52.4 GR1: "The SIGN clause specifies the
      *> position and the mode of representation of the operational sign for the numeric item to which it
      *> applies, OR FOR EACH NUMERIC ITEM SUBORDINATE TO THE GROUP TO WHICH IT APPLIES." N is subordinate to
      *> G, G carries SIGN IS LEADING SEPARATE, and N's picture character-string contains 'S' (GR1 sentence 2),
      *> so the clause applies to N: this record IS described with the SIGN IS SEPARATE clause and the program
      *> SHALL COMPILE. The compiler used to refuse it with COBOLNET1672 because the screen ran at file-section
      *> bind time, one phase before the group-clause propagation - a rejection by an ordering, not by a rule.
      *>
      *> EVERY expected character below is computed from the rules, never read off a run:
      *>   13.18.52.4 GR6 a) - with SEPARATE CHARACTER "the operational sign is presumed to be the leading
      *>     (or, respectively, trailing) character position of the data item to which it applies; this
      *>     character position is not a digit position", and GR6 b) - "The operational signs for positive and
      *>     negative are the basic special characters '+' and '-', respectively". LEADING, so N is one sign
      *>     character followed by its four digit positions: 5 character positions.
      *>   14.9.25.4 GR5 / 14.6.8 - MOVE -12 TO a S9(4) receiver aligns on the decimal point and space-fills,
      *>     which for a numeric receiver is zero fill: the digit positions hold 0012. With the negative sign
      *>     of GR6 b) that is the five characters -0012.
      *>   The record R is those 5 positions followed by T's 2 - the 7 characters -0012ZZ - and 13.18.13.4 GR7
      *>     makes STANDARD-1's medium correspondence the identity on these characters, so the round trip
      *>     through the file is byte-exact and R reads back unchanged.
      *>
      *> The other direction - a signed numeric record item under a CODE-SET FD that is described with NO
      *> SIGN SEPARATE clause at all, neither its own nor an inherited one - is
