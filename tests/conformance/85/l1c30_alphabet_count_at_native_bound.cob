      *> "Shall not EXCEED" makes EQUAL legal. The native alphanumeric
      *>   set
      *> is the 65,536 UTF-16 code units, ordinal n = code unit n-1

      *> specifies exactly 65,536 characters - the bound itself. The
      *> source is legal and MUST compile; an off-by-one count check
      *> (">=" for ">") would reject it. The violating side (> 65,536)
      *> cannot be written without naming a character twice, which SR14
      *> a) already forbids, so only the at-bound side is observable.
      *> GR7 k) 5. assigns the range in DESCENDING native order:
      *>   position
      *> p holds native ordinal 65537-p, i.e. the collating sequence is
      *> the exact reverse of the native order.
      *> DERIVATION of every .out line (native codes: "0"=48 "A"=65
      *> "B"=66 "a"=97; under the reversed sequence a higher code
      *> collates LOWER):
      *>   "B" (66) < "A" (65)   -> B-LT-A=Y  (native order: N)
      *>   "a" (97) < "A" (65)   -> LA-LT-A=Y (native order: N)
