      *> kb/Work PB432 — the §14.9.28.2 varying-phrase FROM/BY brace group, every alternative it prints,
      *> at the edition the phrase has existed at since. Rendered from the printed page 683 / PDF 713:
      *>     VARYING {identifier-2|index-name-1} FROM {identifier-3|index-name-2|literal-1}
      *>             [ BY {identifier-4|literal-2} ] UNTIL condition-1
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED FROM THE RULES AND NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>
      *> A  literal-1 written as the FIGURATIVE ZERO. §14.9.28.3 SR3 restricts every literal in this phrase to
      *>    NUMERIC, which is exactly the precondition of §8.3.3.6.3 SR1 ("If the literal is restricted to a
      *>    numeric literal, the only figurative constant permitted is ZERO"), so ZERO is admitted and denotes 0
      *>    (§8.3.3.6.4). GR13 a) initializes I to 0; GR13 e) tests I > 3 before each iteration and augments by
      *>    1 after it, so the body runs for I = 0,1,2,3 => NA = 4. This spelling used to be a hard PARSE ERROR.
      *> B  the plural spelling ZEROS is the same figurative constant (§8.3.3.6.2 Format 1) => NB = 3 (I = 0,1,2).
      *> C  a SIGNED literal-2. §8.3.3.3.2 rule 2 makes the sign part of the literal, so -1 is literal-2 and not
      *>    an expression; GR12's augment value is then -1 and the induction variable DECREMENTS: I = 5,4,3,2,1
      *>    => NC = 5.
      *> D  index-name-2 in the FROM phrase. GR12: "the occurrence number corresponding to the value of the index
      *>    referenced by the index-name ... is referred to as the initialization value", and SET IX2 TO 2 makes
      *>    that occurrence number 2, so IX1 runs 2,3,4 => ND = 3.
      *> E  identifier-3 and identifier-4. GR12 re-reads the BY operand at every augment, and nothing changes it
      *>    here, so I = 4,8,12 and the test I > 12 ends it => NE = 3.
      *>
      *>   NA=0004 NB=0003 NC=0005 ND=0003 NE=0003
