      *> reserved words (ISO 8.9), interchangeable only where the figurative constant itself is written:
      *> 8.3.3.6.2 format 1 lists "ZERO | ZEROES | ZEROS" as alternatives. Where a general format names
      *> ONE of them as a keyword (5.2.2 "They are required in order to select the functionality
