      *> The EVALUATE selection-set shapes ISO §14.9.13.3 admits, pinned so the SR2 / SR4 / SR9 screens

      *> SR2: "The number of selection objects within each set of selection objects shall be equal to the
      *> number of selection subjects."  A SET of selection objects is ONE WHEN phrase, so consecutive WHEN
      *> phrases sharing one imperative-statement are counted separately (leg TWO-PHRASES).
      *> SR7 c): "The word ANY may correspond to a selection subject of any type", and §14.9.13.4 GR4 a) 1.
      *> makes such a pair true without consulting the subject (leg ANY-OK) — ANY still OCCUPIES a position
      *> and is counted.
      *> SR4: "The two operands in a range-expression shall be of the same class and shall not be of class
      *> boolean, message-tag, object, or pointer."  CLASS is §8.5.2.1 Table 2's, so a PIC A pair is a legal
      *> same-class (alphabetic) range (leg ALPHA-RANGE) and a numeric pair a legal numeric one.
      *> SR9: "Neither identifier-3 nor identifier-4 shall reference a variable-length group."  §8.5.1.12.1
      *> defines that term as "a group item whose data description has at least one dynamic-length elementary
      *> item or dynamic-capacity table as a subordinate item" — an OCCURS DEPENDING ON group is NOT one, its
      *> size being its maximum, so leg ODO-RANGE is legal source and shall compile (kb/Work PB399's own
      *> repro program had this premise backwards).
