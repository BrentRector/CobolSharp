      *> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5 - the LEGAL twin of the pb742-* / pb743-* negatives, and the
      *> over-rejection guard on the two rules they add (kb/Work PB742, PB743). Every shape the new
      *> rows could get wrong is here and must BIND AND RUN:
      *>   - a SEQUENTIAL file with NO key clause and no ORGANIZATION clause at all, i.e. the shape
      *>     12.4.5.10.3 GR6 makes record sequential. It is the population SR8's row is screened
      *>     over, so it is the one that proves the row fires on the CLAUSE and not on the
      *>     organization (SQF, below - it is read and written).
      *>   - an INDEXED file whose prime RECORD KEY is a GROUP item: 12.4.5.12.3 SR2's category arm
      *>     admits it because 13.18.29.4 GR3 makes "a group item for which a GROUP-USAGE clause is
      *>     not specified or implied" an ALPHANUMERIC GROUP ITEM. A category screen written as a
      *>     bare elementary-PICTURE test would refuse this, so it is the category arm's boundary.
      *>   - an ALTERNATE RECORD KEY that is a plain PIC X elementary item, inside the record.
      *>   - a RELATIVE file whose RELATIVE KEY is a NUMERIC item in WORKING-STORAGE. Three rules
      *>     meet on it and none may fire: 12.4.5.13.3 SR2 REQUIRES the unsigned integer that
      *>     12.4.5.12.3 SR2 forbids for a record key (so the category arm must not leak across key
      *>     roles), SR3 REQUIRES it outside the record, and SR9 admits the clause because the file
      *>     IS relative.
      *>   - a SORT-MERGE file described by an SD whose entry is a legal 12.4.5.1 Format 4 - ASSIGN
      *>     plus "[ ORGANIZATION IS ] SEQUENTIAL" and nothing else. This one is load-bearing: the
      *>     screen used to skip every sort-merge file with a blanket early return, and SR8/SR9's
      *>     second sentence is what replaced it, so a legal SD must still draw nothing.
      *> ⚠ A category-NATIONAL key is legal under both SR2s and is NOT exercised here: a national
      *> leaf inside a file record is refused by this compiler's own byte-addressed-surface rule
      *> (PicCategory.National, D-N2), so a golden for it would test that refusal, not SR2.
      *> DERIVATION - every expected line follows from the rules, nothing from the compiler:
      *>  · 12.4.5.12.4 GR1 makes the prime key unique and READ NEXT follows the key sequence, so the
      *>    indexed walk prints AA/BB/CC in that order whatever order they were written in.
      *>  · 12.4.5.13.4 GR1/GR2: a random READ names the record whose relative record number equals
      *>    the RELATIVE KEY's value, so R=0002 prints "TWO ".
      *>  · 14.9.40.4 GR8 a): SORT's ASCENDING key returns the lower key value first, so the drain
      *>    prints S=1 then S=2 from records released in the order 2, 1.
      *>  · The sequential file is written with one record and read back verbatim (9.1.x): SEQ=HELLO.
