      *>   1) two index-names. The result is the same as if the corresponding occurrence
      *>      numbers were compared."

      *> I1/J1 index T1 (elements of 4 characters), I2 indexes T2 (elements of 8
      *> characters), so an index VALUE that were a displacement would differ from the
      *> occurrence number differently for each table. The rule compares OCCURRENCE
      *> numbers, so the element sizes must not matter.
