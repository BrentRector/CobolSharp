      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §14.9.27.4 GR10 — the OPEN statement's fixed
      *> file attribute comparison, and the Annex A.1 item 129 validated
      *> set it delegates to the implementor (kb/Work PB193).
      *>
      *> GR10: "During the execution of the OPEN statement when the file
      *> connector is matched with the file and the file exists, the
      *> attributes of the file connector as specified in the file
      *> control paragraph and the file description entry are compared
      *> with the fixed file attributes of the file. If the attributes
      *> don't match, a file attribute conflict condition occurs, the
      *> execution of the OPEN statement is unsuccessful, and the I-O
      *> status associated with file-name-1 is set to '39'." It then
      *> delegates: "The implementor defines which of the fixed-file
      *> attributes are validated during the execution of the OPEN
      *> statement. The validation of fixed-file attributes may vary
      *> depending on the organization or storage medium of the file."
      *>
      *> COBOL.NET's determination USES that permission, and this golden
      *> pins BOTH of its arms:
      *>
      *>   PART A (steps 1-9), a RELATIVE subject. A relative store is
      *>   an implementor-defined structure whose layout IS the record
      *>   type and the record sizes, so those are validated along with
      *>   the organization — §9.1.6's "primary attribute", of which
      *>   §9.1.6 names exactly three: "There are three organizations:
      *>   sequential, relative, and indexed". The indexed key
      *>   attributes are the 2023 twin, ..._conflict_ix.
      *>
      *>   PART B (steps 10-13), a SEQUENTIAL subject. A sequential file
      *>   validates NOTHING beyond the organization, because §9.1.7.2
      *>   puts its record lengths in the data and in the reading
      *>   program rather than in the file — "In record sequential files
      *>   the length of each record is determined by any information
      *>   the implementor may add to the record on the physical storage
      *>   medium (such as record length headers)", and COBOL.NET adds
      *>   none to a fixed-length record sequential file — and because
      *>   the standard answers the resulting disagreement with a
      *>   SUCCESSFUL completion: §9.1.13.2 item 3, "I-O status = 04. A
      *>   READ statement is successfully executed but the physical
      *>   record from the file is shorter than or longer than the
      *>   minimum or maximum length of records allowed for the fixed
      *>   file attributes for that file." Step 12 shows that '04'
      *>   happening where a '39' at step 11 would have made it
      *>   unreachable. Step 13 shows the organization is still
      *>   validated for a sequential file.
      *>
      *> The rule is version-invariant (inventory row GR-14.9.27.4-10:
      *> 85, 2002, 2014, 2023), so it is pinned at the OLDEST edition
      *> here and at the newest by the indexed twin.
      *>
      *> STEP 6 pins the other half of the determination: §14.9.27.4
      *> GR18 — "If the OUTPUT phrase is specified, the successful
      *> execution of the OPEN statement creates the file" — makes an
      *> OPEN OUTPUT a CREATION, and §9.1.6 fixes a file's attributes
      *> "at the time it is created". So OPEN OUTPUT is never judged
      *> against the previous file's attributes; it ESTABLISHES them,
      *> and steps 7 and 8 show the roles of the two FDs swapped.
