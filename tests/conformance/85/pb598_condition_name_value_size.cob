      *> ISO 13.18.63.3 SR4 - "If the item is of category alphabetic,
      *> alphanumeric, or alphanumeric-edited literals in the VALUE
      *> clause shall be alphanumeric literals.  Alphanumeric literals
      *> in the VALUE clause of AN ELEMENTARY ITEM shall not exceed the
      *> size indicated by AN EXPLICIT PICTURE clause.  Alphanumeric
      *> literals in the VALUE clause of an alphanumeric GROUP ITEM
      *> shall not exceed the size of the group item."

      *> THE SUBJECT THE SIZE SENTENCES DO NOT NAME (kb/Work PB598).
      *> Sentences 2 and 3 bound two subjects: an elementary item and a
      *> group item.  A Format-3 entry is `88 condition-name-1
      *> value-clause .` (13.16.2) - no PICTURE clause is writable in
      *> it, so no EXPLICIT picture indicates a size - and its subject
      *> is a CONDITION-NAME (13.16.4 GR3; 13.18.63.3 SR33 - "Formats 3
      *> and 5 may be specified only when the level-number of the
      *> subject of the entry is 88"), an entry for which there is "no
      *> true concept of level" (8.5.1.3.2 item 3) and so neither an
      *> elementary item nor a group item (8.5.1.3.1).  13.18.63.4 GR19
      *> gives a condition-name its conditional variable's
      *> characteristics only IMPLICITLY - which is what "explicit"
      *> excludes.  Measured before this fix: every line below was
      *> COBOLNET1740, legal source rejected.
      *>
      *> AND THE STANDARD SAYS WHAT AN OVERSIZE ONE MEANS, which a size
      *> rule would make dead text:
      *>  - 8.8.4.5.3 item 2 - "The rules for comparing a conditional
      *>    variable with a condition-name value are the same as those
      *>    specified for relation conditions", so a longer literal
      *>    simply never compares equal: 8.8.4.2.7 item 2 - "If the
      *>    operands are of unequal length, comparison proceeds as
      *>    though the shorter operand were extended on the right by
      *>    sufficient alphanumeric spaces to make the operands of
      *>    equal length" - a permanently-FALSE condition.
      *>  - 14.9.39.4 GR6 - SET condition-name TO TRUE places the
      *>    literal "according to the rules for the VALUE clause"
      *>    -> 13.18.63.4 GR7 -> 14.6.8.5, "aligned at the leftmost
      *>    character position in the data item with space fill or
      *>    TRUNCATION TO THE RIGHT, as required".
      *>
      *> Every DISPLAY below is derived from those rules, not measured:
      *> T1  XV = "c"; XC is "cd"; "c " vs "cd" differs at position 2
      *>     (space < d) -> FALSE.
      *> T2  SET XC TO TRUE -> 14.6.8.5 truncates "cd" to the right into
      *>     one position -> XV = "c"; and XC is still FALSE.
      *> T3  XV = "c"; XR is the range "aa" THRU "zz" (SR26a: "aa" <
      *>     "zz", conforming).  "c " > "aa" (c > a at position 1) and
      *>     "c " < "zz" (c < z), so 14.7.8's range contains it -> TRUE.
      *> T4  XV = "A"; "A " < "aa" in the native collating sequence
      *>     -> below the range -> FALSE.
      *> T5  YV = "de"; YC is the two-member set "abc" "de"; the second
      *>     member compares equal -> TRUE.  An oversize member does not
      *>     poison the set.
      *> T6  YV = "ab"; "ab" vs "abc" differs at position 3 (space < c)
      *>     and "ab" vs "de" at position 1 -> FALSE.  An oversize
      *>     member does not match by prefix either.
      *> T7  SET YC TO TRUE takes "the value of the first literal"
      *>     (14.9.39.4 GR6) -> "abc" truncated to the right into two
      *>     positions -> YV = "ab", and YC is then FALSE.
      *> T8  The BOUNDARY: a literal of exactly the subject's size is
      *>     unaffected - ZC is "cd" over two positions -> TRUE.
      *>
      *> This program is COBOL-85 source and every rule it exercises is
      *> edition-invariant; ConditionNameValueSizeTests re-compiles the
      *> same shapes at 2002, 2014 and 2023.
