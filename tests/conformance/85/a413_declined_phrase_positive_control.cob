*> THE POSITIVE CONTROL for the Annex A.4.8 / A.4.13 declines (COBOLNET1705 / COBOLNET1706).
*>
*> A refusal gate is only evidence if it also proves what it did NOT take down. A.4.1 NOTE 1 is the reason
*> there is anything left to prove: "The higher-level constructs or cross-referenced topics are not
*> optional" - only the `FILE file-name-1` ALTERNATIVE of `{ record-name-1 | FILE file-name-1 }` is
*> declined, while the WRITE (14.9.51) and REWRITE (14.9.35) statements themselves are mandatory, fully
*> supported surface. This program exercises the surviving arm end to end - WRITE record-name-1 FROM,
*> READ INTO, REWRITE record-name-1, CLOSE - and RUNS, byte-comparing its output.
*>
*> It also pins the OPTIONAL WORD `RECORD` of 14.9.35.2 (RENDERED, PDF p710: not underlined, therefore
*> optional). The grammar did not accept it at all until 2026-09-02, so `REWRITE F-REC RECORD` - legal at
*> every edition, on the mandatory arm - was rejected outright. It is written here twice, once with the
*> word and once without, because an optional word needs both spellings measured or half the fix is
*> invisible.
*>
*> Placed in the 85 corpus deliberately: every construct here is X3.23-1985 surface, so a green run at
*> --std 85 also proves the two new declines are keyed to the DECLINED spellings and not to the verbs.
