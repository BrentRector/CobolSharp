      *> ISO §14.9.25.4 GR6 d) 3 — THE SIZE OF AN ALPHANUMERIC SENDING OPERAND MOVING TO A NUMERIC
      *> RECEIVER, at the earliest edition COBOL.NET compiles. The rule is not edition-gated: it reads
      *> identically at 85, 2002, 2014 and 2023, and the 2002 golden pb426_alnum_sender_data_incompatible
      *> carries the legs that need a 19-31 digit receiver or the >>TURN checking model (both 2002+).
      *>
      *> THE RULE, --check validated:
      *>   cite.py --check 14.9.25.4 "in which case the rightmost 31 character positions are used"
      *>     -> OK §14.9.25.4 6) 3.  "a. If the sending operand is a data item, the number of digits is
      *>        the number of character positions in the sending data item unless the number of character
      *>        positions is greater than 31, in which case the rightmost 31 character positions are used."
      *>   cite.py --check 14.9.25.4 "only the rightmost 31 characters in the literal are used"
      *>     -> OK §14.9.25.4 6) 3.  (sub-rule c, the LITERAL twin of the same window)
      *>   cite.py --check 14.6.8.2 "aligned by decimal point"
      *>     -> OK §14.6.8.2 4)  "If the receiving operand is a fixed-point numeric item, the data is
      *>        aligned by decimal point and is transferred to the receiving digits with zero fill or
      *>        truncation on either end as required."
      *>   cite.py --check 14.9.48.4 "shall be moved into the current receiving area according to the
      *>     rules for the MOVE statement" -> OK §14.9.48.4 11) c)
      *>   (⚠ cite.py prints the approximate path "6) 3." for both MOVE sub-rules; the PRINTED rule numbers
      *>    are 6) d) 3) a. and 6) d) 3) c.  The CLAUSE and the TEXT are what the check establishes.)
      *>
      *> WHY EACH LEG CAN FAIL — the window is over CHARACTER POSITIONS, and it is a CAP, not a hope:
      *>   1  A40 -> PIC 9(9).  The operand is A40's rightmost 31 character positions,
      *>      "0123456789012345678901234567890" = 123456789012345678901234567890; §14.6.8.2 GR4 aligns it by
      *>      decimal point into nine digit positions, truncating high-order -> 234567890. Before kb/Work
      *>      PB426 the decode consumed all FORTY positions into a signed Int128 and WRAPPED: 838277934.
      *>   2  A40 -> PIC 9(18).  The same operand, eighteen digit positions -> 345678901234567890.
      *>   3  S40 -> PIC 9(9).  S40's rightmost 31 character positions hold only the four digits "1234", so
      *>      the operand is 1234 -> 000001234.  Reading all forty positions instead would give 9876543211234
      *>      -> 543211234.  This leg is what makes the CAP itself observable at nine digit positions: it
      *>      fails for an implementation with no cap, AND for one that caps at 31 DIGIT characters rather
      *>      than 31 character positions (S40 holds only 13 digits, so a digit cap never fires) -> 543211234.
      *>   4  A35 -> PIC 9(9).  Thirty-five characters is over the cap too: the window drops the leading
      *>      four, "5678901234567890123456789012345" -> 789012345.  A31 is exactly AT the cap and is
      *>      therefore unwindowed, "1234567890123456789012345678901" -> 345678901 — the control that fails
      *>      an off-by-one window (a rightmost-30 window would answer 456789012 there).
      *>   5  A40 -> PIC ZZZZZZZZ9.  The numeric-edited receiving arm is a SECOND emit site for the same
      *>      rule (§14.9.25.3 Table 16 admits alphanumeric -> numeric-edited); it carried its own uncapped
      *>      decode.  The edited image of 234567890 suppresses no zero (its high-order digit is 2).
      *>   6  S40 (1:40) -> PIC 9(9).  A reference-modified result is category alphanumeric (§8.4.3.3.4
      *>      GR6), so it is an alphanumeric SENDING OPERAND and takes the same window -> 000001234.
      *>   7  UNSTRING ... INTO PIC 9(9).  §14.9.48.4 GR11 c) transfers the examined characters "according
      *>      to the rules for the MOVE statement", so the window applies there too -> 000001234.
      *>
      *> NOTE Legs 3, 6 and 7 send content that is not all digits. At COBOL-85 no checking can be enabled
      *> (>>TURN is COBOL-2002 — negative/pb844-ec-data-incompatible-turn-below-2002), so §14.9.25.4 GR6 d) 1
      *> sets no condition here and the deterministic decode stands; the 2002 golden measures the checked
      *> reading.
