      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §5.5 1) (kb/Work PB859): "When the term 'integer-n' (n = 1, 2, ...) is used in a
      *> general format and associated rules, it refers to a fixed-point integer literal that shall be unsigned
      *> and nonzero unless otherwise specified in the associated rules." This is the POSITIVE control: every
      *> position below is one whose associated rule DOES otherwise-specify, so each zero is legal and the new
      *> NONZERO screen (COBOLNET2386) must not touch it:
      *>   LINAGE ... LINES AT TOP 0 / AT BOTTOM 0 - §13.18.34.3 SR4 "Integer-3, integer-4 may be zero."
      *>   RECORD CONTAINS 0 TO 80              - §13.18.43.3 SR8 "Integer-4 shall be greater than or equal to zero."
      *>   RECORD IS VARYING IN SIZE FROM 0     - §13.18.43.3 SR7 "Integer-2 shall be greater than or equal to zero."
      *>   OCCURS 0 TO 3 TIMES DEPENDING ON     - §13.18.38.3 SR16 "Integer-1 shall be greater than or equal to zero"
      *>   WRITE ... AFTER ADVANCING 0 LINES    - §14.9.51.3 SR15 "Integer-1 shall be positive or zero."
      *> Expected values, from the general rules: OPEN OUTPUT sets LINAGE-COUNTER to one and a WRITE with an
      *> ADVANCING phrase increments it by the integer (§13.18.34.4 GR7), so ADVANCING 0 leaves it at 1 and a
      *> following ADVANCING 2 makes it 3. The ODO table holds N = 0 occurrences, then 2 after MOVE 2 TO N.
      *> Fails if: any of these zeros draws COBOLNET2386 (an exception row missing from the one table in
      *> Validation/IntegerOperandPass.cs), or ADVANCING 0 moves the counter.
