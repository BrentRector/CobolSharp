      *> kb/Work PB391. ISO 1989:2023 14.7.6 rule 2: "In a MOVE statement, at least one of the data items is
      *> an elementary data item and the resulting move is valid according to the rules for the MOVE
      *> statement." The MOVE rules' category half is 14.9.25.3 SR10, table 16, and a pair whose move is
      *> INVALID simply DOES NOT CORRESPOND - a silent non-selection, never a diagnostic - so the receiving
      *> item keeps the content it had before the statement.
      *> Every cell below is read from table 16 AS PRINTED (specs/ISO_COBOL.md, 14.9.25.3):
      *>   Numeric/Integer      -> Alphabetic                        = No   NI2 keeps ZZZZZ
      *>   Alphabetic           -> Numeric                           = No   AL2 keeps 77777
      *>   Numeric/Noninteger   -> Alphanumeric                      = No   NN2 keeps PPPPP
      *>   Alphanumeric-edited  -> Numeric                           = No   AE2 keeps 88888
      *>   Alphanumeric         -> Alphanumeric-edited, Alphanumeric = Yes  OK2 becomes MOVE
      *>   Numeric/Integer      -> Numeric, Numeric-edited           = Yes  NU2 becomes 00042
      *> Rule 2 and the whole Format-2 surface are COBOL-85, and every category here is COBOL-85, so this is
      *> the rule at its introducing edition. The two Yes cells are the controls: without them a filter that
      *> refused EVERYTHING would print the same first four lines.
      *> Before PB391 the binder answered rule 2 from a SECOND, private, partial copy of table 16 instead of
      *> asking MoveTable16 - the copy had no alphabetic row or column at all - and the first four lines read
      *> NI2=[12345], AL2=[00000], NN2=[12.34], AE2=[00000].
