      *> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.30.3 syntax rule 1 (READ) and 14.9.34.3 syntax rule 2 (RETURN) admit the
      *> INTO phrase on two grounds: a) "If no record description entry or only one record
      *> description is subordinate to the file description entry" (RETURN: "If only one record
      *> description is subordinate to the sort-merge file description entry"), or b) "If the data
      *> item referenced by identifier-1 and all record-names associated with file-name-1 describe
      *> an alphanumeric group item or an elementary item of category alphanumeric or category
      *> national."  14.9.30.3 SR2 and 14.9.34.3 SR3 add the strongly-typed-receiver rule.
      *> THIS PROGRAM IS THE OVER-REJECT GUARD for kb/Work PB337, which gave those four rules their
      *> first implementation: every case below is source the rules ADMIT, and each is written so a
      *> screen that read only one arm would reject it.
      *> DERIVATION -- every expected line follows from the rules named, nothing from the compiler.
      *>  . A: ONE record description, so arm a) admits the phrase OUTRIGHT and the receiver's
      *>    category is never consulted.  WS-NUM is category numeric, which arm b) does NOT admit --
      *>    a screen that tested only arm b) would reject this legal program.  14.9.30.4 GR4 b)
      *>    moves the record area to WS-NUM "according to the rules for the MOVE statement", and
      *>    Table 16 admits an alphanumeric sender into an integer numeric receiver, so the four
      *>    characters "0042" written into the record arrive as the value 42: A=0042.
      *>  . B: TWO record descriptions, so arm a) FAILS and arm b) carries it -- both record-names
      *>    and identifier-1 are alphanumeric group items (13.18.29.4 GR3: no GROUP-USAGE clause,
      *>    not strongly typed, not a variable-length group).  The move is a group move, 14.9.25.4
      *>    GR4, "the receiving area is filled without consideration for the individual elementary
      *>    or group items", so the record's four characters arrive unchanged: B=[WXYZ].
      *>  . R: the RETURN twin of B -- an SD with TWO record descriptions, both alphanumeric groups,
      *>    into an alphanumeric group.  14.9.34.3 SR2 arm b), and 14.9.34.4 GR5 b) for the move.
      *>    One record is released, so it is the one returned: R=[WXYZ].
      *> The whole receiving area is displayed inside [ ] so a trailing-blank difference cannot be
      *> trimmed away by the corpus runner's per-line trailing-space normalisation.
      *> The 85 leg: TYPEDEF/TYPE and USAGE NATIONAL are COBOL-2002 introductions, so cases C and D
      *> are absent here -- 14.9.30.3 SR2 is unreachable at 1985 by construction.
