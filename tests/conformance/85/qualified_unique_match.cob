      *> kb/Work R31 - the 8.4.2.2.1 uniqueness is of the qualified MATCH, never of a qualifier
      *> name in isolation: two groups each declare an X, exactly one X holds a Z, so Z IN X is a
      *> UNIQUE reference and legal ("All available qualifiers need not be specified so long as
      *> uniqueness is established"). The old walk resolved the qualifier X first, failed on its
      *> ambiguity, and rejected this - GnuCOBOL's own syn_definition "Unique reference with
      *> ambiguous qualifiers" case, caught by the differential when R30 made the failure loud.
