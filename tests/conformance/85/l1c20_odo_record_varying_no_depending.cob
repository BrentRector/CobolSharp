      *>
      *> THE RULES.
      *> §13.18.38.4 GR9: "If format 2 is specified in a record
      *>   description entry and the associated file description or
      *>   sort-merge description entry contains the VARYING phrase of
      *>   the RECORD clause, the records are variable length. If the
      *>   DEPENDING ON phrase of the RECORD clause is not specified,
      *>   the content of the data item referenced by data-name-1 of
      *>   the OCCURS clause shall be set to the number of occurrences
      *>   to be written before the execution of any RELEASE,
      *>   REWRITE, or WRITE statement referencing that record
      *>   description entry."
      *>   OK  §13.18.38.4 9)  (General rules)
      *> §13.18.43.4 GR13 c): with no data-name-1 and a
      *>   variable-occurrence item, the size is "the sum of the fixed
      *>   portion and that portion of the table described by the
      *>   number of occurrences at the time of execution of the
      *>   output statement".
      *>   OK  §13.18.43.4 13) c)  (General rules)
      *> §13.18.43.4 GR15: with data-name-1, after a READ "the
      *>   contents of the data item referenced by data-name-1 will
      *>   indicate the number of bytes in the record just read".
      *>   OK  §13.18.43.4 15)  (General rules)
      *> §14.9.35.4 GR16 (record sequential): if the record's size "is
      *>   not equal to the number of bytes in the record being
      *>   replaced, the execution of the REWRITE statement is
      *>   unsuccessful and the I-O status in the rewrite file
      *>   connector is set to '44'".
      *>   OK  §14.9.35.4 16)  (General rules)
      *> §14.9.40.4 GR15 b): with GIVING, "the size of any record
      *>   written to file-name-3 is the size of that record when it
      *>   was read from file-name-1" (the sort file, here fed by
      *>   RELEASE).

      *> WRITE FN=1 "A" -> 2 bytes; FN=3 "BBB" -> 4; FN=6 "CCCCCC" -> 7.
      *> REWRITE of record 2 with FN still 3 (FC(2) now "X"): 4 = 4
