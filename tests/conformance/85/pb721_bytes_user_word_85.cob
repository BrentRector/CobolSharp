      *> THE OVER-REJECTION TWIN of the BYTES edition gate (kb/Work PB721).
      *> BYTES is a 8.10 CONTEXT-SENSITIVE word, not an 8.9 reserved word, at every
      *> supported edition, and 8.10 says what that means: "If a context-sensitive word
      *> is used where the context-sensitive word is permitted in the general format,
      *> the word is treated as a keyword; otherwise it is treated as a user-defined
      *> word." So gating the RECORD clause's BYTES SPELLING at 2023 may not cost a
      *> COBOL-85 program the right to NAME something BYTES - and adding a hard lexer
      *> token is exactly how that right gets lost silently.
      *> This program names an elementary item BYTES, a TABLE BYTES (so the subscript
      *> trigger is exercised too - a keyword token that never enters SUBSCRIPT mode
      *> turns `BYTES (1)` into a parse error rather than a reference), and a paragraph
      *> BYTES-PARA, and compiles at --std 85.
      *> EXPECTED VALUES: the moves and the subscripted references are ordinary
      *> alphanumeric ones - BYTES holds "USERWD", and the three table positions read
      *> back P, Q and R in order.
