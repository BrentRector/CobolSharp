      *> The '85 debug module was deleted by ISO/IEC 1989:2002 and is absent from ISO/IEC 1989:2023, so its
      *> authoritative behavior is the 1985 standard. WITH DEBUGGING MODE compiles the debugging section as real
      *> source (the compile-time switch); the object-time switch is ON (RunUnit.DebugMode, the CCVS posture), so
      *> the USE FOR DEBUGGING ON ALL PROCEDURES declarative runs just before each nondeclarative procedure and
      *> populates DEBUG-ITEM (DEBUG-NAME + the DEBUG-CONTENTS transfer-cause taxonomy — DB101A witness).
      *> Hand-derived stdout (each DEBUG-CONTENTS token is DB101A-pinned):
