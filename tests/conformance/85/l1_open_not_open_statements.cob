      *> ISO §14.9.27.4 GR6 — "When a file connector is not open, no
      *> statement shall be executed that references the associated
      *> file-name, either explicitly or implicitly, except for a MERGE
      *> or SORT statement with the USING or GIVING phrase, the COMMIT
      *> and ROLLBACK statements, a DELETE FILE statement, or an OPEN
      *> statement."
      *> The rule prohibits the PROGRAM; an implementation honours it by
      *> giving each forbidden statement that statement's §9.1.13.7
      *> logic-error status and leaving the file alone. F is never
      *> opened before the four attempts below; the expected values are
      *> quoted from §9.1.13.7:
      *>   CLOSE   item 2 — "A CLOSE or UNLOCK statement is attempted
      *>           for a file connector that is not in an open mode" =
      *>           '42'.
      *>   READ    item 7 — "a READ or START statement … referencing a
      *>           file connector that is not open in the input or I-O
      *>           mode" = '47'.
      *>   WRITE   item 8a — access mode sequential, "the file connector
      *>           is not open in the extend or output mode" = '48'.
      *>   REWRITE item 9 — "a DELETE RECORD or REWRITE statement …
      *>           referencing a file connector that is not open in the
      *>           I-O mode" = '49'. (Item 3's '43' presupposes an OPEN
      *>           connector whose LAST I-O statement was not a
      *>           successful READ; with no open mode at all only item
      *>           9 applies, so §9.1.13.1's "if more than one value
      *>           applies" tie-break is not reached.) §14.9.35.4 GR3
      *>           states the same value outright, without needing the
      *>           elimination: "If the open mode is some other value
      *>           or the file is not open, the I-O status in the
      *>           rewrite file connector is set to '49'".
      *> Then the EXEMPT statement: OPEN is the one verb the rule
      *> permits on a not-open connector, and it succeeds ('00',
      *> §9.1.13.2 item 1). The read-back proves the file holds exactly
      *> the ONE record written after that OPEN. The one forbidden
      *> statement that could have added a record is the WRITE, and its
      *> own rule says it did not — §14.9.51.4 GR15: "If the execution
      *> of a WRITE statement is unsuccessful, the write operation does
      *> not take place, the content of the record area is unaffected".
      *> (§14.9.27.4 GR25 is NOT the authority for this: its stem is
      *> scoped to "If the execution of the OPEN statement is
      *> unsuccessful", and none of the four forbidden statements is an
      *> OPEN.) The trailing '10' is §9.1.13.4 item 1a — "NEXT was
      *> specified or implied and the end of the physical file has been
      *> reached".
