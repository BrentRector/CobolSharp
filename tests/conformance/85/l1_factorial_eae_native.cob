      *> ⛔ WHY THE ASSERTIONS ARE RELATIONS AND NOT PRINTED DIGITS. Under native arithmetic
      *> §15.4.1 gives only "the value returned is an implementor-defined approximation of the
      *> value of that expression" (--check OK), so a pinned digit string would be a
      *> determination of this implementation dressed as a rule. Every line below instead relates
      *> TWO evaluations of the rule's OWN expressions, which r1 fixes with respect to each other
      *> however either is approximated: r1a gives 0! and 1! the SAME expression (1); r1b's (2) is
      *> that doubled and is equally r1c's product at n = 2; and r1c's product telescopes, so
      *> n! / (n-1)! is n. The one absolute pin, 1! = 1, is r1a's expression written out - it is
      *> the literal the standard prints, not a rendering.

      *> ⚠ NO INTRINSIC-FUNCTION GOLDEN EXISTED IN THE 85 CORPUS BEFORE THIS CHANGE SET, which
      *> lands two: this file and 85/l1_acos_domain_accept. FACTORIAL carries IntroducedIn 85 in
      *> IntrinsicCatalog (the 1989 Intrinsic Function Module amendment is part of the 85 dialect
      *> here), and the inventory row spans 85 through 2023, so the edition where the ONLY
      *> available arithmetic mode is the approximating one had no witness. Both files rest on the
      *> same premise - IntrinsicBinder's edition gate is `IntroducedIn > DialectLevel`, which
      *> 85 > 85 does not satisfy - so if a run shows --std 85 gating intrinsics after all, BOTH
      *> move to tests/conformance/2002/ unchanged.
