      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 - the LEGAL placements of the data-description clauses the clause-placement screen
      *> governs (kb/Work PB507 / PB512 / PB518 / PB519), each at the edition that introduced it (all 85-era):
      *>   F-REC  GLOBAL on a level-1 FILE SECTION record - 13.18.27.3 SR1 b) admits "a data description entry
      *>          whose level-number is 1 that is specified in the file, working-storage, local-storage, or
      *>          linkage section". Before the screen the registration scan never read the FILE SECTION, so the
      *>          contained program's reference to F-REC was UNDEFINED (COBOLNET1639) - legal source rejected.
      *>   W-GLB  GLOBAL on a level-1 working-storage entry (13.16.3 SR6 / SR7).
      *>   X-ANC  EXTERNAL on the redefines ANCHOR (13.16.3 SR5 forbids it only on the entry that ALSO says
      *>          REDEFINES). 13.18.22.4 GR1: the record is external, and X-RED shares its storage, so the value
      *>          stored through X-RED is the one PB518CLX sees through its own X-ANC.
      *>   N-BWZ  BLANK WHEN ZERO on an elementary numeric display item without 'S' (13.18.8.3 SR1/SR2); a zero
      *>          store sets it to all spaces (13.18.8.4 GR1).
      *>   A-JUS  JUSTIFIED on an elementary alphanumeric item (13.18.32.3 SR1/SR3); "AB" is right-justified
      *>          into five positions, space-filled on the left.
      *> Expected, derived from the rules above: W=GLB R=FILREC / X=1234 / N=[   ] J=[   AB]
