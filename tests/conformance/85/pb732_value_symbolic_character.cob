*> kb/Work PB732 POSITIVE TWIN at COBOL-85 — the constant entry (ISO 13.10) is a COBOL-2002 element, so
*> at 85 the ONLY word a VALUE literal position admits is a symbolic-character: 8.3.3.6.2 Format 7 with
*> 8.3.3.6.3 SR4 ("Symbolic-character-1 shall be specified in the SYMBOLIC CHARACTERS clause of the
*> SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph"), whose integer-1 is the ORDINAL POSITION in the native character set
*> (12.3.7.4 GR11) - 66 is 'A'. Both spellings: the bare figurative (length 1, 8.3.3.6.4 GR3 b) and the
*> ALL form (repeated to the receiving size, GR2). The rejection PB732 landed must not reach these.
