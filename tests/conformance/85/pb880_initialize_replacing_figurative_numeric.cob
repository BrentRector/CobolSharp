      *> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.20.4 GR4: "Otherwise, the implicit statement is: MOVE sending-operand TO
      *> receiving-operand." INITIALIZE G REPLACING NUMERIC DATA BY SPACE is therefore MOVE SPACE TO N for the
      *> numeric item N - permitted through ISO 2014 (14.9.25.3 SR5 removed it in 2023; Annex E.2 item 1), and
      *> stored as the explicit MOVE stores it: three space characters in N's character positions (the
      *> pre-removal fill semantics - MOVE SPACE TO PIC 9(3) leaves "   ").
      *> kb/Work PB880: the implicit MOVE was built by the EMITTER, after the bind-time pass that gives N the
      *> image-backed storage a character fill needs, so this ABORTED the run unit ("without image-backed
      *> storage") at every edition. The move is bound now. The explicit twin at the end is the control: both
      *> forms must print the same thing, and N2 is touched ONLY by INITIALIZE so no other statement can have
      *> supplied the storage fact.
