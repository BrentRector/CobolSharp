       PROGRAM-ID. PB668R8.
      *> kb/Work PB668. OPEN INPUT ... REVERSED is the COBOL-85 tape
      *> phrase ISO 2002 deleted (VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE row 7.12,
      *> gate open-reversed-removed-2002 / COBOLNET0902), so this is a
      *> --std 85 golden and its negative at 2002+ is that gate's.
      *> Before PB668 the phrase parsed, the edition gate admitted it at
      *> 85, and NO binder read it: the READs below answered AAAAAAAA,
      *> BBBBBBBB, CCCCCCCC - the FORWARD order - with no diagnostic.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, COMPUTED FROM THE RULE, NOT MEASURED. The
      *> phrase positions the file at its END and every subsequent READ
      *> makes the PRECEDING record available; that direction is the one
      *> 14.9.30.4 GR21 c) already defines ("the first existing record
      *> in the physical file whose relative key number is ... less than
      *> the file position indicator if PREVIOUS is specified"), and
      *> GR21 e) ("If no record is found that satisfies the above rules,
      *> the at end condition exists") is the at end at the FIRST
      *> record, which 14.9.30.4 GR24 reports as '10'. So a three-record
      *> file read REVERSED yields CCCCCCCC, BBBBBBBB, AAAAAAAA and then
      *> AT END. The OPEN itself is an ordinary successful open: '00'
      *> (9.1.13.2 item 1) - REVERSED is a positioning, not a status
      *> overlay, unlike its sibling WITH NO REWIND whose 14.9.27.4 GR11
      *> '07' pb317_open_no_rewind_85 pins.
      *>
      *> The RE-OPEN at the end is the lifetime witness: the phrase
      *> belongs to the OPEN statement that wrote it, so a plain re-open
      *> of the same connector reads FORWARD again (AAAAAAAA). Without
      *> SequentialConnector.OpenCore clearing the flag this reads
      *> CCCCCCCC and nothing else in the suite would notice.
