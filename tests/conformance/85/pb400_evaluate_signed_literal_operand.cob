      *> ISO §14.9.13.4 GR1 — "If an operand of the EVALUATE statement consists of a
      *> single literal, that operand is treated as a literal, not as an expression" —
      *> read with §8.3.3.3.2 rule 2 — "A literal shall not contain more than one sign
      *> character.  If a sign is used, it shall appear as the leftmost character of the
      *> literal."  A literal is one contiguous character-string, so `-5` CONSISTS OF a
      *> single literal while the SEPARATED `- 5` is a unary operator applied to one and
      *> is an arithmetic expression.  The sign is the only difference between the two,
      *> and it changes the Table-15 column (kb/Work PB400: the signed form was
      *> classified as an expression on both sides).
      *>
      *> What that literal then MEANS against an alphanumeric operand is §8.8.4.2.5:
      *> "The integer operand is treated as though it were moved, according to the rules
      *> of the MOVE statement, to an elementary data item of the same length in terms
      *> of character positions as the number of digits in the integer, and of the same
      *> class and usage as the alphanumeric or national operand" — and §14.9.25.4 GR6a
      *> governs that move: "If the sending operand is described as being signed
      *> numeric, the operational sign is not moved."  So `-5` participates as the ONE
      *> character "5", never as the two characters "-5"; §8.8.4.2.7 then space-extends
      *> the shorter operand.  The two MOVE lines at the end are the same rule stated
      *> directly, and they must agree with each other: a signed LITERAL and a signed
      *> ITEM of the same value move identically.
