      *> kb/Work PB416 — the POSITIVE side of the four §14.9.20.3 screens INITIALIZE never asked, at COBOL-85,
      *> where every one of the four rules already applies (INITIALIZE, its REPLACING phrase and the five classic
      *> category names are all COBOL-85; the negatives are tests/conformance/negative/pb416-*).
      *>
      *> A screen is only as good as what it still ADMITS, so this file is the over-rejection witness for all
      *> four: SR1 (identifier-1's class), SR4 (the implied MOVE's validity), SR5 (no RENAMES on identifier-1)
      *> and SR7 (identifier-1 is the receiving operand, and therefore subject to the receiving-operand
      *> prohibitions). The negative witnesses are five files under tests/conformance/negative/.

      *> EXPECTED, DERIVED FROM THE STANDARD BEFORE THE RUN:
      *>   T1  INITIALIZE G REPLACING <five '85 categories>. §14.9.20.3 SR4's second paragraph admits every one
      *>       of these pairs, because §14.9.25.3 Table 16 marks each "Yes":
      *>         ALPHABETIC          BY "Q"    — Alphanumeric row x Alphabetic column      -> AB = "Q  "
      *>         ALPHANUMERIC        BY "pqr"  — Alphanumeric row x Alphanumeric column    -> AN = "pqr"
      *>         ALPHANUMERIC-EDITED BY "mn"   — Alphanumeric row x Alphanumeric column    -> AE = "mn   "
      *>                                         (PIC XXBXX: data positions 1,2,4,5 take "mn" then space fill,
      *>                                          the B inserts a space at position 3 — §13.18.40.4 GR3 c)
      *>         NUMERIC             BY 42     — Numeric/Integer row x Numeric column      -> NU = 042
      *>         NUMERIC-EDITED      BY 9      — Numeric/Integer row x Numeric column      -> NE = "   9"
      *>       IX is USAGE INDEX and is SUBORDINATE to identifier-1, so §14.9.20.4 GR5a1 excludes it from the
      *>       receiver set SILENTLY — that exclusion is NOT SR1 and must keep its silence; SR1 is a rule about
      *>       identifier-1 itself.
      *>   T2  the bare COBOL-85 form (GR5c4 + GR6c's fill table): SPACES for the three character categories
      *>       (alphabetic, alphanumeric, alphanumeric-edited) and ZEROES for numeric; the numeric-edited
      *>       receiver takes the figurative ZERO through the ordinary MOVE editing path, PIC ZZZ9 suppressing
      *>       the leading zeros -> "   0".
      *>   T3  identifier-1 of CLASS NUMERIC — one of the eight classes SR1 admits (§8.5.2.1 Table 2). -> 0000
      *>   T4  identifier-1 of CLASS ALPHABETIC — likewise admitted; GR6c fills it with SPACES. -> "    "
      *>   T5  identifier-1 that is a level-01 group with a level-66 RENAMES entry BESIDE it. SR5 forbids a
      *>       RENAMES clause in the data description entry of identifier-1, and REC's entry has none — the
      *>       66 entry is a separate entry, not storage subordinate to REC (§13.18.45), so REC is initialized
      *>       whole and the rule does not reach it.
