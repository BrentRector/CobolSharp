      *> ISO §14.2.3 GR1 — Format 1: execution skips the declaratives,

      *> of the procedure division, excluding declaratives. Statements
      *> are then executed in the order in which they are presented for
      *> compilation, except where the rules indicate some other order."

      *> Format 1 (14.2.1) lets a section hold zero sentences and lets
      *> sentences precede the section's first paragraph.
      *> DERIVATION of every output line:
      *>  The textually first statement (DISPLAY "DECL") is in the
      *>  declaratives, so it is excluded; no I-O error ever occurs, so
      *>  the USE procedure never runs and DECL never prints.
      *>  E-SEC is empty, so the first statement of the procedure
      *>  division is the unnamed sentence opening Z-SEC: "1 Z-SEC".
      *>  Presentation order then runs Y-PARA ("2 Y-PARA"), falls into
      *>  the next section A-SEC and its paragraphs X-PARA ("3 X-PARA")
      *>  and B-PARA ("4 B-PARA"), which ends the run. Names are chosen
      *>  in reverse alphabetic order so that no order but presentation
      *>  order yields 1, 2, 3, 4.
