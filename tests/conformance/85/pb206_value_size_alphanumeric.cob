      *> ISO 13.18.63.3 SR4 - "If the item is of category alphabetic,
      *> alphanumeric, or alphanumeric-edited literals in the VALUE
      *> clause shall be alphanumeric literals.  Alphanumeric literals
      *> in the VALUE clause of an elementary item shall not exceed the
      *> size indicated by an explicit PICTURE clause.  Alphanumeric
      *> literals in the VALUE clause of an alphanumeric group item
      *> shall not exceed the size of the group item."
      *>
      *> THE CONFORMING HALF of kb/Work PB206.  BOTH size sentences had
      *> NO implementation anywhere in the compiler while their national
      *> (SR5) and boolean (SR10) twins had theirs, so both silently
      *> TRUNCATED: measured on 1d949007, `01 E1 PIC X(2) VALUE "ABCD".`
      *> displayed AB and `01 GZ VALUE "ABCDEF". 05 O1 PIC X(2).
      *> 05 O2 PIC X(2).` displayed ABCD, neither with a diagnostic.
      *> They are now COBOLNET1740 (negative fixtures
      *> pb206-value-oversize-elementary, pb206-group-value-oversize).
      *> A screen that also OVER-rejected would pass both of those, so
      *> THIS program pins the population the rule admits.
      *>
      *> EE / GE - the BOUNDARY.  The rule is "shall not EXCEED", so a
      *>   literal of exactly the size is conforming; an off-by-one
      *>   screen would reject these.
      *> ES - a SHORTER literal.  GR7 aligns it per 14.6.8
      *>   (left-justified, space fill), it is not a violation.
      *> GA / EA - `ALL "literal"` is a FIGURATIVE constant (8.3.3.6.2
      *>   format 6), not an alphanumeric literal, and 8.3.3.6.4 GR2 -
      *>   the branch for "the length of the string is specified in the
      *>   rules for the context", which names the VALUE clause - says
      *>   it "is repeated character by character until the size of the
      *>   resultant string is greater than or equal to the number of
      *>   character positions in the associated data item" and is then
      *>   "truncated from the right".  So a 3-character literal-1 over
      *>   4 positions is CONFORMING SOURCE seeding XYZX, and the size
      *>   screen must not measure it.  This is the arm a naive
      *>   `decoded length > size` screen breaks.
      *> GZ - the same rule for a figurative WORD: one character
      *>   (8.3.3.6.4 GR1 - the value of '0' in the runtime coded
      *>   character set) repeated to the group's four positions.
      *> 13.18.63.4 GR5 gives the group answers: the area is
      *> initialized "without consideration for the individual
      *> elementary or group items contained within this group", so the
      *> characters land positionally and each member is whatever its
      *> own description makes of the characters under it.
