      * kb/Work PB873 - a SIGNED numeric argument crossing into a
      * separately-compiled program whose formal sees it as characters.
      * ISO 14.2.3 GR8: "If the argument is passed by reference, the
      * activated runtime element operates as if the formal parameter
      * occupies the same storage area as the argument."  GR9 (first
      * branch - no program-specifier, no NESTED phrase): the BY CONTENT
      * record is "of the same length as the argument" and the argument
      * is moved into it "without conversion".  So the formal sees the
      * argument's STORAGE - its operational sign included.
      * GR11: "references to data-name-1 ... are resolved in accordance
      * with their description in the linkage section" - LR is PIC
      * S9(4)V99, so LR is NEGATIVE and SUBTRACT 1 gives -13.34.
      * Sign characters: trailing over-punch, the documented IBM
      * convention (CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-177): -4 is "M", -3 "L".
      * Derived:
      *   -12.34 in S9(4)V99 storage = 00123M (both arms)
      *   BY REFERENCE: LR - 1 = -13.34 -> the caller's SM = 00133M
      *   BY CONTENT: the callee's store never reaches SM - 00133M
      *   SIGN LEADING SEPARATE -123 is the 4 characters "-123"; a
      *   PIC X(4) formal sees them, and its MOVE "+124" is the
      *   caller's storage (GR8) - SL then holds +124.
