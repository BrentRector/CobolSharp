      *> THE 85 COMPLEMENT of the A.4.14 / A.4.3 declines: every word the new declined-facility grammar
      *> tokenizes is a legal USER-DEFINED WORD at COBOL-85, and adding a lexer token for it must not change
      *> that. DESTINATION is 8.9-reserved at every edition and so is NOT here; VALIDATE-STATUS, VAL-STATUS,
      *> VALID and FORMAT are "added 2002"; APPLY, NONE and RELATION are 8.10 context-sensitive and never
      *> 8.9-reserved. 13.18.62.3 SR9 makes VAL-STATUS and VALIDATE-STATUS equivalent WORDS, an edition-level
      *> reservation that survives the module decline - "DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT on the equivalence rule" is
      *> not a licence to drop the words, and this fixture is what would catch that regression.
