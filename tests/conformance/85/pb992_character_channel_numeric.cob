      *> kb/Work PB992 - a numeric USAGE DISPLAY item that a CHARACTER CHANNEL writes holds the characters it is
      *> given, whatever they are. Three channels, each derived from the standard before measuring:
      *>
      *> (1) ISO 14.9.25.4 GR4 (cite.py --check 14.9.25.4 "Any move that is not an elementary move, and does
      *>     not reference a variable-length group, is treated exactly as if it were an alphanumeric to
      *>     alphanumeric elementary move, except that there is no conversion of data from one form of internal
      *>     representation to another" -> OK 14.9.25.4 4)). MOVE G TO H stores G's characters into H unconverted.
      *> (2) ISO 14.2.3 GR8 (cite.py --check 14.2.3 "occupies the same storage area as the argument" -> OK
      *>     14.2.3 8)) with 14.8.2.3.2 rule 1 (cite.py --check 14.8.2.3.2 "the formal parameter shall be of the
      *>     same length as the corresponding argument" -> OK 14.8.2.3.2 1)): a Format-1 CALL pairs a numeric
      *>     argument with a PIC X(3) formal of the same length, and the formal's store IS the argument's store.
      *> (3) The same GR8 read the other way: a PIC X(3) argument's characters ARE the numeric formal's content.
      *>
      *> DERIVED VALUES (none depends on how the compiler keeps the item):
      *>   H=[   ]      three spaces - GR4 moves the group's characters, no conversion.
      *>   S=[12AB]     the four characters of G2, no conversion - a SIGNED item is no exception.
      *>   H NOT NUMERIC  spaces are not digits (the NUMERIC class test).
      *>   A=[   ]      the callee moved SPACES into its PIC X(3) formal, which occupies A's storage.
      *>   N=[ABC]      the callee's PIC 9(3) formal occupies the storage of the PIC X(3) argument C.
      *>   K=0015 / K+1=0016   an ordinary numeric crossing still computes: 10 + 5, then ADD 1.
      *> Before PB992 H, A and N displayed 000 and S displayed 012B - a native carrier held a VALUE decoded
      *> from the characters, never the characters themselves.
