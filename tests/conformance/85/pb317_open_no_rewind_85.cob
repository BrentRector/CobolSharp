      *> edition gate: the phrase is in the OPEN general format of every
      *> edition this compiler targets, and VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE row

      *> at --std 85, so a future gate on the phrase breaks HERE and not
      *> only in the 2023 corpus. Expected values are computed exactly
      *> as they are for 2023/pb317_open_no_rewind: '07' from GR11 plus
      *> 9.1.13.2 item 6 on the category (a) Non-unit medium, '00' where
      *> no phrase is written (9.1.13.2 item 1), and AAAAAAAA because an
      *> IGNORED phrase leaves 14.9.27.4 GR14's file position indicator
      *> of 1 exactly as a plain OPEN INPUT does.
