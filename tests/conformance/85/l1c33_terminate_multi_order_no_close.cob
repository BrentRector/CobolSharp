      *> ISO §14.9.46.4 GR4/GR6 — multi-name TERMINATE order; no CLOSE
      *> General format §14.9.46.2: TERMINATE { report-name-1 } ...
      *>   cite.py: OK  §14.9.46.2   (General format)
      *> GR4 sentence 1: "The result of executing a TERMINATE statement
      *> in which more than one report-name-1 is specified is as though
      *> a separate TERMINATE statement had been executed for each
      *> report-name-1 in the same order as specified in the statement."
      *>   cite.py: OK  §14.9.46.4 4)  (General rules)
      *> GR6: "The TERMINATE statement does not close the file
      *> associated with report-name-1."
      *>   cite.py: OK  §14.9.46.4 6)  (General rules)
      *> Supporting: §14.9.46.4 GR3 c) "The report footing is printed,
      *> if defined." (cite.py: OK  §14.9.46.4 3) c)) - each report
      *> had a GENERATE, so each TERMINATE prints its RF; §14.9.49.4
      *> GR8 "The declarative is invoked just before the named report
      *> group is produced" (cite.py: OK  §14.9.49.4 8)) - the USE
      *> BEFORE REPORTING declaratives make each RF's production order
      *> visible on DISPLAY.
      *> DERIVATION. R-A is declared first, R-B second; the statement
      *> names them R-B R-A. GR4: TERMINATE R-B runs first, so RF-B's
      *> declarative prints "RF-B" before "RF-A". (An implementation
      *> terminating in declaration order, or in reverse written order,
      *> prints RF-A first.) GR6: both files are still open, so the
      *> later INITIATE R-A / GENERATE / TERMINATE R-A works and prints
      *> "RF-A" again, and CLOSE of each file succeeds with status 00
      *> (a CLOSE of a file that TERMINATE had closed would give 42).
      *> EDITION: Report Writer, USE BEFORE REPORTING and FILE STATUS
      *> are all COBOL-85.
