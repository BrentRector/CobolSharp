      *> kb/Work PB664 - THE POSITIVE CONTROL FOR ISO 14.9.43.3 SR1 AND 14.9.48.3 SR2.  The fix those rules
      *> needed is a REJECTION (a class-pointer / COMP / index / numeric-literal operand of STRING or UNSTRING
      *> was accepted and rendered the CLR carrier's type name), and the failure mode of a rejection is that it
      *> reaches source the rule ADMITS.  Every leg below is a spelling the rules admit, and each one names the
      *> clause that admits it.
      *>
      *> ISO 14.9.43.3 SR1 - "All literals shall be described as alphanumeric, boolean, or national literals,
      *>   and all identifiers, EXCEPT identifier-4, shall be described implicitly or explicitly as usage
      *>   display or national."  Identifier-4 is the WITH POINTER item: leg 1 makes it USAGE BINARY on purpose,
      *>   so the exemption is WITNESSED rather than assumed - a screen that over-reached would reject leg 1.
      *> ISO 14.9.43.3 SR7 - identifier-4 "shall be described as an elementary numeric integer data item of
      *>   sufficient size to contain a value equal to 1 plus the size of the data item referenced by
      *>   identifier-3"; PIC 9(4) COMP is one.
      *> ISO 14.9.43.3 SR8 - "Where identifier-1 or identifier-2 is an elementary numeric data item, it shall be
      *>   described as an integer without the symbol 'P' in its picture character-string" - so a usage-DISPLAY
      *>   numeric sender (leg 2) is admitted by SR1 and constrained by SR8, never refused.
      *> ISO 14.9.43.4 GR3 a) - the characters are transferred "in accordance with the MOVE statement rules for
      *>   alphanumeric-to-alphanumeric moves ... except that no space filling is provided"; b) transfer stops
      *>   at the delimiter and "the character(s) specified by literal-2 ... are not transferred".
      *> ISO 14.9.43.4 GR6 - identifier-4 "was increased by one prior to the move of the next character".
      *> ISO 14.9.48.3 SR2 - "Identifier-1, identifier-2, identifier-3, and identifier-5 shall reference data
      *>   items of category alphanumeric or national" - leg 5's sender and delimiter are both alphanumeric.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE SPEC:
      *>   L1  A4 = "AB C" delimited by D1 (one space): "AB" lands at position 1 and identifier-4 ends at
      *>       1 + 2 = 3, so OUT1 = "AB" + 28 spaces and PTR4 = 0003.
      *>   L2  a usage-display NUMERIC sender, DELIMITED BY SIZE: its three digit characters, OUT1 = "123".
      *>   L3  a GROUP sender - usage is an elementary property, so SR1's usage test does not reach it and the
      *>       group's own characters go: OUT1 = "XYZ9".
      *>   L4  a NUMERIC-EDITED sender, usage display: its edited image (13.18.63.3 SR7 gives PIC ZZ9
      *>       the image " 42" as the programmer wrote it), so OUT1 = " 42".  SR5 bars an edited item only as identifier-3.
      *>   L5  UNSTRING "AB C" delimited by " " into two PIC X(4) receivers: "AB  " and "C   ".
      *>
      *> EDITIONS: STRING and UNSTRING are complete at COBOL-85 and SR1/SR2 are unchanged since, so this file
      *> lives at the introducing edition and the corpus keeps ONE copy.  The negatives are
      *> tests/conformance/negative/pb664-string-sender-usage, -string-numeric-literal (both reject at every
      *> edition) and -string-sender-pointer, -unstring-sender-pointer (2002+, where USAGE POINTER exists).
