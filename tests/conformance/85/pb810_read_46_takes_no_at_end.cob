      *> THE DETERMINATION (kb/Work PB810). GR24's actions are
      *> conditioned on the at end condition, and '46' is not it: it is
      *> a LOGIC ERROR (§9.1.13.7 6)). So §14.9.30.4 GR13 governs --
      *> the AT END and NOT AT END phrases are ignored, and GR13 b)
      *> transfers control
      *> through §9.1.12 to the applicable USE declarative, then to the
      *> end of the READ.
      *>
      *> WHY EACH LEG CAN FAIL. The first READ of each empty file is the
      *> at end condition ('10') and MUST take AT END. The second READ
      *> (and, for RLF, the READ after an unsuccessful START) MUST set
      *> '46', run the declarative once, and print neither the AT END
      *> nor the NOT AT END line -- an emitter that treated every
      *> unsuccessful status as at end prints "AT-END 46", and one that
      *> treated it as success prints "NAE". The three organizations
      *> reach the READ through two different emitter arms (sequential,
      *> and relative/indexed), so each is pinned separately.
