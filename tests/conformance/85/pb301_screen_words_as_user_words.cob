      *> kb/Work PB301 - THE SCREEN SURFACE MUST NOT COST THE USER A WORD. Annex A.4.2 (screen handling) is a
      *> DECLINED optional module (docs/CONFORMANCE.md 5), and this compiler declines it by tokenizing the
      *> module's words so the refusal can name itself (COBOLNET1560 / COBOLNET1707) instead of drawing a raw
      *> parse error. A lexer token is not a reservation: ISO 8.3.2.1 rule 3 - "Context-sensitive words may be
      *> used as user-defined words and system-names in contexts other than the language construct in which
      *> they are defined" - so the fifteen 8.10 screen words below are legal user-defined words at EVERY
      *> edition, and 8.9 adds COL, COLS, COLUMNS, CRT, CURSOR and SCREEN only in 2002, which leaves those six
      *> legal COBOL-85 user words too. All twenty-one are declared and REFERENCED here; the reference matters
      *> as much as the declaration, because the reservation gate withdraws a word from `cobolWord` while
      *> `reservedGatedWord` still admits it in the DEFINITION slot, so a program that only declared would not
      *> notice a half-applied gate.
      *> COLUMN is deliberately absent: 8.9 reserves it at every edition (the report-writer COLUMN clause), so
      *> it is barred by 8.3.2.1 rule 1 - tests/conformance/negative/pb301-column-reserved-at-every-edition.
      *> UNDERLINE is declared as a TABLE so the subscript-trigger half of the cobol-words.json row is exercised:
      *> `UNDERLINE (2)` must enter the lexer's SUBSCRIPT mode, which only happens for a word in _dataNameTokens.
