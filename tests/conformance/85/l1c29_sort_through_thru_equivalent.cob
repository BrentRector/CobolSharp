      *> ISO §14.9.40.3 SR7 — THROUGH and THRU name the same SORT procedure range
      *> Rule (§14.9.40.3 SR7): "The words THROUGH and THRU are equivalent."
      *> cite.py --check 14.9.40.3 "The words THROUGH and THRU are equivalent"
      *>   -> OK  §14.9.40.3 7)  (Syntax rules)
      *> Format 1 (§14.9.40.2) prints { THROUGH | THRU } in BOTH the INPUT
      *> PROCEDURE and the OUTPUT PROCEDURE phrase. Two SORTs over the same
      *> three-paragraph ranges: SORT 1 writes INPUT ... THROUGH and OUTPUT
      *> ... THRU; SORT 2 swaps the spellings. Each range has a MIDDLE
      *> paragraph, so a spelling that bound only the first or only the
      *> named paragraphs would drop records or the MID line.
      *> Derivation:
      *>  Input range IP-A..IP-B releases C/IPA1, D/IPM1, A/IPB1, B/IPB2
      *>  (all three paragraphs execute under either spelling, SR7).
      *>  SORT 1 ASCENDING on SK -> A B C D; OP-A returns the first
      *>  record ("S1 FIRST AIPB1"), OP-M prints "S1 MID", OP-B returns
      *>  the rest in order. SORT 2 DESCENDING -> D C B A, same shape
      *>  tagged S2. Keys are all distinct, so GR4 (undefined order of
      *>  equal keys) never applies.
