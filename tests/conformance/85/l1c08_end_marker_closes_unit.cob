      *>       program-name is that of a program that does not possess
      *>       the common attribute and that is directly contained
      *>       within another program, that program-name may be

      *> of X shows which unit the statement belongs to.
      *> DERIVATION OF EVERY EXPECTED LINE:
      *> D X=DDDD   C calls D (directly contained, 8.4.6.3 1)); D's
      *>            reference to X is to D's own X.
      *> E X=EEEE   END PROGRAM L1C08D ended D (GR1), so E is NOT
      *>            contained in D but directly contained in C; C's CALL
      *>            of E is therefore legal and runs E, whose X is E's.
      *> F X=FFFF   END PROGRAM L1C08C ended C (GR1), so F is a separate
      *>            program, callable by C, with its own X.
      *> C X=OUTER  back in C after the calls: C's own X is untouched.
