      *> kb/Work PB1029 - the LEGAL neighbours of the operand refusals that used to compile silently
      *> and abort the run unit. ISO 14.9.43.3 SR2 bars only a figurative constant that BEGINS WITH
      *> THE WORD ALL; a plain figurative is legal and "refers to an implicit one character data
      *> item" (14.9.43.4 GR2), so STRING "AB" SPACE "CD" writes AB CD into the first five positions
      *> and leaves the rest of WS-A as it was. ISO 14.9.22.3 SR3 likewise lets an INSPECT literal be
      *> a figurative (one character) but not an ALL figurative: FOR ALL SPACE tallies the two
      *> spaces of "AB  CD".
