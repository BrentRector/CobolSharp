      *> kb/Work PB704 - `SORT ... WITH DUPLICATES IN ORDER` (ISO 14.9.40.2). ORDER is the phrase's own
      *> word, not a name: it rode `cobolWord`, and the 8.9 funnel - which screens every IDENTIFIER
      *> occurrence POSITION-BLIND - answered `'ORDER' is a reserved word ... and cannot be used as a
      *> user-defined word` at every edition from 2002 (8.9 reserves ORDER since 2002). The phrase is the
      *> ONLY way a program can demand 14.9.40.4 GR3's defined order for records equal on every key, so the
      *> workaround was a program whose result GR4 leaves UNDEFINED. ORDER is now a lexer token with a
      *> cobol-words.json nameSlot row (the FORMAT precedent), so the phrase parses at every edition and
      *> `01 ORDER PIC X.` still draws COBOLNET0901 at 2002+.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE SPEC AND NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>   14.9.40.4 GR8 a) - ASCENDING, so the record with the LOWER key is returned first: every A
      *>                      before every B.
      *>   14.9.40.4 GR3 b) - among records whose key data items are all equal, the order of return is
      *>                      "the order in which these records are released by an input procedure".
      *>                      IN-PROC releases B1 A1 B2 A2 B3 A3, so the A group returns A1 A2 A3 and the
      *>                      B group B1 B2 B3.
      *> Hence OUT=A1 A2 A3 B1 B2 B3, then DONE. Without the DUPLICATES phrase GR4 makes that order
      *> undefined, which is exactly what this phrase buys and what the rejection took away.
