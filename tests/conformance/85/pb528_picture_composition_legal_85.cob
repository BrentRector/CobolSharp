      *> kb/Work PB528 - THE DRIFT TEST OVER THE LEGAL SHAPES. Closing the 13.18.40.3 composition gap means
      *> writing down prohibitions, and a prohibition written one symbol too wide REJECTS LEGAL SOURCE, which
      *> is worse than the under-rejection it replaces. Every entry here is a shape the standard permits and
      *> the validator must keep permitting; each is MOVEd through and DISPLAYed, so a wrong ACCEPT/REJECT and
      *> a wrong RENDER are both visible. The composition rules are syntax rules of every edition from 1985,
      *> so 85 is the sharpest edition to pin them at.
      *>
      *> L01 ZZ9 with 12 - 13.18.40.5 rule 7 a: the replacement character (space, for 'Z') goes into every
      *>     position preceding the first nonzero numeric character. The value in three digit positions is
      *>     012, so position 1 is a leading zero and position 2 is the first nonzero => " 12".
      *> L02 99PP with 1200 - 13.18.40.4 GR14 'P': the assumed point is "to the right of the string of 'P's
      *>     if they indicate the rightmost digit positions", and 'P' "is not counted in the size of the
      *>     item". Two stored digits, scale -2, algebraic value 12 x 10^2 => "12".
      *> L03 PP99 with 0.0012 - the same rule's other leg: the point is to the LEFT of a leftmost 'P' string,
      *>     so the scale is 4 and the two stored digits are 12 => "12".
      *> L04 S999 SIGN IS LEADING SEPARATE with -12 - SR18's legal shape; 13.18.52 puts the sign in its own
      *>     leading position => "-012".
      *> L05 99PPV with 1200 - SR19's "immediately follow the last symbol 'P'" leg; the V restates the point
      *>     GR14 already implies, so the image is L02's => "12".
      *> L06 VPP99 with 0.0012 - SR19's "immediately precede the first symbol 'P'" leg => "12".
      *> L07 ***9 with 7 - rule 7's asterisk replacement over the leading zeros of 0007 => "***7".
      *> L08 $999+ with -12 - SR26's "leftmost symbol" currency leg beside a trailing sign; Table 8 renders a
      *>     '+' over a negative value as '-' => "$012-".
      *> L09 $$$9.99 with 12.34 - rule 6 a floating insertion: a single '$' immediately precedes the first
      *>     nonzero numeric character, spaces before it. Three '$' give two digit positions, plus the '9'
      *>     and the two fraction digits; 012.34 suppresses the leading 0 => " $12.34".
      *> L10 +$$99 with 12 - SR26's "optionally preceded by one of the symbols '+' or '-'". The two '$' are a
      *>     floating string (one digit position); 012 suppresses the leading 0 and floats the '$' => "+ $12".
      *> L11 999$+ with -12 - SR26's rightmost-currency leg, "optionally followed by one of '+', '-', 'CR' or
      *>     'DB'" => "012$-".
      *> L12 ++ with 1 - SR12 a's second bullet made concrete: two occurrences of '+' ARE a picture, and rule
      *>     6 makes them a floating string of one digit position => "+1".
      *> L13 999.99CR with -12.34 - Table 8: 'CR' over a negative value renders CR => "012.34CR".
      *> L14 ZZZ,ZZ9.99 with 1234.5 - rule 7's "Any of the simple insertion editing symbols embedded in this
      *>     string ... are part of the string": the comma is inside the suppression string => "  1,234.50".
      *> L15 XXBXX with "ABCD" - rule 3 simple insertion of the space => "AB CD".
      *> L16 9,999 with 1234 => "1,234".
      *> L17 -999 with -12 - Table 8's '-' over a negative value => "-012".
      *> L18 999- with -12 => "012-".
      *> L19 9V9 with 1.2 - category numeric; 'V' is not counted in the size => "12".
      *> L20 $$$$PP - DECLARED ONLY, because it is the shape SR16 is measured against: its digit positions are
      *>     the FLOATING CURRENCY occurrences plus the 'P's (13.18.40.4 GR14), so the 'P' string really is at
      *>     the rightmost digit positions even though no '9', 'Z' or '*' appears (kb/Work PB155).
      *> L21 S9(5) - SR18 with a repeat factor, the shape PB528's SR22 leg pairs with.
