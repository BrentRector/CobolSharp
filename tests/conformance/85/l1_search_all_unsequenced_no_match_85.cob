      *> ISO §14.9.37.4 GR6 b) at COBOL-85 — the edition-invariant half.
      *> Same shape as the 2023 witness: the OCCURS clause declares
      *> ASCENDING KEY IS WS-K and the program stores 09, 07, 05, 03,
      *> 01, so GR5 a) is violated and GR6 governs; no occurrence holds
      *> 04, so GR6 b) is the branch, and execution proceeds as in
      *> GR1b — the AT END phrase is taken and control then reaches the
      *> end of the SEARCH statement.
      *> The exception-condition half of GR6b is not observable at this
      *> edition (the EC model and the TURN directive are COBOL-2002
      *> additions), so only the control-flow half is asserted here.
