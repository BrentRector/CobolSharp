      *> ISO §14.9.49.3 SR4 (kb/Work PB362): "Procedure-names within a
      *> declarative section may be referenced in a different declarative
      *> section or in a nondeclarative procedure only with a PERFORM
      *> statement." The LEGAL half of the boundary, executed:
      *>   1. PERFORM DP1 THRU DP2 from the nondeclarative portion. DP1's
      *>      GO TO DP2 is a reference WITHIN its own section, which SR4
      *>      does not restrict. §14.9.28.4 runs DP2's ADD, then control
      *>      returns at the end of DP2: N = 1.
      *>   2. PERFORM D1 (the section): DP1, GO TO DP2, ADD: N = 2.
      *>   3. PERFORM DP3, a paragraph of declarative section D2, whose
      *>      PERFORM DP2 references a DIFFERENT declarative section by
      *>      PERFORM, the one statement SR4 admits: N = 3.
      *> The refused half (a GO TO into a declarative section from outside
      *> it) is conformance:negative/pb362-goto-into-declarative.
      *> EDITION: SR4 is COBOL-85's USE syntax rule, unchanged in 2023.
