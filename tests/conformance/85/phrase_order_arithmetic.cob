      *> ISO 5.2.6.4 — the ON SIZE ERROR / NOT ON SIZE ERROR pair is enclosed in CHOICE INDICATORS in every
      *> arithmetic statement's printed general format, so BOTH phrases may be written, each at most once,
      *> IN ANY ORDER. This golden pins the REVERSED order (NOT-then-ON) for all five arithmetic statements
      *> and proves each phrase still binds to its own role: the non-overflowing case must take the NOT
      *> branch, the overflowing case must take the ON branch.
      *> Regression guard for the defect fixed 2026-07-19 (DEVLOG 927): the grammar admitted only ON-then-NOT,
      *> so every line below was rejected with COBOL0001 "no viable alternative at input 'ON'".
