      *> kb/Work PB367 - a USE procedure is the whole remainder of its declarative section, at
      *> --std 85. The full derivation is in tests/conformance/2023/pb367_use_procedure_is_the_
      *> section.cob; this is the 85 WITNESS, because the rule is edition-INDEPENDENT: 14.9.49.3

      *> clean at 85 while asserting the same rule.
