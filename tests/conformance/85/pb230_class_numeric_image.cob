      *> PB230 - ISO 8.8.4.4.4 GR3 n)1: the NUMERIC class condition over a numeric item whose storage is a
      *> CHARACTER WINDOW (a REDEFINES view), keyed on the item's USAGE.  A native-carrier numeric leaf folds to
      *> true at compile time (it can only hold digits); only a window can hold content that fails the test, and
      *> the rule the window is tested against is the item's own byte representation:
      *>   n)1.a (DISPLAY) "the presence or absence of an operational sign in the content ... is in agreement with
      *>          the data description ... and ... the content, except for the operational sign, consists entirely
      *>          of the characters 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9";
      *>   n)1.c (every other fixed-point usage) "the content ... consists entirely of a valid representation for
      *>          the usage and, if a PICTURE clause is specified, the numeric value is within the range of values
      *>          implied by the PICTURE clause".
      *> This is the SAME predicate 14.6.13.2 rule 2 tests a sending operand against ("would evaluate to false in
      *> a numeric class condition"), so it is written once and both callers ask it.
      *> DERIVATIONS for the four NO answers.  Zoned "AB1": A and B are not among 0-9 (n)1.a).  Signed S9(3)
      *> holding "1AB": with the DISPLAY default of a TRAILING over-punch (13.18.52), position 3 must be a digit
      *> or an over-punch character and "B" is one - but position 2, "A", is not a digit, so the test fails on the
      *> non-sign position.  Packed PIC 9(3) COMP-3 holding X"5A5A": the digit nibbles are 5, A and 5, and A is
      *> not a decimal digit, so the bytes are not a valid packed representation (n)1.c first half).  Binary
      *> PIC 9(3) COMP holding X"5A5A": every two's-complement pattern IS a valid binary representation, but the
      *> value 23130 is outside 0..999, the range the PICTURE implies (n)1.c second half).
