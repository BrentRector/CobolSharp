      *>   Line 2: pseudo-text-2 spans three source lines. Its words
      *>     "MULTI-" and "LINE" are separated only by the space assumed
      *>     at the end of a line (NOTE 2); they stay two operands, so
      *>     DISPLAY prints MULTI-LINE.
      *>   Line 3: a literal is ONE text-word, so no space may be added
      *>     or removed inside it: "A  B   C" prints with 2 and 3
      *>     spaces.
