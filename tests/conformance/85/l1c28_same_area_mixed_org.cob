      *> ISO §12.4.6.4.3 SR4 / §12.4.6.4.4 GR1 — one file-area SAME
      *> clause over SEQUENTIAL, RELATIVE and INDEXED files with three
      *> different access modes, each opened in turn.
      *> SR4: "The files specified in a given SAME clause need not all
      *>   have the same organization or access."
      *>   cite.py: OK  §12.4.6.4.3 4)  (Syntax rules)
      *> GR1: "A file-area format SAME clause specifies that two or more
      *>   files referenced by file-name-1, file-name-2 are to use the
      *>   same memory area during processing. ... No more than one of
      *>   these files may be in the open mode at a given time."
      *>   cite.py: OK  §12.4.6.4.4 1)  (General rules)
      *> Derivation. SR4 makes this clause legal: FS is SEQUENTIAL
      *> ACCESS SEQUENTIAL, FR is RELATIVE ACCESS RANDOM, FI is INDEXED
      *> ACCESS DYNAMIC, so the program compiles. GR1: the three files
      *> share one area, and the program keeps at most ONE of them open
      *> at any time (each OPEN is preceded by the CLOSE of the other),
      *> so the sharing is transparent: every file keeps exactly the
      *> records written to it, which were written while a DIFFERENT
      *> member had previously used the shared area.
      *>   FS: written SEQ-A, SEQ-B; read sequentially -> SEQ-A, SEQ-B.
      *>   FR: key 2 = REL-2, key 1 = REL-1; random read 1 then 2.
      *>   FI: keys K2 then K1 written (dynamic access, random WRITE);
      *>   read NEXT after OPEN INPUT returns ascending key order:
      *>   K1 IDX-1, then K2 IDX-2.
      *> Each file's status after its last I-O is 00 (successful).
      *> A wrong implementation (a file's records clobbered by another
      *> member's use of the shared area, or SR4 violated by rejecting
      *> the mixed clause) changes these lines.
