      *> ISO 13.18.40.3 SR1 (ALL FORMATS, 85-era and unchanged in all four editions) — "The PICTURE clause may be
      *> specified only at the elementary level", read with 8.5.1.3.1 — "The most basic subdivisions of a record,
      *> that is, those not further subdivided, are called elementary items". The ONE test is the SUBORDINATE
      *> COUNT, and this program is the OVER-REJECTION guard for the screen that enforces it (kb/Work PB527):
      *> every entry below is legal source that the rule must leave alone, and each is a shape the screen could
      *> have mis-read if it had asked DataItem.IsElementary (which is defined as "has a PICTURE") instead.
      *>   G      — a group with no PICTURE, three levels deep; only the leaves carry one.
      *>   R      — a level-66 RENAMES entry: not a Format-1 entry at all (13.16.2 format 2), never PICTURE-bearing.
      *>   N-88   — a level-88 condition-name over a PICTURE-bearing conditional variable, whose PICTURE belongs
      *>            to the variable and not to the 88 (13.16.2 format 3); the 88 is a CHILD of a PICTURE-bearing
      *>            entry, so a screen keyed on "has children" alone would refuse its parent.
      *>   E      — an elementary 01 with a PICTURE and nothing subordinate: SR1's whole permitted population.
      *> Expected values are the declared widths; the point of the case is that it COMPILES.
