      *> kb/Work PB693 - THE OTHER HALF OF THE RESERVATION GATE: at an
      *> edition where ISO 8.9 does NOT reserve the word, it stays an
      *> ordinary user-defined word, declared AND referenced.
      *>
      *> The gate the fix generates is `{userWordHere("W")}?` on each
      *> cobolWord alternative, not a deletion, precisely so this
      *> program keeps compiling: 8.3.2.1 rule 1 bars a reserved word
      *> from the user-defined-word slot, and none of these nine
      *> words is reserved in X3.23-1985.  Each frees at a different
      *> boundary (reserved-words.json intervals), so the program
      *> walks the whole 8.9 timeline in one compile:
      *>
      *>   reserved from 2002 - UNLOCK, SHARING, RETRY (file sharing
      *>                        and record locking), RAISING (the EC
      *>                        family), CONSTANT (the 13.10 constant
      *>                        entry), PROGRAM-POINTER (13.18.60)
      *>   reserved from 2014 - FUNCTION-POINTER (13.18.60)
      *>   reserved from 2023 - XOR, COMMIT
      *>
      *> ORDER joined the roster at kb/Work PB704 (reserved from
      *> 2002).  It is the one word here that was NOT a lexer token
      *> until that fix: the SORT DUPLICATES phrase (14.9.40.2) and
      *> the SPECIAL-NAMES ORDER TABLE clause (12.3.7.2) spelled
      *> their own keyword as a `cobolWord`, so the 8.9 funnel -
      *> which screens IDENTIFIER occurrences POSITION-BLIND - read
      *> the format's own word as a user-defined one and rejected
      *> the phrase at 2002+.  This line is the 85 half of the
      *> nameSlot row that fix added.
      *>
      *> Both positions are exercised for each: the DECLARATION in
      *> WORKING-STORAGE and a REFERENCE in a statement operand - the
      *> reference matters because the gate withdraws the word from
      *> the operand slot at the editions that DO reserve it, and at
      *> 85 it must not.
