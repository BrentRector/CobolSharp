      *> ISO 13.18.54.3 SR1: "Each data-name-1, identifier-1 or arithmetic-expression-1 is an addend. The whole
      *> clause is referred to as a SUM clause even though the SUM keyword may appear more than once."
      *> ISO 13.18.54.3 SR5: "If the addend is identifier-1, it shall specify a numeric data item not defined in
      *> the report section."  An IDENTIFIER is 8.4.3.1.2 Format 2, qualified-data-name-with-subscripts, so a
      *> SUBSCRIPT is part of the addend's written reference - and a subscript may be an integer literal, an
      *> index-name or an arithmetic expression (8.4.2.3), none of which has a value in the data division.
      *> ISO 13.18.54.4 GR1: "Each entry containing a SUM clause establishes an independent sum counter" - ONE
      *> counter per ENTRY, however many times the SUM keyword appears.
      *> ISO 13.18.54.4 GR7 c): with no UPON phrase the addend is added "whenever any GENERATE statement is
      *> executed for the current report" (c 1); with an UPON phrase, "whenever any GENERATE statement is
      *> executed for a detail referenced by the UPON phrase" (c 2) - so the phrase belongs to ITS SUM group.
      *> ISO 13.18.54.4 GR9: "If the SUM clause specifies more than one addend, the result is the same as when
      *> all the addends were summed separately according to the above rules and the results added together."
      *> ISO 8.3.2.4.3: "uppercase words that are not underlined are called optional words and may be specified
      *> at the user's option with no effect on the semantics of the format" - and the printed general format
      *> (13.18.54.2, PDF p487) underlines SUM, UPON, RESET and FINAL and leaves OF plain, so SUM OF is legal.
      *>
      *> THE POINT OF THIS PROGRAM.  Every addend below is a SUBSCRIPTED reference into one WORKING-STORAGE
      *> table, written five ways, and one entry writes the SUM keyword TWICE with a different UPON list each
      *> time.  Before kb/Work PB482 the binder captured an addend with the FILE STATUS key helper - base word
      *> plus IN/OF qualifiers, subscript dropped on the floor - so every column here either ABORTED the process
      *> at the first GENERATE ("SUM addend not resolvable to storage") or, for the two-SUM entry, silently
      *> discarded all but the last SUM group.
      *>
      *> DERIVATION OF THE EXPECTED OUTPUT.  WS-CELL holds 11, 22, 33; IX is SET TO 2 and WS-K is 1, so all
      *> three of WS-CELL(2), WS-CELL(IX) and WS-CELL(WS-K + 1) are the SAME item, value 22.  Three GENERATE
      *> statements are executed - DET-A, DET-B, DET-A - and none of columns 1, 5 and 9 carries an UPON phrase,
      *> so GR7 c) 1) adds on each of the three: 22 * 3 = 066 in each.  Column 13 writes two SUM groups:
      *> WS-CELL(1) = 11 UPON DET-A fires on the two GENERATE DET-A statements (22) and WS-CELL(3) = 33 UPON
      *> DET-B fires on the one GENERATE DET-B (33), and GR1 puts both into the ONE counter of that entry:
      *> 22 + 33 = 055.  Column 17 has three addends in one group, GR9: (11 + 22 + 33) * 3 = 198.  No RESET
      *> phrase is written, so GR2 resets each counter at the end of the group it is printed in - the CONTROL
      *> FOOTING FINAL, produced once by TERMINATE (14.9.46.4 GR2) - and the printed values are the totals over
      *> the whole report.  The detail lines carry no digits, so the report file's digits, in file order, are
      *> exactly the footing line: 066 066 066 055 198.
      *>
      *> HOW IT IS WITNESSED AT COBOL-85.  ORGANIZATION IS LINE SEQUENTIAL is a COBOL-2023 introduction and a
      *> sum counter's own data-name is not yet referable from the procedure division, so the report file is
      *> read back one character per record - the pb523_linage_margins_on_the_medium_85 precedent - and every
      *> character that passes the 8.8.4.4 NUMERIC class test is appended to a buffer.  Expected:
      *> DIGITS=066066066055198     and NDIG=15.
