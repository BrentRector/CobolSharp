      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §8.4.2.2.3 SR1 and SR6 for INDEX-NAMES (kb/Work PB919).
      *>   SR1: "For each non unique user-defined name that is explicitly referenced, uniqueness shall be
      *>   established through a sequence of qualifiers that precludes any ambiguity of reference."
      *>   SR6: "The qualification of an index-name may include the name of the table with which the
      *>   index-name is associated, as well as any name by which that table may be qualified."
      *>   SR3: "The words IN and OF are equivalent."
      *> TA and TB each declare INDEXED BY IX, so every IX below is qualified - through its table (IX OF EA),
      *> through the table's record (IX OF TA), or with IN. Each declaration owns its OWN index (§14.9.39.4
      *> GR1 associates an index-name with the table whose INDEXED BY phrase names it), so setting one never
      *> moves the other. Before PB919 the two shared ONE cell, the qualified spellings were "not defined",
      *> and the bare IX compiled clean (the negative companion pb919-index-name-ambiguous).
      *> WHY EACH LINE CAN FAIL:
      *>   EA=      the first PERFORM stores each occurrence number into EA: 01 02 03.
      *>   EB=      the second stores W * 10 into EB: 10 20 30 40 - a shared cell would leave IX at 4
      *>            (one past TA's bound) before the loop and write nothing.
      *>   PICK=    SET IX OF EA TO 2, IX OF EB TO 4, JX TO 1 (JX is unique - no qualifier needed):
      *>            EA(2)=02, EB(4)=40, EB(1)=10. One cell would read EA(4) or EB(2).
      *>   DISTINCT the relation IX OF EA = 2 AND IX IN TB = 4 is true only with two cells.
      *>   FOUND=   SEARCH EB VARYING IX OF EB from 1 stops at EB(3)=30.
      *>   UP=      SET IX OF TA UP BY 1 moves EA's index 2 -> 3: EA(3)=03; EB's index stays 3 (FOUND).
