      *> ISO 5.2.3 — an uppercase word printed WITHOUT an underline is an OPTIONAL WORD: it may be written or
      *> omitted, and omitting it does not change the meaning. In every arithmetic statement's printed general
      *> format the word ON is NOT underlined (SIZE, ERROR and NOT are), so `SIZE ERROR` and `NOT SIZE ERROR`
      *> are legal spellings of the same phrases. Measured rather than assumed: the underline rectangles were
      *> read per word off the PDF on pages 632 (COMPUTE), 644 (DIVIDE) and 703 (MULTIPLY).
      *> Regression guard for the defect fixed 2026-07-27: arithmeticOnSizeError, computeOnSizeError and
      *> mcsExceptionPhrases all required the token ON, so every line below was rejected with COBOL0001
      *> "no viable alternative at input 'SIZE'" — while callOnExceptionPhrase next door already had `ON?`,
      *> so the grammar contradicted itself. This golden pins ON as omittable for all five arithmetic
      *> statements, and proves each phrase still binds to its own role.
