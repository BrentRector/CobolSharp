      *> ⛔ PAGE-COUNTER IS A LEGAL RECEIVING OPERAND, IN EVERY CONTEXT THAT ADMITS AN INTEGER DATA ITEM
      *> (kb/Work PB429). Before this, `MOVE 7 TO PAGE-COUNTER` drew COBOLNET0899 "PAGE-COUNTER as a
      *> receiving operand (legal) is not yet implemented" — the compiler refusing a program while conceding
      *> in its own diagnostic that the program was right.
      *>
      *> THE RULE. §8.4.3.15.3 SR1: "In the report section, PAGE-COUNTER and LINE-COUNTER may be referenced
      *> only in a SOURCE clause. In the procedure division, PAGE-COUNTER and LINE-COUNTER may be referenced
      *> in any context where an integer data item may appear." SR3 then subtracts one of them, and only one:
      *> "LINE-COUNTER shall not be referenced as a receiving operand." PAGE-COUNTER is therefore admitted as
      *> a receiving operand by the explicit construction of the two rules — and §13.18.37.4 GR6's
      *> parenthetical, "this phrase ensures that PAGE-COUNTER will be one, effective from the start of the
      *> next page (unless procedurally altered)", is the standard naming the very use. §8.4.3.15.4 GR1 makes
      *> the counters "temporary unsigned integer data items of class and category numeric", which is the
      *> receiving profile every store below goes through. The complement is
      *> conformance:negative/pb429-line-counter-receiving, which pins SR3 at every edition.
      *>
      *> SR1 NAMES NO STATEMENT, so this golden runs the COUNTER THROUGH THE CONTEXTS, not through MOVE:
      *> each line below is one context that admits an integer data item, and each expected value is the
      *> arithmetic of the statement itself. INITIATE sets PAGE-COUNTER to 1 (§14.9.21.4 GR1 c) and no page
      *> advance occurs here (one GENERATE on a 60-line page), so the counter's whole history is the program's.
      *>
      *>   MOVE 7 TO PAGE-COUNTER OF RPT1        -> 0007   (§14.9.25 — the qualified spelling, §8.4.3.15 SR2)
      *>   ADD 3 TO PAGE-COUNTER                 -> 0010
      *>   SUBTRACT 4 FROM PAGE-COUNTER          -> 0006
      *>   MULTIPLY 2 BY PAGE-COUNTER            -> 0012
      *>   DIVIDE 3 INTO PAGE-COUNTER            -> 0004   (truncation, §14.9.12.4 — 12 / 3 = 4 exactly)
      *>   COMPUTE PAGE-COUNTER = PAGE-COUNTER + 40 -> 0044  (it is a SENDING operand in the same statement)
      *>   ADD 1 2 GIVING PAGE-COUNTER           -> 0003   (a GIVING resultant)
      *>   INITIALIZE PAGE-COUNTER               -> 0000   (§14.9.20.4 GR6 c: the receiving operand is of
      *>                                                   category Numeric, so the sending operand is the
