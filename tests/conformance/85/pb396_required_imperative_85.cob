      *> kb/Work PB396 - THE POSITIVE CONTROL for the required imperative-statement operand, at the edition
      *> that INTRODUCED every one of these formats (COBOL-85). The rule is edition-independent, so this is the

      *> WHY IT EXISTS: `statementBlock*` in the control-flow grammar restored the zero case that ISO
      *> 5.2.6.2/5.2.6.3 forbid, and every one of the phrase positions below used to accept an EMPTY body in
      *> silence. Tightening the quantifier is only half a fix — this program is the other half: each position
      *> written WITH its imperative must still compile and must still produce the value the general rules give
      *> it, or the tightening would have been "satisfied" by refusing the construct.
