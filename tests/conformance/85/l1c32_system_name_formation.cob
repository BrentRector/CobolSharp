      *> environment. The implementor may define rules for the formation of a system-name
      *> that add restrictions to the rules for formation of a COBOL word." A computer-name
      *> is one of the listed system-names.

      *> THE DOCUMENTED CHOICE. docs/CONFORMANCE.md#DOC-A.1-198: "Provided - one
      *> restriction": a system-name shall not consist of digits only (then it is an
      *> integer literal; see the companion negative l1c32-system-name-all-digits), and
      *> "Unlike a user-defined word, a system-name need not contain a letter otherwise:
      *> `123ABC`, `MY_BOX-9` and `1-2` are all accepted as computer-names."
      *>
      *> This program pins the PERMISSIVE half: `1-2` (no letter at all) and `123ABC`
      *> (leading digits) are legal computer-names. An implementation applying the
      *> user-defined-word letter rule to system-names rejects `1-2`.
      *> DERIVATION: the program compiles and runs; its one line is
