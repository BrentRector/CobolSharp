      *> kb/Work PB235 - ISO 14.9.6.4 GR7, the availability of the record
      *> area after a CLOSE, over a SAME RECORD AREA group. Every value
      *> below is DERIVED from the rule, not observed:
      *>
      *> GR7: "If file-name-1 is specified in a SAME RECORD AREA clause,
      *> the record area is available to the runtime element if any of the
      *> file connectors referenced by the other file-names in that SAME
      *> RECORD AREA clause are open." 12.4.6.4.4 GR2 says the same thing
      *> from the clause's side and adds which record it holds: "A logical
      *> record in the shared memory area is a logical record of each file
      *> open in the output mode and of the most recently-read file open
      *> in the input mode."
      *>
      *> GR7 governs "the CLOSE statement WITHOUT the UNIT phrase" only,
      *> so the CLOSE ... UNIT below cannot change availability at all
      *> (Table 14's Non-unit x CLOSE UNIT cell is symbol e: "The file
      *> remains in the open mode ... and no other action takes place").
      *>
      *> The LAST line is COBOL.NET's documented DETERMINATION, not the
      *> standard's answer: once no member of the group is open the area
      *> is UNAVAILABLE (GR7) and the standard defines nothing about
      *> referencing it, so docs/CONFORMANCE.md 7 (A.1 item 24) states
      *> that the storage keeps its last content. It is pinned here so
      *> determination cannot drift silently.
