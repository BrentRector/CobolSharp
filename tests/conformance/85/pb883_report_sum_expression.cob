      *> ⛔ arithmetic-expression-1 IS A SUM ADDEND FORM, AND THE SUM CLAUSE HAS A ROUNDED PHRASE (kb/Work PB883).
      *> ISO 13.18.54.2's general format (PDF p487 rendered) writes
      *>     { SUM OF { data-name-1 | identifier-1 | arithmetic-expression-1 } … [ UPON { data-name-2 } … ] } …
      *>     [ RESET ON { data-name-3 | FINAL } ] [ rounded-phrase ]
      *> and 13.18.54.3 SR1 confirms it: "Each data-name-1, identifier-1 or arithmetic-expression-1 is an addend."
      *> The grammar had `sumOperand : dataReference (OF reportName)?` — no expression form at all — so `SUM WS-K + 1`
      *> died as a raw parse error at every edition.  SR6 governs what such an expression may contain: "If the
      *> addend is arithmetic-expression-1, any identifiers it contains may reference entries in any section of the
      *> data division other than the report section."  13.18.54.4 GR3 gives it its accumulation: "The adding is
      *> consistent with the general rules of the ADD statement with the ON SIZE ERROR phrase or, in the case of an
      *> arithmetic expression, the COMPUTE statement with the ON SIZE ERROR phrase."
      *>
      *> ⚠ DETERMINATION — WHAT THE SUM CLAUSE'S ROUNDED PHRASE ROUNDS.  13.18.54.4 GR4 says "the content of the
      *> sum counter is computed according to the general rules for the COMPUTE statement with the ROUNDED
      *> phrase".  COBOL.NET reads that as governing the ACCUMULATION of each addend into the counter (GR3's
      *> implicit ADD/COMPUTE).  The rejected reading is that it governs GR4's subsequent MOVE of the counter to
      *> the printable item: GR1 derives the counter's digits, integral AND fractional, from that item's own
      *> PICTURE, so that transfer is always scale-identical and the phrase could never change any result — a
      *> reading that makes a normative phrase dead.  13.18.54.3 SR3 ("The ROUNDED phrase may be specified in the
      *> SUM clause only if the COLUMN clause is specified for the subject of the entry") is honoured either way.
