      *> kb/Work PB207 - the COBOL-85 EDITION LEG of the 13.18.63.4 GR5 group-VALUE area rule.
      *> GR5 - "If a VALUE clause is specified in a data description entry of a group item, the group area is
      *> initialized without consideration for the individual elementary or group items contained within this
      *> group" - is edition-invariant, but its two 2002+ pins cannot witness it at 85: pb184_group_value_area
      *> writes TYPEDEF / TYPE and pb207_bit_group_value writes GROUP-USAGE, both COBOL-2002 introductions.
      *> This file is the 85 witness, in constructs COBOL-85 already had.
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, COMPUTED FROM THE SPEC BEFORE THE CONFIRMING RUN.  GA is an alphanumeric group item
      *> (13.18.29.4 GR3), so GR7 sends the literal through 14.6.8.5 - "aligned at the leftmost character
      *> position in the data item with space fill or truncation to the right":
      *>   GA  area "ABCD" (exactly 4)     -> P1=AB  P2=CD
      *>   GB  figurative ZEROS            -> 8.3.3.6.4 GR2 repeats the one character to the area width and
      *>                                      GR4 gives it as the character '0' -> "0000", Q1=00 Q2=00
      *>   GC  area "AB" into 4 positions  -> "AB  " (14.6.8.5 SPACE fill), R1=AB R2=two spaces
      *> Every subordinate is usage DISPLAY, which is what 13.18.63.3 SR14 requires of an alphanumeric group
      *> item carrying a VALUE; the complement is pinned by negative/pb184-group-value-non-display.
