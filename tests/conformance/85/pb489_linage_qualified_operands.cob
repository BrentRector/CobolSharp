      *> ISO §13.18.34.2 — the LINAGE clause's general format prints
      *> data-name-1 … data-name-4, and a data-name in a general format
      *> is a QUALIFIED-DATA-NAME (§8.4.2.2.2 Format 1):
      *>   python scripts/spec/cite.py --check 8.4.2.2.3 "A name may be
      *>   qualified even though it does not need qualification"
      *>   -> OK  §8.4.2.2.3 2)  (Syntax rules)
      *>   python scripts/spec/cite.py --check 8.4.2.2.3 "For each non
      *>   unique user-defined name that is explicitly referenced,
      *>   uniqueness shall be established through a sequence of
      *>   qualifiers that precludes any ambiguity of reference."
      *>   -> OK  §8.4.2.2.3 1)  (Syntax rules)
      *> so `LINAGE IS PG-SZ OF R-GRP LINES` is legal — and, in THIS
      *> program, where W-GRP and R-GRP each declare PG-SZ, FT-AT, TP-MG
      *> and BT-MG, the qualified form is the ONLY legal way to name any
      *> of the eight items.
      *>
      *> WHAT THE VALUE IS. §13.18.34.4 GR6:
      *>   python scripts/spec/cite.py --check 13.18.34.4 "If a literal
      *>   is specified, the value is always that literal."
      *>   -> OK  §13.18.34.4 6) a)
      *>   python scripts/spec/cite.py --check 13.18.34.4 "If a data-name
      *>   is specified, the value is the content of the data item
      *>   referenced by the associated data-name"
      *>   -> OK  §13.18.34.4 6) b)
      *> GR6 a) and GR6 b) are two routes to ONE number, so a clause
      *> written with four literals and a clause written with four
      *> qualified data-names HOLDING THOSE LITERALS describe the SAME
      *> logical page. That equivalence is the whole assertion here, and
      *> it is why the fixture writes two files and compares them rather
      *> than restating a page-geometry derivation: PRTL carries
      *> `LINAGE 2 FOOTING 2 TOP 3 BOTTOM 2` as literals, PRTQ carries the
      *> same four values as `… OF R-GRP`, and every observable of the
      *> two files must agree, value for value.
      *>
      *> ⛔ THE DISTINGUISHER IS DECLARATION ORDER. W-GRP is declared
      *> FIRST and holds 5 / 4 / 1 / 4 — different in every operand. A
      *> compiler that keeps only the base word of the operand and then
      *> resolves it by first match binds W-GRP's items, and this fixture
      *> was written because that is exactly what COBOL.NET did: the
      *> IN/OF qualifier was accepted by the grammar and discarded by the
      *> binder, so the whole page model was built on another data item's
      *> value with no diagnostic at any stage (kb/Work PB489, measured).
      *> Under that defect PRTQ has page size 5, footing 4, top margin 1
      *> and bottom margin 4, so BOTH observables below diverge: the
      *> end-of-page branches change (a 5-line body is not reached by
      *> three single-line advances) and so do the byte offsets.
      *>
      *> OBSERVABLE 1 — THE END-OF-PAGE BRANCH PER WRITE, which is what
      *> makes the FOOTING operand visible at all (§13.18.34.4 GR1: the
      *> footing start is the one phrase that is NOT part of the logical
      *> page size, so it can only be seen through the end-of-page
      *> condition). §13.18.34.4 GR7 d) sets LINAGE-COUNTER to one at
      *> OPEN OUTPUT and GR7 c) 2 adds each advance, so on a 2-line body
      *> with the footing start at 2 every one of the three writes leaves
      *> the counter in the footing area or past the page size — the
      *> §14.9.51.4 GR26 b) and GR26 a) arms respectively, both of which
      *> raise the end-of-page condition. All six branches are therefore
      *> EOP, on both files.
      *>
      *> OBSERVABLE 2 — THE BYTES ON THE MEDIUM, which is what makes the
      *> TOP and BOTTOM operands visible (a margin has no effect on the
      *> counter). The derivation of the three offsets for exactly this
      *> geometry is the one already recorded in
      *> tests/conformance/85/pb523_linage_margins_on_the_medium_85.cob —
      *> LINAGE 2 / TOP 3 / BOTTOM 2, three WRITEs AFTER ADVANCING 1 LINE,
      *> every travelled line a 2-character newline and every record 4
      *> characters: lines 1-4 blank (offsets 1-8), AAAA at 9, lines 5-10
      *> blank (13-24), BBBB at 25, line 11 blank (29-30), CCCC at 31.
      *> The FOOTING phrase does not move them: GR1 — "The logical page
      *> size is the sum of the values referenced by each phrase except
      *> the FOOTING phrase."
      *>   python scripts/spec/cite.py --check 13.18.34.4 "The logical
      *>   page size is the sum of the values referenced by each phrase
      *>   except the FOOTING phrase."   -> OK  §13.18.34.4 1)
      *>
      *> EDITION. The LINAGE clause, its four operands and §8.4.2.2's
      *> qualification rules are present in all four supported editions,
      *> so there is ONE copy of this fixture and it sits at the earliest
      *> of them; the behaviour does not differ by edition. The reader is
      *> a plain record-sequential FD over a one-character record, not
      *> ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL, because that phrase is COBOL-2023
      *> (§12.4.5.10.3 GR2) and would not compile here.
      *>
      *> THE OPTIONAL WORDS, IN THE SAME COMPARISON. §13.18.34.2's figure
      *> underlines LINAGE, FOOTING, TOP and BOTTOM and NOTHING else, so
      *> IS, LINES, WITH, AT and the two `LINES AT` are optional words:
      *>   python scripts/spec/cite.py --check 8.3.2.4.3 "uppercase words
      *>   that are not underlined are called optional words and may be
      *>   specified at the user's option with no effect on the semantics
      *>   of the format"   -> OK  §8.3.2.4.3 (Optional words)
      *> PRTL therefore
      *> writes the MINIMUM spelling — `LINAGE 2 FOOTING 2 TOP 3 BOTTOM 2`
      *> — while PRTQ writes every optional word, so the two files also
      *> assert that the two spellings are the SAME clause. A grammar that
      *> required any of those words would not compile this fixture at all.
      *>
      *> ⛔ WHY EACH WRITE IS PRECEDED BY ITS OWN MOVE — §14.9.51.4 GR4
      *> makes the released record no longer available in the record area
      *> unless the file is named in a SAME RECORD AREA clause, and
      *> neither file is.
