      *> kb/Work PB202. ISO 1989:2023 13.18.38.4 GR8 decides how much of an occurs-depending group an operation
      *> uses, and the two arms AGREE on the sending side: GR8a (data-name-1 outside the group) and GR8b (data-name-1
      *> "included in the same group and the group data item is referenced as a sending operand") both use "only
      *> that part of the table area that is specified by the value of the data item referenced by data-name-1".
      *> Only a RECEIVING operand splits: GR8b "If the group is a receiving operand, the maximum length of the group
      *> will be used." 8.4.3.3.4 GR5 makes a reference-modified group "a subset of the data item referenced by
      *> identifier-1", so G(4:) READ is the group as a sending operand, and GR5c with length omitted runs to "the
      *> rightmost position of the data item referenced by identifier-1" - the CURRENT extent 1 + 2 x 3 = 7.
      *>   R1 = 2cccddd  G(1:7), depending INSIDE, count 2.
      *>   R2 = cddd     G(4:) stops at the current extent (the unused area holds eee fff ggg).
      *>   R3 = cddd     H(3:), the depending-OUTSIDE control (GR8a): extent 2 x 3 = 6.
      *>   R4 = 2cccddd  the whole-group MOVE, which always took the current extent.
      *> RECEIVING: MOVE "XYZXYZXYZ" TO G(2:9) at count 2 - GR8b gives the receiver the MAXIMUM length 16, so
      *> positions 2-10 take the value and positions 11-16 (fff ggg) are outside the unique data item and
      *> unmodified; raising the count to 5 shows the whole group:
      *>   R5 = 5XYZXYZXYZfffggg
      *> Before the fix R2 read cdddeee (the maximum image, into the unused table area).
