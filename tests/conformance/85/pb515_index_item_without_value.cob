      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 13.16.3 SR10 (kb/Work PB515) forbids a VALUE clause on a data item of class index;
      *> an index data item takes its value from SET (14.9.39.4 GR1). This is the legal spelling beside the
      *> negative pb515-value-on-index-item, written (77 I) and inherited (13.18.60.4 GR1: 01 G USAGE INDEX makes
      *> A and B two index data items).
      *> WHY EACH LINE CAN FAIL:
      *>   I=       I saved X at 3, so T(X) after SET X TO I is C.
      *>   AB=      A saved X at 1 and B at 5 - two distinct items: A E. One shared cell would print E E.
