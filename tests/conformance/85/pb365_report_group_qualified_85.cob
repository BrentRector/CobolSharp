      *> THE OLDEST EDITION'S ARM of the same rule its 2023 twin (2023/pb365_report_group_qualified) proves.
      *> §8.4.2.2 qualification and §14.9.16.3 SR1's "It may be qualified by a report-name" are edition-invariant
      *> — neither the uniqueness rule nor the report-group qualifier has an introduction edition — so the
      *> qualified spelling shall parse and bind identically at --std 85, and the declarative shall attach to the
      *> report its qualifier names.  There is NO gating diagnostic to check: nothing here is edition-gated.
      *>
      *> DERIVATION OF THE EXPECTED OUTPUT is the 2023 twin's, unchanged: the declarative names DET-A OF R-B, so
      *> only R-B's presentation runs it (§14.9.49.4 GR8/GR9 c)-d)).  Expected: GEN-A, GEN-B, HOOK, N=1.
