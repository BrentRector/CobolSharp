      *> F-IX writes its clauses in the REVERSE of the printed order
      *> (FILE STATUS, RECORD KEY, ACCESS MODE, ORGANIZATION, ASSIGN).
      *> F-SQ puts ASSIGN last after ORGANIZATION and FILE STATUS.
      *> F-RD names the same physical file as F-SQ with the clauses in
      *> printed order, so it reads what F-SQ wrote only if the
      *> trailing ASSIGN clause of F-SQ took effect.
      *> Every clause must take effect wherever it is written:
      *>   IX-OPEN=00   OPEN OUTPUT of the indexed file: success 00.
      *>   IX-W2=00     WRITE key K2: success.
      *>   IX-W1=00     WRITE key K1: success.
      *>   IX-DUP=22    WRITE of K1 again: RECORD KEY is honoured, so a
      *>                duplicate prime key is an invalid key (22), and
      *>                FILE STATUS (written first) receives it.
      *>   IX-R=K1ONE   random READ by key K1 (ACCESS DYNAMIC) finds
      *>                the record written with that key.
      *>   IX-NX=K2TWO  READ NEXT continues in key order (INDEXED).
      *>   IX-MISS=23   random READ of key K9: no record, status 23.
      *>   SQ=00        OPEN OUTPUT / WRITE / CLOSE of F-SQ: 00.
      *>   RD=HELLO     F-RD (same ASSIGN literal) reads F-SQ's record.
