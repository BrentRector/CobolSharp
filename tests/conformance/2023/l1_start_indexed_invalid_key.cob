      *> ISO §14.9.41.4 GR17 e) 2. (INDEXED FILES) — "If the comparison
      *> is not satisfied by any record in the file, the invalid key
      *> condition exists and the execution of the START statement is
      *> unsuccessful." (The identical sentence is GR9 c) for RELATIVE
      *> files; this program exercises the INDEXED arm.)
      *> Two shapes of "not satisfied by any record", plus a control.
      *>   S1  CONTROL — the comparison IS satisfiable, so the START
      *>       succeeds, the NOT INVALID KEY imperative runs (§9.1.14),
      *>       the status is '00', and the following READ NEXT delivers
      *>       the record the START positioned at (§14.9.30.4 GR21 d1).
      *>       Without this line the two invalid-key legs could pass by
      *>       a START that always fails.
      *>   S2  A relation no record can satisfy: KEY > "ZZZ999" over
      *>       AAA100 / BBB200 / CCC300. The INVALID KEY imperative is
      *>       taken. The value: §9.1.13.5 lists the whole invalid-key
      *>       family — '21' is an indexed WRITE/REWRITE sequence
      *>       error, '22' a duplicate key created by a WRITE or
      *>       REWRITE, '24' a WRITE outside the file's boundaries —
      *>       and none of the three can arise from a START, so '23' is
      *>       the only applicable value and §9.1.13.1's "if more than
      *>       one value applies" tie-break is never reached. The
      *>       standard states '23' outright for every START
      *>       invalid-key leg it spells out (GR14, GR18, GR19, GR20,
      *>       GR21).
      *>   S2R "the execution of the START statement is unsuccessful"
      *>       has a consequence in GR7 — "the file position indicator
      *>       is set to indicate that no valid record position has
      *>       been established" — so the next sequential READ is '46'
      *>       (§9.1.13.7 item 6a, "The preceding START statement …
      *>       was unsuccessful"), NOT the at end '10'.
      *>   S3  The other shape: an EMPTY indexed file, where no record
      *>       exists to satisfy any comparison. Same condition, '23'.
