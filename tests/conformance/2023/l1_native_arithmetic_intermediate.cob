      *> ISO 8.8.1.3 Native arithmetic - the TECHNIQUES and the
      *> INTERMEDIATE DATA ITEM (Annex A.1 item 123; docs/CONFORMANCE.md
      *> row 123).
      *> 8.8.1.3: "Native arithmetic is an implementor-defined method of
      *> evaluating an arithmetic expression, an arithmetic statement,
      *> the SUM clause, and all integer and numeric functions. Native
      *> arithmetic is in effect when the ARITHMETIC IS NATIVE clause is
      *> specified in the OPTIONS paragraph or no ARITHMETIC clause is
      *> specified. The implementor shall specify techniques used for
      *> native arithmetic."  14.7.7 rule 4a names what is being
      *> specified: "If any form of standard arithmetic is in effect, a
      *> standard intermediate data item of the form appropriate to that
      *> mode of arithmetic is used. Otherwise, an implementor-defined
      *> intermediate data item is used."  COBOL.NET's is a scaled
      *> Int128 - a 128-bit two's-complement unscaled value with a
      *> compile-time decimal scale.
      *>
      *> WHY THESE VALUES MEASURE THAT AND NOT SOMETHING WEAKER. 14.7.7
      *> rule 2a fixes the domain the standard REQUIRES native
      *> arithmetic to handle for ADD, DIVIDE, MULTIPLY and SUBTRACT
      *> when no operand is an intrinsic function, a binary- or float-
      *> usage item, or a floating-point literal: "the composite of
      *> operands shall not contain more than 31 digits", the composite
      *> being "a hypothetical data item resulting from the
      *> superimposition of specified operands in a statement aligned on
      *> their decimal points". Every statement below sits exactly ON
      *> that 31-digit boundary with none of the excluded operand kinds,
      *> so an implementation whose intermediate cannot hold the
      *> boundary is non-conforming rather than merely different - and
      *> the values below are the arithmetic identities, not a rendering
      *> of the carrier.
      *> MUL31 (10**16 - 1) * (10**15 - 1) = 10**31 - 11*10**15 + 1, a
      *>       31-digit exact product; composite 16/15/31 = 31 digits. A
      *>       64-bit intermediate wraps; a 28-digit decimal one
      *>       overflows (its ceiling is about 7.9E+28); binary64 loses
      *>       every digit past the 17th. Only an exact carrier of at
      *>       least 104 bits answers 9999999999999989000000000000001.
      *> MULSC the SCALE half: 999999999999.999999 * 999999.9999,
      *>       composite 18 integer plus 10 fraction = 28 digits,
      *>       product exact at 999999999899999999.0000000001. An
      *>       intermediate that carried the value as a float, or that
      *>       rescaled before multiplying, cannot end in ...0000000001.
      *> ADD31 the aligned-sum half at the same boundary: (10**31 - 2) +
      *>       1, composite 31 digits.
      *> The ARITHMETIC clause is written explicitly so the file names
      *> the mode it measures; 11.9.5.2 GR4 ("If the ARITHMETIC clause
      *> is not specified in this source element or a containing source
      *> element, it is as if the ARITHMETIC clause were specified with
      *> the NATIVE phrase") makes the no-clause default the same mode,
      *> and that arm is what the rest of the corpus compiles under.
