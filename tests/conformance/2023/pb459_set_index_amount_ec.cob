      *> kb/Work PB459 - the CHECKING-ON twin of pb459_set_index_amount_guards: the two conditions the SET

      *>
      *> ISO 14.9.39.4 GR2 a) 1. a / GR3 name EC-BOUND-SUBSCRIPT for a non-integer amount; GR2 a) 1. b and
      *> GR4 a) name EC-RANGE-INDEX for a value or result "outside the limit specified in General rule 2 of
      *> 13.18.38, OCCURS clause". ISO 13.18.38.4 GR2 makes that limit the implementor's index range and names
      *> the three statements it governs: "An index may be modified only by a PERFORM VARYING statement, a
      *> SEARCH statement, and a SET statement." Both conditions are Fatal in Table 13, so the declarative runs
      *> and RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT (14.9.33) keeps the run unit alive past it.
      *>
      *> Before PB459 EC-RANGE-INDEX had NO raise site anywhere in the compiler - the catalog carried its
      *> Table 13 row and a >>FLAG-02 flagger asked whether it was enabled, so it read as wired while it could
      *> never occur - and the two EC-BOUND-SUBSCRIPT arms could not fire either, because the emitter narrowed
      *> the amount with a (long) cast before anything could test it.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE SPEC AND NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>
      *> SUB=        SET IX TO 2 succeeds; SET IX UP BY 1.5 violates GR3, so EC-BOUND-SUBSCRIPT is set to exist
      *>             and the declarative reports it. FUNCTION EXCEPTION-STATUS (15.32.3) returns the name in a
      *>             31-character alphanumeric field, so it is space-padded to 31.
      *> AFTER-SUB   GR3's other two consequents still hold after the declarative resumes: the SET was
      *>             unsuccessful and IX is unchanged => +0000000000000000002.
      *> RANGE=      SET IX TO 1 then UP BY 9223372036854775800 leaves IX at 9223372036854775801 (inside the
      *>             range). UP BY 100 would make it 9223372036854775901, outside it, so GR4 a) sets
      *>             EC-RANGE-INDEX and the declarative reports it.
      *> AFTER-RANGE GR4 a)'s other two consequents: unsuccessful, receiving operand unchanged =>
      *>             +9223372036854775801.
