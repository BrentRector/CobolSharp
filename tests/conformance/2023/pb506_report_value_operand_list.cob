      *> ⛔ A REPORT-SECTION VALUE CLAUSE IS AN OPERAND LIST, AND A VALUE IS AN INITIALIZATION — NOT A MOVE
      *> (kb/Work PB506).  Two rules, one lane, and both of them used to be wrong.
      *>
      *> (1) THE OPERAND LIST.  ISO §13.18.63.2 format 4 is `{ VALUE IS | VALUES ARE } { literal-1 } …`, so the
      *> clause takes one or MORE literals, and §13.18.63.4 GR23 distributes them: "If the VALUE clause has more
      *> than one operand, successive operands are assigned to successive repeating printable items, horizontally
      *> and then vertically, as applicable, in that hierarchy.  If no further operands remain, assignment begins
      *> again from the first operand."  §13.18.63.3 SR35 confines the multi-operand form to a repeating entry
      *> and fixes the count: "The number of operands of the VALUE clause shall be equal to the number of
      *> repetitions of the repeating entry or the same number multiplied by the number of repetitions of any
      *> number of successive repeating entries at higher levels than the repeating entry."  §13.15.4 GR3 says
      *> what a repeating entry is: "An entry that contains either an OCCURS clause or a LINE or COLUMN clause
      *> with more than one operand is said to be a repeating entry, and the number of repetitions is defined to
      *> be integer-2 of the OCCURS clause or the number of operands of the LINE or COLUMN clause, whichever is
      *> applicable."  The SOURCE clause carries the SAME two rules verbatim — §13.18.53.3 SR6 and §13.18.53.4
      *> GR4 — so both clauses ride one operand list and one cycling reader.
      *>
      *> (2) THE VALUE IS NOT A MOVE.  §13.18.63.4 GR21 imports GR7 into format 4: "Each literal is aligned in
      *> the associated data item in accordance with 14.6.8, Alignment and transfer of data into data items,
      *> except that initialization is not affected by a JUSTIFIED clause and no editing takes place", and GR8
      *> ("When a numeric-edited data description includes the BLANK WHEN ZERO clause and the VALUE clause uses
      *> either an alphanumeric or national literal, the BLANK WHEN ZERO clause has no effect on initialization").
      *> §13.18.63.3 SR34 imports SR11, whose second sentence is "Editing characters in a picture character-string
      *> for an alphanumeric-edited or national-edited data item do not cause editing of the initial value when
      *> the data item is initialized."  The report emitter used to push a VALUE operand through the SOURCE
      *> clause's implicit MOVE (§13.18.53.4 GR1), which applies exactly the three transforms those rules
      *> exclude.  EVERY printable item below has its IDENTICAL twin in WORKING-STORAGE, and the program prints
      *> both: the two lanes are one rule and shall answer alike.
      *>
      *> DERIVATION OF THE EXPECTED OUTPUT.  One TYPE DE group, one LINE, six printable entries; §13.18.14.4
      *> GR1/GR2 place each field's leftmost character at its COLUMN.
      *>   cols  1/ 6/11  PIC X(3) VALUE "AAA" "BBB" "CCC"  — GR23 sentence 1: AAA, BBB, CCC in that order.
      *>   cols 16/21     PIC X(3) SOURCES ARE WS-P WS-Q    — §13.18.53.4 GR4, the same rule for SOURCE: PPP, QQQ.
      *>   col  26        PIC XXBXX VALUE "AB CD"           — SR34→SR11 / GR21→GR7: stored as written, `AB CD`
      *>                                                      (the MOVE would edit it to `AB  C`).
      *>   col  34        PIC X(5) JUSTIFIED VALUE "AB"     — GR7: JUSTIFIED does not affect initialization, so
      *>                                                      `AB   ` (the MOVE would right-justify to `   AB`).
      *>   col  40        PIC ZZZ9 BLANK WHEN ZERO
      *>                           VALUE "0000"             — GR8: an alphanumeric literal, BWZ has no effect, so
      *>                                                      `0000` (the MOVE would blank it).
      *>   col  46        PIC ZZ9  VALUE 12                 — SR11 sentence 1 / SR6: a numeric literal into a
      *>                                                      numeric-edited item IS edited, so ` 12`.
      *> The check paragraph reads the report file back and displays the windows, then displays the five
      *> working-storage twins, which §13.18.63.4 GR7/GR8 and §13.18.63.3 SR11 give the same values.
