      *> A VARIABLE-LENGTH GROUP'S LENGTH IS 15.50.4 RULE 7's SUM, AND IT IS A RUNTIME VALUE.
      *> r7: the value returned is the sum of (a) the lengths of all subordinate non-variable-length data items,
      *> (b) the CURRENT lengths of all subordinate dynamic-length elementary items, and (c) subordinate
      *> dynamic-capacity tables at their current capacity.
      *>
      *> THIS GOLDEN EXISTS BECAUSE THE ANSWER WAS SILENTLY WRONG (fix-queue PB24). BindLengthFold had arms for
      *> ref-mod, OCCURS DEPENDING, ANY LENGTH, national dynamic-length and dynamic-length ELEMENTARY items - and
      *> NO arm for a GROUP with a dynamic descendant. Such a group fell through to the fixed fold, and
      *> DataItem.ImageWidth contributes ZERO for a dynamic-length child (8.5.1.10 - its width is a runtime fact).
      *> MEASURED before the fix: X(4) plus a DYNAMIC LENGTH child holding "XYZ" returned 4, not 7. No diagnostic.
      *> A missing arm in a dispatch - this compiler's most reproducible defect shape, in its silent form.
      *>
      *> THE CASES BELOW ARE THE ONES A SHALLOW FIX PASSES AND A CORRECT ONE MUST TOO: a fixed group must still
      *> fold unchanged; TWO dynamic children must both count; a dynamic leaf NESTED in a subordinate group must
      *> count (r7 says "all subordinate", not "all immediate children"); and the value must TRACK THE CONTENT at
      *> run time - regrowing the child must change the answer, which is what proves this is not a new constant.
