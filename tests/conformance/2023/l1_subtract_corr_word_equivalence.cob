      *> ISO §14.9.44.3 SR5 (FORMAT 3) — "The words CORR and
      *> CORRESPONDING are equivalent."
      *> ⛔ THE RULE IS ABOUT THE TWO SPELLINGS, SO THE GOLDEN WRITES
      *> BOTH.  A fixture that spells only one of them cannot
      *> distinguish "CORR and CORRESPONDING are equivalent" from
      *> "only the word I happened to write is implemented", which is
      *> the entire content of SR5; the two statements below are
      *> IDENTICAL apart from the word, and run over two receiving
      *> groups seeded identically, so any difference in the printed
      *> lines is a difference the standard forbids.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED FROM THE RULE TEXT.  §14.7.6 pairs
      *> P with P and Q with Q — same data-name, same qualifiers up to
      *> but not including the two group operands, both members
      *> numeric (its rule 3), no OCCURS / REDEFINES / RENAMES.
      *> §14.9.44.4 GR3: "data items in identifier-4 are subtracted
      *> from and stored in corresponding items in identifier-5".
      *> §14.9.44.4 GR5: "The results are the same as if the user had
      *> referred to each pair of corresponding identifiers in
      *> separate SUBTRACT statements."  Hence P: 10 - 03 = 07 and
      *> Q: 20 - 07 = 13, into PIC 9(2) receivers (§14.6.8.2 rule 4,
      *> aligned with zero fill) -> 07 and 13 for EACH spelling.
      *> The values are chosen so the two members differ from one
      *> another, so a fixture that matched only the first pair, or
      *> that crossed the pairs, would not print 0713.
      *> The receivers are copied to unqualified items before DISPLAY
      *> only to keep the printed line free of qualification syntax;
      *> a PIC 9(2) to PIC 9(2) move is an identity transfer under
      *> §14.6.8.2 rule 4 and adds nothing to the derivation.
