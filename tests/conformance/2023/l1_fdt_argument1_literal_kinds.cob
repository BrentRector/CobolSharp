      *> ISO §15.40.3 r1 - "Argument-1 shall be a national or alphanumeric
      *> literal." BOTH admitted spellings, and the OBSERVABLE that tells
      *> them apart: §15.40.1's type table makes the FUNCTION's type follow
      *> argument-1's ("Alphanumeric | Alphanumeric", "National | National"),
      *> so an alphanumeric format literal yields a result a PIC X item may
      *> receive and a national one yields a national result.
      *>
      *> ⚠ ONLY ONE OF THE TWO MOVES BELOW DISCRIMINATES, and §14.9.25.3
      *> rule 10's Table 16 says which. Its Alphanumeric row gives National
      *> "Yes", so the NAT- lines would compile even if the result were
      *> mis-typed alphanumeric; its National row gives Alphanumeric "No", so
      *> the AN- lines are the ones a mis-typing breaks. The missing half -
      *> that the NATIONAL literal really does make the function national -
      *> is the negative l1-fdt-national-result-to-alphanumeric, which is
      *> what makes r1's national leg OBSERVABLE rather than merely
      *> accepted. This file's own job is the accept side of both spellings:
      *> both are admitted and both compute the same value.
      *>
      *> The other half of r1 - LITERAL-ness - is the negative corpus:
      *> l1-fdt-argument1-not-a-literal (COBOLNET1517, a PIC X data item) and
      *> l1-fdt-argument1-boolean-literal (COBOLNET1627, a literal that is
      *> neither national nor alphanumeric).
      *>
      *> Derivation of the values (§15.5.2 integer date 1 = 1601-01-01, so
      *> 143951 = 1995-02-15; §15.5.5 45296 seconds past midnight = 12:34:56;
      *> §15.3.3.7 combined = date, T, time, basic with basic and extended
      *> with extended; §15.3.3.1 an extended common time format carries its
