      *> ISO 11.3 / 12.3.6: a CLASS-ID's ENVIRONMENT DIVISION — its OBJECT-COMPUTER paragraph's PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE
      *> and CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION clauses — applies to the class's METHODS, each of which is a runtime element
      *> (14.6.6 r2 "On activation of a runtime element"; 12.3.6.4 GR8 / GR11). kb/Work PB111: both clauses used to be a
      *> Roslyn CS0103 on the emitted class (the program class alone declared __COLLATE / __CLASSIFY); the ONE
      *> ObjectComputerEmit helper now serves the program, instance and factory classes, and a method resolves its
      *> classification at ITS activation (an activation local — a method is re-entered on the same object).
      *>
      *> What each line proves:
      *>   CLS-UP  — a factory method of a class with CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION IS TR: UPPER-CASE("i") → U+0130 (ORD 305),
      *>             the Turkish LC_CTYPE (15.97.4 r3), witnessed by FUNCTION ORD.
      *>   CLS-REL — an object method of a class with PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE IS REV ("Z" THRU "A"): "A" < "B" is FALSE
      *>             under REV (12.3.6.4 GR11 — the class's sequence governs the method's comparisons) → "GT".
      *>   PRG-REL — the invoking PROGRAM has no collating sequence: the same relation is TRUE natively → "LT".
      *> Every DISPLAY is ASCII.
