      *> kb/Work PB646 - the BYTE IMAGE of national-form numeric data (ISO 1989:2023 13.18.60.4 GR8).
      *>
      *> GR8: "National characters shall be represented in the storage of the computer as characters of
      *> a uniform size equal to or a multiple of the size of characters in the computer's alphanumeric
      *> character set. Each implementor shall specify the size and representation of characters stored
      *> for usage NATIONAL." COBOL.NET pins TWO bytes per national character position, UTF-16 big-endian
      *> (data-model design D-N1); this golden is where that determination is OBSERVED rather than
      *> asserted, through the byte surfaces 13.18.44 REDEFINES and 14.9.3 the record area.
      *>
      *> 13.18.40.4 GR1 makes each symbol of a usage-national PICTURE a NATIONAL character position, so
      *>   NB1 PIC 9(3) USAGE NATIONAL is 3 positions = 6 bytes
      *>   NB2 PIC 9(2) USAGE NATIONAL is 2 positions = 4 bytes
      *> and the group is 10 bytes, which FUNCTION BYTE-LENGTH (15.14.4) reports and over which
      *> 13.18.44.4 GR1 lays the redefining PIC X(10).
      *>
      *> The redefining item's ten alphanumeric positions hold, in order, the UTF-16BE serialization of
      *> "123" and "45": 00 31 00 32 00 33 00 34 00 35. Reading it back through an ordinary alphanumeric
      *> REDEFINES would print those NUL bytes, so the golden measures the ODD positions instead - the
      *> low byte of each pair - which are exactly the digit characters. The EVEN positions are each the
      *> high byte 00, and the golden asserts that too: it is the half of the determination a
      *> single-byte reading would not distinguish.
      *>
      *> WRITING THROUGH THE OTHER DESCRIPTION IS THE SAME AREA (13.18.44.4 GR1 - "the storage area ...
      *> begins at the first bit of the data item referenced by data-name-2 and continues over an area
      *> sufficient to contain the number of bits required"): storing the ten characters of the
      *> serialization of 987 / 65 through RB makes NB1 read 987 and NB2 read 65.
      *>
      *> THE INSERTION CHARACTERS OF A NATIONAL-FORM NUMERIC-EDITED ITEM (13.18.40.4 GR2): "The value of
      *> insertion and replacement characters in a resultant edited item is the value of those characters
      *> in the computer's runtime coded character set. When the usage of the item being edited is
      *> national, the value is the national character representation; otherwise, the value is the
      *> alphanumeric character representation." NEDIT PIC ZZ9.99 USAGE NATIONAL is SIX national
      *> character positions (GR1 + GR14's Z / 9 / '.'), so 12 bytes, and after MOVE 42.5 its image is
      *> " 42.50" - where the '.' is an INSERTION position (GR14: "the character '.' represents the
      *> decimal point for alignment purposes and ... represents a character position into which the
      *> character '.' is inserted"). The golden reads the 6 LOW bytes back as the image and counts the
      *> 6 HIGH bytes as zero, which is what "the national character representation" of a period is under
      *> the D-N4 total UTF-16 identity: U+002E, serialized 00 2E - not one byte, and not a national
      *> character that differs from its alphanumeric correspondent.
