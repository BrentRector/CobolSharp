      *> kb/Work PB334 — READ ... PREVIOUS on a file with SEQUENTIAL organization, the 2023 leg.
      *> Until PB334 this arm of the binder never called readDirection(): PREVIOUS bound as a forward
      *> read at every edition and the COBOLNET0900 gate never fired.

      *> THE RULES, and every expected value below derived from them (no observation):
      *>  14.9.30.4 GR19 - "An implicit or explicit NEXT phrase or a PREVIOUS phrase results in a
      *>    sequential read", so every READ here is Format 1 (12.4.5.5.2 SR2 bars ACCESS RANDOM/DYNAMIC
      *>    on a sequential file, and 14.9.30.3 SR8 then implies NEXT when no direction is written).
      *>  14.9.30.4 GR21 "When the file is a sequential file":
      *>    b) file position indicator established by a prior OPEN -> "the first existing record that is
      *>       selected is made available, regardless of whether NEXT or PREVIOUS is specified"  (R1, R9)
      *>    c) established by a prior successful READ -> the first existing record whose number is
      *>       "greater than the file position indicator if NEXT ... or is less than the file position
      *>       indicator if PREVIOUS"                                        (R2-R7)
      *>    e) no such record -> the at end condition                        (R8)
      *>    f) the indicator becomes the number of the record made available (R4 proves it: the forward
      *>       read after a backward one resumes from the REPOSITIONED indicator, not from record 3)
      *>  14.9.30.4 GR24 a)/c) - the at end condition sets '10' and transfers control to the AT END
      *>    imperative                                                       (R8)
      *>  14.9.35.4 GR5 - "the operating environment logically replaces the record that was accessed by
      *>    the READ statement", so the REWRITE after a backward READ replaces RECORD 1        (RW)
      *>
      *> EDITIONS: Annex E is INFORMATIVE and its only READ-positioning change, E.2 item 22, amends the
      *> INDEXED after-OPEN rule (GR21 d.3); the SEQUENTIAL block prints rule b) unamended in 2023, so
      *> this behaviour is identical at 2002, 2014 and 2023 -- which is what the three copies of this
      *> program assert. At --std 85 the whole program is rejected: negative/pb334-read-previous-85.
