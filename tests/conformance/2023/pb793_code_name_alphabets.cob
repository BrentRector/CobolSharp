      *> ISO 12.3.7.3 SR15 - "The implementor shall specify the names supported for code-name-1 and
      *> code-name-2 in the ALPHABET clause, if any." Owner decision kb/Work PB793: the code-name-1 set is
      *> ASCII and EBCDIC (the code-name-2 set stays empty). 12.3.7.4 Table 6 gives code-name-1 a Y in BOTH
      *> columns, and 12.3.7.4 GR7 i states what the implementor then owes - "the ordinal number of each
      *> character for use when code-name-1 references a coded character set and the collating position of
      *> each character for use when code-name-1 references a collating sequence ... the correspondence
      *> between characters of the alphanumeric coded character set specified by code-name-1 and the
      *> characters of the native alphanumeric coded character set". This program pins BOTH columns.
      *>
      *> THE DETERMINATIONS (CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-183 / DOC-A.1-184 carry them in full):
      *>   ASCII  = ISO/IEC 646 IRV, 128 characters, ordinal n = native character n-1, native order.
      *>            The same set and sequence 12.3.7.4 GR7 c gives STANDARD-1.
      *>   EBCDIC = IBM CCSID 37, 256 characters; ordinal n is the native character code unit n-1 of that
      *>            page spells; the collating position of a native character IS its CCSID 37 code unit;
      *>            every native character the page does not spell follows, in native relative order.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, ALL DERIVED FROM THOSE TWO DETERMINATIONS AND NOTHING ELSE:
      *>   SYMBOLIC Z-EBC IS 241 IN A-EBC - GR11 b: "the value of figurative constant symbolic-character-1
      *>     is the representation of the coded character at ordinal position integer-1 ... in the character
      *>     set referenced by alphabet-name-3". Ordinal 241 = CCSID 37 code unit 240 = X'F0' = DIGIT ZERO,
      *>     whose native correspondence is "0".
      *>   SYMBOLIC Z-ASC IS 66 IN A-ASC - ordinal 66 = native character U+0041 = "A".
      *>   FUNCTION ORD - 15.70.4 r1: "the ordinal position of argument-1 in the current alphanumeric
      *>     program collating sequence" (1-based). Under A-EBC, "A" is at CCSID 37 code unit X'C1' = 193,
      *>     so ORD("A") = 194; "0" is at X'F0' = 240, so ORD("0") = 241; "a" is at X'81' = 129, so 130.
      *>   FUNCTION CHAR - 15.15.4 r1: "the character in the alphanumeric program collating sequence having
      *>     the ordinal position specified by argument-1". CHAR(241) = position 240 = "0".
      *>   The relations - 8.8.4.2.7 compares "with respect to the collating sequence of characters
      *>     specified for the current alphanumeric program collating sequence". EBCDIC puts the lowercase
      *>     letters BELOW the uppercase and both BELOW the digits, which is the reverse of the native
      *>     (ASCII-coincident) order on the second pair: "a" < "A" is TRUE and "A" < "0" is TRUE, where
      *>     natively "a" < "A" is FALSE and "A" < "0" is FALSE. A compiler that ignored the code-name and
      *>     left the sequence native would answer N to both.
      *>   The SORT - 14.9.40.4 GR5 a: the statement's COLLATING SEQUENCE phrase applies to keys of class
      *>     alphabetic and alphanumeric. The released keys are "0", "A" and "a": native order 0 A a,
      *>     EBCDIC order a A 0. THIS PROGRAM DECLARES NO PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE for the SORT leg to
      *>     inherit from - it is a separate source unit - so leg S1 (no phrase, GR5 b, native) and leg S2
      *>     (the phrase) differ only in the phrase, and each is evidence about the other.
