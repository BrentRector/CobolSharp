      *> kb/Work PB921 - the OVER-REJECTION GUARD for the one ISO 13.18.63.3 SR6 edition screen, at the edition
      *> that introduced the rule. SR6 - "If the item is of category numeric-edited, then, subject to Syntax rules
      *> 2 and 3, literals in formats 1, 2, and 4 of the VALUE clause may be numeric when they shall be converted
      *> to their numeric-edited forms according to the rules for the MOVE statement" - is dated by Annex E.3.3
      *> item 43 ("It is now permitted to allow numeric-edited data items to be assigned values specified as
      *> numeric literals"), a COBOL-2023 addition. The screen that enforces that edition used to be written at
      *> ONE call site and so reached only formats 1 and 2; it is now asked once, from the funnel every format's
      *> literal passes through. This program is what proves the wider reach did not become a wider REJECTION:
      *> every arm below is legal at COBOL-2023 and shall compile and produce its computed value. The gating
      *> negatives are tests/conformance/negative/pb921-condition-name-numeric-edited-below-2023 (format 3) and
      *> pb921-report-numeric-edited-below-2023 (format 4).
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, COMPUTED FROM THE RULES - never measured:
      *>   A  format 3 over PIC ZZ9.99. 14.9.39.4 GR6 places the literal "according to the rules for the VALUE
      *>      clause", i.e. SR6's MOVE-rules conversion. 13.18.40.5 editing rule 7 a) puts the replacement
      *>      character (a space, for 'Z') in "any character position immediately preceding ... the first nonzero
      *>      numeric character in the item": the integer positions ZZ9 hold 010, so Z->space, Z->'1', 9->'0',
      *>      and the fraction is 00. A = [ 10.00]. 8.8.4.5.3 then makes A-TEN true right after the SET.
      *>   B  format 3 with the ALPHANUMERIC edited image instead - SR7's spelling, legal at EVERY edition and
      *>      untouched by the edition screen (the screen asks about a NUMERIC literal only). B = [ 10.00].
      *>   C  format 3 with the literal ZERO. SR6 exempts "the figurative constant ZERO or ZEROES and the integer
      *>      and decimal forms of the literal zero" at all editions, so this is NOT gated. PIC ZZ9 holding 0
      *>      suppresses both leading zeros and prints the 9 position: C = [  0].
      *>   D  format 4 (report-section) over PIC ZZ9.99, the same conversion into a printable item, read back
      *>      through a LINE SEQUENTIAL view of the report file: D = [ 10.00].
