      *> kb/Work PB753 - a READ delivers the record the PHYSICAL
      *> FILE holds NOW, never an image a sibling connector has already
      *> REWRITTEN and that this connector merely has in a buffer.
      *>
      *> THE RULES.
      *> 14.9.35.4 GR4: "The successful execution of the REWRITE
      *> statement releases a logical record to the operating
      *> environment." So a '00' from the sibling's REWRITE is a promise
      *> that the record IS in the physical file.
      *> 14.9.51.4 GR12 says the same of WRITE, which is why the APPEND
      *> leg below is a control and not a second defect.
      *> 9.1.15 3): "The sharing with all other mode allows concurrent
      *> access to a physical file through other file connectors
      *> specifying input, I-O, or extend mode" - the shape is legal,
      *> explicitly, and 14.9.27.4 Table 19 makes ALL OTHER/I-O against
      *> ALL OTHER/INPUT a Normal open.
      *> 14.9.30.4 GR21 c): the record selected by a sequential READ is
      *> "the first existing record IN THE PHYSICAL FILE whose relative
      *> key number is greater than the file position indicator if NEXT
      *> is specified or implied", and d): "If a record is found
      *> according to the above rules, the record is made available in
      *> the record area associated with file-name-1". THE PHYSICAL
      *> FILE, at the READ - not a snapshot of what it said earlier.
      *>
      *> WHY 300 RECORDS. The reader's read-ahead is 1024 characters;
      *> 300 four-byte records is 1200 bytes, so the file cannot sit
      *> inside one buffer and the staleness is a property of the
      *> mechanism rather than of the file size. Record 3 is inside the
      *> buffer the reader filled taking record 1, which is what makes
      *> the measurement about the buffer.
      *>
      *> EVERY EXPECTED VALUE. Each leg seeds 300 "OLD" records through
      *> an exclusive connector, opens a reader INPUT and takes record 1
      *> (=OLD), opens a sibling I-O connector, reads to record 3,
      *> REWRITEs it to NEW (GR4 releases it) and closes; the reader
      *> then takes records 2 and 3. Record 2 was not rewritten, so it
      *> is OLD; record 3 WAS, so GR21 c)/d) require NEW. Every status
      *> is '00' - 9.1.13.2 item 1, successful completion - and no
      *> status anywhere reports staleness, which is why a wrong answer
      *> here is silent.
      *>
      *> THE CLAUSE-LESS LEG (N-) carries no SHARING and no LOCK MODE
      *> clause anywhere. kb/Work PB740 made Table 19 admit such a pair
      *> on one physical file, so a program that never mentions sharing
      *> reaches the same rule; 9.1.15's implementor default is
      *> UNDETERMINED for this compiler (kb/Work PB322) and the
      *> arbitration reports a conflict only where every candidate mode
      *> would - which INPUT beside I-O is not.
      *>
      *> AND THE N- LEG DELIBERATELY DOES NOT USE THE REPORTED
      *> SEQUENCE. Widening or narrowing the 9.1.15 union over a
      *> physical file makes this compiler REBUILD the other
      *> connectors' handles at their logical offset, which throws a
      *> read-ahead away as a side effect. For a SHARING WITH ALL
      *> OTHER pair the union never moves, so the F-/V-/L- legs
      *> measure the rule; for a clause-less pair it widens at the
      *> sibling's OPEN and narrows again at its CLOSE, so a reader
      *> that filled its buffer before the OPEN and read after the
      *> CLOSE is rescued twice by that accident - MEASURED, with
      *> the coherence rule injected out this leg still printed NEW
      *> while F-/V-/L- printed OLD. So N- re-fills its read-ahead
      *> AFTER the sibling's OPEN (N-R2) and reads on while the
      *> sibling is STILL OPEN (N-R3, N-R4), leaving no reposture
      *> between the fill and the read. The sibling REWRITEs ordinal
      *> 4 here, so N-R3 is OLD and N-R4 is NEW.
      *>
      *> THE APPEND CONTROL (A-) is the leg that was already correct and
      *> shall stay correct: a reader can only have buffered what
      *> existed, so a record a sibling adds after the reader has
      *> consumed the file is delivered (14.9.51.4 GR12 released it).
      *>
      *> THE KEYED CONTROLS (R-, X-) were already correct for the reason
      *> that names the fix: RELATIVE and INDEXED connectors over one
      *> host path share ONE record store (kb/Work PB143), so a
      *> sibling's REWRITE is visible the instant it happens. 14.9.35.4
      *> GR4 is the same rule for them; only the medium differs.
