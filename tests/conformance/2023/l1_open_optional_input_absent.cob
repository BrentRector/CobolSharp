      *> ISO §14.9.27.4 GR13 — "If the file is not present, and the
      *> INPUT phrase is specified in the OPEN statement, and the
      *> OPTIONAL clause is specified in the file control entry for
      *> file-name-1, the file position indicator in the file connector
      *> referenced by file-name-1 is set to indicate that an optional
      *> input file is not present."
      *> The rule sets a STATE, so it is observed through the three
      *> statements the standard defines over that state, on all three
      *> organizations (the rule names none, so it holds for each):
      *>   OPEN itself — §9.1.13.2 item 4a: "For an OPEN statement, it
      *>     is successfully executed but the file is described as
      *>     optional and the physical file is not present" ⇒ '05'.
      *>   a sequential READ — §14.9.30.4 GR21: "If the file position
      *>     indicator indicates that an optional input file is not
      *>     present … the I-O status value … is set to '10', the at
      *>     end condition exists"; also §9.1.13.4 item 1c.
      *>   a START — §14.9.41.4 GR5: "If, at the time of the execution
      *>     of the START statement, the file position indicator
      *>     indicates that an optional input file is not present, the
      *>     invalid key condition exists and the execution of the
      *>     START statement is unsuccessful", and §9.1.13.5 item 3b
      *>     names the value: "a START or random READ statement is
      *>     attempted on a file described as optional and the physical
      *>     file is not present" ⇒ '23'.
      *> GR13 vs GR17: the INPUT phrase does NOT create the file — GR17
      *> gives creation to EXTEND and I-O only. Q-AGAIN re-opens the
      *> same file-name and gets '05' a second time; had the first OPEN
      *> created it, §9.1.13.2 item 4a could not apply and the value
      *> would be '00'.
      *> Each observation starts from a fresh OPEN, because §14.9.41.4
      *> GR7 and §14.9.30.4 GR24b overwrite the file position indicator
      *> once a START or READ has failed.
