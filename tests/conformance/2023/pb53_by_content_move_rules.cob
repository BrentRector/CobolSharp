      *> ISO 14.8.2.3.3 rule 2d: a BY CONTENT argument whose formal is not
      *> numeric, not an index item and not ANY LENGTH conforms by "the same
      *> [rules] as for a MOVE statement with the argument as the sending operand
      *> and the corresponding formal parameter as the receiving operand".
      *>
      *> SO THE RULE IS AN AGREEMENT, AND THIS GOLDEN ASSERTS IT AS ONE. Every
      *> pair below performs the SAME transfer twice - once across an INVOKE
      *> BY CONTENT and once as a plain MOVE - and prints both. A pair that
      *> disagrees is a violation of rule 2d whatever either value is, which is a
      *> stronger and more durable assertion than pinning the values themselves.
      *>
      *> Before fix-queue PB53 the INVOKE half of pairs 1-3 did not compile at
      *> all: OoContentMismatch fell back to 14.8.2.3.2 - the BY REFERENCE
      *> IDENTITY rule - for boolean, national and numeric-edited formals, and
      *> reported "category mismatch" citing a clause that does not govern the
      *> crossing. 14.9.25.3 Table 16 admits all three:
      *>     boolean -> national        Yes
      *>     alphanumeric -> boolean    Yes
      *>     national -> boolean        Yes
      *>
      *> Pairs 4-5 are the WIDTH-DIFFERING crossings that strict identity had
      *> made unreachable, so the emitter never needed a store discipline for
      *> them. It does now: 14.6.8.6 truncates on the right into a boolean
      *> receiver, and the crossing reaches MoveEmitter.ConvertSource - the one
      *> place that discipline is written - rather than re-deriving it.
