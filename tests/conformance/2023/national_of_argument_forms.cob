      *> ISO §15.66 NATIONAL-OF — both shapes of the general format (§15.66.2):
      *>     FUNCTION NATIONAL-OF ( argument-1 [ argument-2 ] )
      *> §15.66.3 r2: argument-2 is a one-character national substitution character; it substitutes only
      *> for characters with no national correspondent, and every character of "XY" has one, so both
      *> forms return N"XY" — the presence of argument-2 is exactly what this golden pins.
      *> §15.66.4 r1: each alphanumeric character converts to its corresponding national representation;
      *> §15.66.4 r4: the length is the national character positions required — 2, proven by LENGTH.
