      *> §8.4.3.12.4 GR4 — "If the runtime system cannot locate the function, the EC-FUNCTION-NOT-FOUND
      *>   exception condition is set to exist and the value of the address-identifier is the predefined
      *>   address NULL."  The VALUE is defined, so the store still happens.
      *> §14.9.39.4 GR14 — "If the address identified by identifier-13 is neither the predefined address NULL
      *>   nor the address of a function defined with the same signature …, the EC-FUNCTION-PTR-INVALID
      *>   exception condition is set to exist, NO DATA ITEMS ARE CHANGED, and the execution of the SET

      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, derived line by line:
      *>   A-SET      WS-NAME holds "PBRTDBL", the function IS locatable, so FPD holds its address (GR1a/GR2).
      *>   NF-RAISED  WS-NAME holds "NOSUCHFN": GR4 sets EC-FUNCTION-NOT-FOUND, whose declarative runs …
      *>   B-NULL     … and the address-identifier's value is the predefined address NULL, which IS stored.
      *>   PI-RAISED  FPD is re-set to PBRTDBL (1 formal), then to PBRTZERO (0 formals). FPD is restricted to
      *>              PBRTDBL, so GR14's signature test fails and EC-FUNCTION-PTR-INVALID's declarative runs …
      *>   C-KEPT     … and NO DATA ITEM IS CHANGED: FPD still holds PBRTDBL's address, so it equals FPREF.
      *>              (Neither NULL — which would be the GR4 outcome — nor PBRTZERO's address.)
