      *> ISO §13.18.60.4 GR6 — USAGE COMPUTATIONAL: the implementor's radix
      *> and format, the alignment and representation including the algebraic
      *> sign, and the range of values the item may hold (Annex A.1 item 208;
      *> docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-208).
      *>
      *> THE RULE. §13.18.60.4 GR6: "The USAGE COMPUTATIONAL clause specifies
      *> that a radix and format specified by the implementor is used to
      *> represent a numeric item in the storage of the computer. Each
      *> implementor specifies the precise effect of the USAGE COMPUTATIONAL
      *> clause upon the alignment and representation of the data item in the
      *> storage of the computer, including the representation of any
      *> algebraic sign, and upon the range of values that the data item may
      *> hold."
      *> THREE determinations, one leg group each: FORMAT+ALIGNMENT (W),
      *> REPRESENTATION INCLUDING THE SIGN (BE, IDENT), RANGE (HOLD, SIZE,
      *> KEEP).
      *>
      *> THE DETERMINATION, docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-208: COMPUTATIONAL
      *> (and its COMP synonym) is "identical to USAGE BINARY — radix 2, the
      *> item 205 width ladder and byte order, the same PICTURE-digit-count
      *> truncation discipline". DOC-A.1-205 supplies what that inherits: a
      *> two's-complement integer of the item's UNSCALED value, MOST
      *> SIGNIFICANT BYTE FIRST, 2 bytes for 3-4 digits, no alignment padding.
      *> This golden's job is to MEASURE that identity rather than restate it,
      *> because "identical to BINARY" is precisely the kind of claim that can
      *> rot into two code paths that agree on the common cases.
      *> §13.18.60.3 SR6 supplies the second spelling: "COMP is an
      *> abbreviation for COMPUTATIONAL." The vendor synonym COMP-4 is
      *> deliberately NOT written here — it is not an ISO word, and a
      *> strict-conformance golden should not depend on one.
      *>
      *> W — width and alignment. All three spellings of the same picture
      *>     answer 2 (DOC-A.1-205: 3-4 digits -> 2 bytes). FUNCTION
      *>     BYTE-LENGTH is §15.14.1, "an integer equal to the length of the
      *>     argument in bytes".
      *> BE — representation INCLUDING THE SIGN, on the COMPUTATIONAL item.
      *>     -1234 in 16 bits two's complement is 65 536 - 1234 = 64 302 =
      *>     X"FB2E", most significant byte first, so the group image holds
      *>     X"FB" then X"2E". FUNCTION ORD is 1-based (§15.70.1, "The lowest
      *>     ordinal position is 1") and the native alphanumeric ordinal of a
      *>     character is its code unit + 1, so the two bytes read 251+1 = 252
      *>     and 46+1 = 47. A little-endian implementation answers "47 252"; a
      *>     sign-magnitude or packed representation answers neither. The
      *>     bytes are reached through a GROUP move to an alphanumeric item,
      *>     which §14.9.25.4 GR4 makes a byte transfer ("treated exactly as
      *>     if it were an alphanumeric to alphanumeric elementary move"),
      *>     never a numeric conversion.
      *> IDENT — the identity claim itself, and the leg no earlier golden
      *>     carries: the same picture and the same value at COMPUTATIONAL, at
      *>     COMP and at BINARY produce the SAME four bytes, neighbours
      *>     included. conformance:2023/l1_usage_binary_storage pins the
      *>     BINARY side alone; this is the side that says COMPUTATIONAL did
      *>     not drift away from it.
      *> HOLD / SIZE / KEEP — the RANGE determination, which is the one that
      *>     distinguishes DOC-A.1-208's COMP from its COMP-5 neighbour.
      *>     COMP's range is the PICTURE's digit count, so PIC S9(4) holds
      *>     9 999 (HOLD) and 10 000 is out of range: §14.7.5 case 3 makes the
      *>     size error condition exist "if, after radix point alignment and
      *>     any applicable rounding specifications, the result of an
      *>     arithmetic statement is further from zero than permitted for the
      *>     associated resultant data item", so the ON SIZE ERROR phrase is
      *>     taken (SIZE). An implementation that gave COMPUTATIONAL its
      *>     CONTAINER's range — the documented COMP-5 discipline, a different
      *>     usage — would store 10 000 in those same two bytes and answer
      *>     SIZE=NO. KEEP is §14.7.5's own consequence for the taken phrase:
      *>     "the content of that resultant identifier is not changed from the
      *>     content that existed at the start of the execution of the
      *>     arithmetic statement", so RNG still holds the 9 999 put there
      *>     before the COMPUTE.
