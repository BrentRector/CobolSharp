      *> ── LPA: the page size rule, violated at a WRITE ────────────────
      *> LPA is `LINAGE IS WS-SZ LINES`, WS-SZ = 2, no FOOTING phrase.
      *> A-OPEN  GR6 b) 1 reads 2 at the completion of the OPEN OUTPUT;
      *>         the values conform, GR7 d) sets the counter to one, so
      *>         FS=00 LC=001.
      *> A-W1    a plain WRITE adds one (GR7 c) 3): LC=002, still inside
      *>         the 2-line page body, FS=00.
      *> A-W2    WS-SZ has been moved to 0. The counter would pass the
      *>         page body, so this is a page overflow WRITE and GR6 b) 3
      *>         re-reads the operands during it — reading 0, which
      *>         violates value rule 1. The declarative for LPA fires
      *>         (USE-A), reading FS=90 and LC=000 MID-STATEMENT, and on
      *>         its return execution continues with the DISPLAY
      *>         FOLLOWING the WRITE. That DISPLAY is A-W2 and it reads
      *>         the same 90 / 000.

      *>         specifies neither ADVANCING PAGE nor a page overflow, so

      *> A-CLOSE the CLOSE is a successful operation of its own (FS=00),
      *>         and "until the file is closed" ends here.
      *> A-REOPEN with WS-SZ = 3 the next OPEN OUTPUT re-determines the
      *>         values (GR6 b) 1) and the file works again: FS=00,

      *> completion printing NO-EOP).
      *> B-OPEN  the violation is detected at the completion of the OPEN
      *>         OUTPUT (GR6 b) 1), so USE-B fires there: FS=90, LC=000.
