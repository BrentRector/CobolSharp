      *> PB10 - a FUNCTION-IDENTIFIER in the identifier-N SENDING positions that rejected it outright.
      *> 8.4.3.1.2 Format 1 makes a function-identifier an IDENTIFIER, and 8.4.3.2.3 SR1 bars one ONLY from a
      *> RECEIVING operand - so every SENDING position admits one. The grammar reached functionCall from just
      *> four rules, so these were COBOL0001 "no viable alternative" on legal source.
      *>
      *> Each position below is one the STANDARD ITSELF defines as a MOVE sending item, which is why they are
      *> fixed together and why the operand admits exactly what a MOVE sender admits:
      *>   14.9.51.4 GR5a - WRITE   ... FROM identifier-1  ==  MOVE identifier-1 TO record-name-1
      *>   14.9.35.4      - REWRITE ... FROM identifier-1  ==  the same MOVE
      *>   14.9.32.4      - RELEASE ... FROM identifier-1  ==  the same MOVE
      *>   14.9.20.3 SR4  - INITIALIZE ... REPLACING ... BY identifier-2, "the SENDING item" of a MOVE
      *>
      *> All four bind through the ONE WriteSource / operand helper rather than four call sites, so the next
      *> FROM phrase inherits the arm instead of re-deriving it.
      *>
      *> ⛔ INSPECT IS THE ONE POSITION THE GRAMMAR CANNOT DECIDE ALONE, and it is now covered - identifier-1
      *> is a SENDING operand only in Format 1 (TALLYING). Derived rather than assumed: 14.9.22.4 GR1 concedes
      *> only that "for purposes of determining its length, identifier-1 is treated as a sending data item" - a
      *> SCOPED concession that would be unnecessary if it were generally sending; GR7 has each match "tallied
      *> (format 1) or replaced by literal-3 (format 2)"; and GR20 makes Format 4 execute AS a Format 2 over the
      *> same identifier-1. So Formats 2/3/4 MODIFY it and 8.4.3.2.3 SR1 bars a function-identifier there.
      *> The grammar admits and the BINDER screens per format (COBOLNET1632); the three rejections are pinned by
      *> pb10-inspect-fn-replacing / -converting / -tallying-replacing.
      *> ⚠ THE THIRD OF THOSE IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS: a screen keyed on "TALLYING present => Format 1" would
      *> wrongly ACCEPT Format 3. The screen keys on REPLACING-or-CONVERTING present, which is also exactly the
      *> emitter's existing `mutated` flag - one fact, not two representations of it.
