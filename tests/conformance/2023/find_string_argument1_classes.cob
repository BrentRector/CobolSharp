      *> ISO §15.37.3 rule 1 — "Argument-1 shall be a data item or literal of class alphabetic,
      *> alphanumeric, or national." The rule names THREE CLASSES and TWO SPECIES (data item, literal),
      *> and §8.5.2.1 realises each class through more than one kind of item, so this pins the rule's
      *> whole admitted set rather than the one PIC X item every earlier case happens to use.
      *>
      *> §8.5.2.1: "an alphanumeric group item has class and category alphanumeric", and its Table 2
      *> puts categories Alphanumeric, Alphanumeric-edited and "Numeric-edited (if usage is display)"
      *> in class Alphanumeric, and National / National-edited in class National.
      *> §8.4.3.3.4 r6: "The unique data item has the same class, category, and usage as that defined
      *> for identifier-1" — so a reference-modified alphanumeric item is still class alphanumeric.
      *>
      *> NUMED is Table 2's third class-alphanumeric species, category numeric-edited with usage display —
      *> the one that LOOKS numeric, which is exactly the species a class screen gets wrong. It is written
      *> with a numeric-edited argument-2 because that is a pairing §15.37.3 r2 admits ("If argument-1 is of
      *> class alphabetic or alphanumeric, argument-2 shall be a data item or literal of either class
      *> alphabetic or alphanumeric" — Table 2 makes BOTH items class alphanumeric). The OTHER pairing r2
      *> equally admits — the same argument-1 beside an alphanumeric LITERAL — is legal source this compiler
      *> REJECTS (COBOLNET1627). That is a defect of r2's CROSS screen, not of r1's own screen: it belongs to
      *> inventory row AR-15.37.3-2, which today records verdict CONFORMS / state OK, and the repro that
      *> falsifies that reading is repro/find-string-numeric-edited-arg1.cob. r1's admitted set — three
      *> classes × the data-item and literal species, every Table 2 category among them — is complete here.
      *>
      *> Every value below is §15.37.4 r1's first occurrence (r1 + LAST for NATLAST) over the operand
