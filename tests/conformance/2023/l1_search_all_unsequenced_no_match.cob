      *> ISO §14.9.37.4 GR6 b) — "If no such setting of the search index
      *> exists, the final setting of the search index is undefined, the
      *> EC-RANGE-SEARCH-NO-MATCH exception condition is set to exist,
      *> and execution proceeds as in General rule 1b."
      *> GR6 applies only "If any condition specified in General rule 5
      *> is not satisfied", so this program VIOLATES GR5 a) on purpose:
      *> the OCCURS clause declares ASCENDING KEY IS WS-K and the
      *> program stores 09, 07, 05, 03, 01 — descending. That is the
      *> premise a SEARCH ALL over correctly-ordered keys cannot reach,
      *> and it is what separates GR6 from GR9.
      *> GR6 a) is deliberately NOT the branch under test: it offers the
      *> implementation two observably different outcomes and says "It
      *> is undefined which of these alternatives occurs", so no
      *> deterministic expectation exists for it. GR6 b) has exactly one
      *> outcome, and it is reached here because no occurrence holds 04.
      *> Expected: AT END is taken (GR1b1) and the last exception status
      *> names the condition GR6b sets. The final setting of the search
      *> index is undefined and is therefore never displayed.
