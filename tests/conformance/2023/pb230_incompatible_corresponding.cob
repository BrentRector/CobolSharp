      *> PB230 - ISO 14.7.6 last paragraph: "For any statement with the CORRESPONDING phrase, if any of the
      *> implied statements would set the EC-DATA-INCOMPATIBLE exception condition to exist, the
      *> EC-DATA-INCOMPATIBLE exception condition is set to exist after all of the implied statements are
      *> completed."  The condition is AGGREGATED, not raised where it arises - which matters because
      *> EC-DATA-INCOMPATIBLE is fatal (Table 13), so raising it at the first offending pair would abandon every
      *> pair to its right, and 14.7.6 says the implied statements complete first.  It is the same discipline the
      *> clause's SIZE ERROR paragraph gets ("the imperative-statement in the SIZE ERROR phrase is executed after
      *> all of the implied statements are completed").
      *> G1's leaves are numeric-DISPLAY leaves under a group REDEFINED as PIC X(9), so planting "0Q1002003"
      *> makes A of G1 hold "0Q1" - not digits, so 8.8.4.4.4 GR3 n)1.a's numeric class condition is false for it -
      *> while B ("002") and C ("003") are valid.  ADD CORRESPONDING must therefore still add ALL THREE pairs and
      *> raise once at the end: the offending pair's result is undefined (14.6.13.2 rule 2), and this compiler's
      *> documented deterministic decode contributes no digit for a non-digit position, so A2 = 0 + 01 = 00001.
      *> The MOVE CORRESPONDING leg pins the same sentence for a non-arithmetic CORRESPONDING statement ("for ANY
      *> statement with the CORRESPONDING phrase"): every pair moves, then the one condition is set.
