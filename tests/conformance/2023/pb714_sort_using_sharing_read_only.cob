      *> kb/Work PB714 — the SHARING phrase of SORT's implicit USING OPEN.
      *>
      *> ISO 14.9.40.4 GR12 a): "The processing of the file is initiated.
      *> If the file-control entry for the file has a SHARING clause with
      *> the ALL phrase, the initiation is performed as if an OPEN statement
      *> with the INPUT phrase and the SHARING WITH READ ONLY phrase had
      *> been executed; otherwise, the initiation is performed as if an OPEN
      *> statement with the INPUT phrase and without a SHARING phrase is
      *> executed.  The absence of the SHARING phrase means that the sharing
      *> mode is completely determined by the SHARING clause, if any, in the
      *> file control entry for the file connector referenced by file-name-2."
      *> 14.9.24.4 GR7 a) is the same rule for MERGE — see
      *> pb714_merge_using_sharing_read_only.
      *>
      *> The override is only observable against a connector already
      *> associated with the same physical file, so each leg holds a second
      *> SELECT open across the SORT.  9.1.13.1 makes the refusal readable:
      *> "The value of the I-O status is set during the execution of a
      *> CLOSE, DELETE, OPEN, READ, REWRITE, START, UNLOCK or WRITE
      *> statement and prior to the execution of ... any applicable
      *> exception processing statements", and 12.4.5.8.4 GR1 updates the
      *> FILE STATUS item with it — so the USE procedure GR12 a) invokes
      *> ("If a nonfatal exception condition exists as a result of the
      *> execution of the implicit OPEN statement ... the SORT statement
      *> continues as if the exception condition did not exist") sees the
      *> status THIS open produced.  Each leg's I-ST is seeded "ZZ" first,
      *> so a status that was never stored would be visible as such.
