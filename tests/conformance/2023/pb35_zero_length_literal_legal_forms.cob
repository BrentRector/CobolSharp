      *> A screen for "zero-length" written on the operand's WIDTH rather than on
      *> its being a LITERAL would reject most of what follows, and every one of
      *> these is conforming source. PB1 is the standing proof that this is the
      *> expensive direction to get wrong: an argument screen enforced from an
      *> unverified table turned away 12 legal corpus programs.
      *>
      *> Each clause says "zero-length LITERAL" in those words, so the test is on
      *> the literal, never on a computed or item width.
