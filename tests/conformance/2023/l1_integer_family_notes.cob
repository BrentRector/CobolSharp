      *> ISO §15.44.4 r1 / §15.49.4 r1 / §15.42.4 r1 — INTEGER (the floor), INTEGER-PART (the split at zero)
      *> and FRACTION-PART (the remainder of THAT split) read off ONE argument ladder, so the three rules are
      *> forced to disagree line-by-line on exactly the arguments where the standard says they must.
      *>
      *> ⛔ `ARITHMETIC IS STANDARD-DECIMAL` IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT DECORATION. §15.49.4 r1 and §15.42.4 r1
      *> define their functions by an EQUIVALENT ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION, and §15.4.1 says that under NATIVE
      *> arithmetic "the value returned is an implementor-defined approximation of the value of that
      *> expression" — which is nothing a conformance golden is entitled to assert. Under a standard mode
      *> §15.4.1 rule 1 is "the returned value shall equal the value of the equivalent arithmetic expression",
      *> so every P-* and F-* line below is NORMATIVE rather than merely expected. §15.44.4 r1 states
      *> INTEGER's value DIRECTLY (that function has no equivalent arithmetic expression), so its I-* lines
      *> are normative in every mode — pinned again under native arithmetic by conformance:85/l1_integer_floor_85.

      *> ARGUMENT is in play and only the three rules decide):

      *> ⚠ THE LAST TWO ARGUMENTS REACH THE |a| < 1 REGION, AND THEY ARE WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. A FRACTION-PART
      *> written as (a - INTEGER(a)) — the FLOOR split instead of §15.42.4 r1's INTEGER-PART split — agrees
      *> with every line here on every POSITIVE argument and returns +0.5 / +0.75 where the rule requires
      *> -0.5 / -0.25. Likewise an INTEGER-PART written as a floor returns -1 where r1 requires 0.
      *> A fixture built from the §15.42.4 NOTE's ±1.5 pair ALONE already separates the two bodies at -1.5:
      *> §15.44.4 r1 makes INTEGER(-1.5) = -2 — this file asserts exactly that on its own I-M15 line — so the
      *> floor split returns -1.5 - (-2) = +0.5 where r1 requires -0.5, and a floor-bodied INTEGER-PART returns
      *> -2 where r1 requires -1 — the two INTEGER-PART bodies differ at -1.5 too. What the ±1.5 pair
      *> cannot reach is |a| < 1: the region where the INTEGER-PART subtrahend is ZERO and the argument passes
      *> into FRACTION-PART whole, so r1 requires a itself (-0.5, -0.25) while the floor split returns 1 + a
      *> (+0.5, +0.75) and INTEGER-PART must produce a magnitude-zero result whose SIGN factor is -1. Those are
      *> the a = -0.5 and a = -0.25 lines.
      *>
      *> THE RENDERING IS ITSELF ASSERTED: each result is MOVEd to a numeric-edited receiver whose leftmost
      *> symbol is the FIXED INSERTION '+', which by §13.18.40.5 rule 5, Table 8 prints '+' for a positive OR
      *> ZERO value and '-' for a negative one — so the SIGN of every line is pinned, not just its digits.
