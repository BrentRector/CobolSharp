      *> ISO 14.9.25.3 SR10, Table 16 - the ADMITTED cells the PB72/PB59-7 landing must not lose, each the
      *> "Yes" twin of a newly refused "No" cell:
      *> RB: a REF-MOD view is plain class-and-category ALPHANUMERIC (8.4.3.3.4 GR2/GR6 - never the inner
      *>     item's alphabetic/edited row), so an edited item's slice moves to a BOOLEAN receiver - the
      *>     alphanumeric-to-boolean "Yes" cell. Before the fix the inner item's flags rode the view and this
      *>     legal MOVE was refused 0819.
      *> (RA - an ALPHABETIC item's slice into a boolean receiver - was pinned here as admitted from 2026-08-09 to
      *>     2026-08-18; kb/Work PB73 re-adjudicated it: 8.4.3.3.4 GR6's exception list is exhaustive and does
      *>     not name alphabetic, so the view stays ALPHABETIC and Alphabetic -> Boolean is Table 16's "No" - now
      *>     the negative pb73-move-alphabetic-view-to-boolean; --permissive keeps the erasure with a warning.)
      *> XB: FUNCTION CONCAT over plain PIC X arguments is 15.18.4 r3's "otherwise" arm - ALPHANUMERIC -
      *>     and moves to a boolean receiver (the discriminating twin of the rejected all-PIC-A form,
      *>     negative pb59-concat-alphabetic-to-boolean).
      *> MX: a MIXED alphabetic+alphanumeric argument list is likewise the "otherwise" arm - r3 demands
      *>     argument-1 AND all argument-2 be class alphabetic for the alphabetic result.
