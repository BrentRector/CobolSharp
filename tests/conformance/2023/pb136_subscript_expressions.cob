      *> kb/Work PB136 - the subscript splitter and quotient evaluation. (1) The spec's own NOTE 2 form:
      *> a depth-0 '(' after an identifier starts a NEW subscript segment when the name carries no OCCURS
      *> (XCOUNTER), so `DOG (XCOUNTER (- YCOUNTER + 3))` is subscripts [3, 2] -> 77 (it was rejected
      *> with a wrong-subscript-count error); after a TABLE name the '(' is the name's own subscript, so
      *> `DOG (BAKER (I) 3)` stays [BAKER(I), 3] -> 66 (declaration-informed splitting - the ambiguity
      *> 8.4.2.3.2 leaves to the declarations). (2) A quotient-bearing subscript routes to the D18 exact
      *> evaluator unconditionally: (3+4)/2 = 3.5 - with EC-BOUND-SUBSCRIPT checking ON this raises the
      *> GR1b fatal (probed: "subscript value 3.500000000 is not an integer"); checking OFF (here) takes
      *> the DOCUMENTED lenient truncation to occurrence 3 -> 88. The old splice was C# integer division
      *> over long reads - the same 3 by accident of truncation, with no exact evaluation and no raise
      *> ever possible.
