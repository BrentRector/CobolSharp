      *> a numeric data item, a numeric literal, THE FIGURATIVE CONSTANT ZERO
      *> (ZEROS, ZEROES), …" — so `COMPUTE <numeric> = ZERO` is arithmetic-
      *> expression-1 of 14.9.8 Format 1, and 8.3.3.6.4 GR4 makes the figurative

      *> IT WAS REJECTED (fix-queue PB51) with "a boolean COMPUTE expression
      *> shall not consist solely of an ALL literal (14.9.8 Format 2 SR3)" — a
      *> diagnostic naming a construct the source does not contain. A bare ZERO
      *> is adjacent to no operator or paren, so ZeroTokenRewriter leaves it
      *> figurative and Format 1's arithmeticExpression cannot match it; the
      *> parser takes Format 2, whose valueOperand leaf admits the figurative,
      *> and BindBoolExpr then normalises it to the same node ALL B"0" produces.
      *>
      *> The fix is the MIRROR of the F1->F2 re-route the binder already carried:
      *> a Format-2 parse whose source is a bare ZERO and whose receiver is not
      *> boolean is Format 1. The test is on the PARSE TREE, because the bound
      *> node has already lost the distinction.
      *>
      *> ⚙ MEASURED SCOPE: every other arithmetic position already accepted a
      *> bare ZERO — ADD/SUBTRACT/MULTIPLY, the GIVING forms, IF and MOVE each
      *> have their own operand rules admitting the figurative. COMPUTE is the
      *> one verb whose RHS is a bare arithmeticExpression, which is why this is
      *> a targeted re-route and not a grammar change.
