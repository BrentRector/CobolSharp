      *> kb/Work PB321 — a file connector that writes NEITHER a SHARING
      *> clause nor an OPEN SHARING phrase still takes part in the ISO
      *> 14.9.27.4 Table 19 arbitration. 9.1.15 puts the gate on the
      *> physical file, not on the connectors that opted in: "Before access
      *> to a shared physical file is allowed through an OPEN statement, the
      *> sharing mode and the open mode of that OPEN statement shall be
      *> allowed by all other file connectors that are currently associated
      *> with the physical file".
      *>
      *> Such a connector's sharing mode is 9.1.15's implementor default
      *> ("If no specification is made in either location, the implementor
      *> defines the sharing mode in which the file is opened"), which
      *> COBOL.NET has not yet defined (kb/Work PB322). The arbitration
      *> therefore answers a conflict only where EVERY sharing mode the
      *> standard offers gives Table 19's "Unsuccessful open" — which for two
      *> undetermined connectors is exactly 9.1.13.9 1) e), the sub-case that
      *> names no sharing mode at all: "An attempt is made to open a physical
      *> file in the output mode and the physical file is currently open by
      *> another file connector."
