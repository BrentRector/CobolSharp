      *> ISO §14.9.28.3 SR10 — "The words THROUGH and THRU are
      *> equivalent." (FORMAT 1.)
      *>
      *> A rule that states an EQUIVALENCE is directly testable: write
      *> the construct both ways over the same paragraphs and assert
      *> the two results are identical. That is a stronger assertion
      *> than pinning one answer, because it fails if EITHER spelling
      *> drifts. ⛔ Each line also PRINTS the shared value, so the
      *> assertion cannot pass VACUOUSLY — two ranges that both ran
      *> nothing, or both ran the whole source unit, would still print
      *> "OK", and the printed value is what makes that visible.
      *>
      *> The paragraphs add distinct decimal weights (100 / 10 / 1), so
      *> the printed total NAMES the paragraphs that ran:
      *>   FULL  P1 THRU P3 -> 0111 (all three; §14.9.28.4 GR5 b)
      *>         returns "after the last statement of procedure-name-2")
      *>   PART  P1 THRU P2 -> 0110 (P3 must NOT run — a range that
      *>         ran to the end of the source unit would print 0111)
      *>   LOOP  Q1 THRU Q2 UNTIL K > 2 — the range combined with the
      *>         Format-1 until-phrase, so the equivalence is asserted
      *>         where the range is RE-ENTERED. Q2 bumps K, so
      *>         §14.9.28.4 GR10 gives three passes before K > 2 holds:
      *>         3 x 110 = 0330.
      *>
      *> The rule is worded identically in COBOL-85/2002/2014/2023.
