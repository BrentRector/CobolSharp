      *> "The value of argument-1 shall be greater than zero."
      *>
      *> DERIVATION. ISO 15.3: "If the evaluation of an argument
      *> results in an incorrect value for that argument or for the
      *> returned value according to the rules specified in the
      *> function definition and no exception condition was raised
      *> during item identification or expression evaluation, the
      *> EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION exception condition is set to exist."
      *> With checking ON the condition is RAISED, so the USE AFTER
      *> EXCEPTION CONDITION declarative runs and prints CAUGHT. With
      *> checking off 15.3's next sentence hands the result to the
      *> implementor, so the raise is the only spec-fixed observable
      *> and >>TURN is what makes r2 testable at all.
      *>
      *> 1-ZERO is r2's OWN BOUNDARY (zero is not greater than zero);
      *> 2-NEGATIVE is the other violating side. Both owe CAUGHT.
      *> 3-LEGAL-ONE and 4-LEGAL-SMALL satisfy r2, so NO declarative
      *> may fire for them - that contrast is what stops a guard that
      *> raises unconditionally from passing this golden.
      *> Values from ISO 15.55.4 r1, "the approximation of the
      *> logarithm to the base e of argument-1": log-e 1 = 0 exactly,
      *> and log-e of a value in the open interval (0,1) is negative,
      *> so LOG(0.0001) < 0.
      *>
      *> The LOG10 twin of this rule (15.56.3 r2) is already pinned by
      *> pb26_ec_argument_function_every_statement. LOG had no test
      *> for r2: LOG appears in pb19 (LOG(1), the legal side of the
      *> CLASS rule), in pb56 (LOG(1) under standard-decimal) and in
      *> the negative pb62-all-subscript-log (LOG(E(ALL)), which pins
      *> 15.3's ALL-subscript admissibility, not 15.55.3 r2).
