      *> ISO §14.9.28.3 SR7 — "Condition-1, condition-2, … , may be any
      *> conditional expression. (See 8.8.4, Conditional expressions.)"
      *>
      *> This is a PERMISSIVE rule: it does not restrict the UNTIL
      *> slot, it opens it to the WHOLE of §8.8.4. A rule of that shape
      *> is discharged by showing the position is not narrowed, so each
      *> leg below writes a DIFFERENT §8.8.4 form into an UNTIL slot
      *> and prints a value derived from that form's own rules. A slot
      *> narrowed to, say, a simple relation condition would fail to
      *> compile these; a slot that accepted them but evaluated them
      *> wrongly would print a different number. Both failure modes are
      *> visible, which is why every leg prints a COUNT or a settled
      *> operand value rather than an OK/BAD verdict.
      *>
      *> The last leg exercises condition-2, which SR7 names alongside
      *> condition-1, in the AFTER phrase of a varying-phrase.
      *>
      *> The rule is worded identically in COBOL-85/2002/2014/2023.
