      *> kb/Work PB739 - TWO file connectors extending ONE shared
      *> physical file, interleaved WRITE by WRITE, on every organization
      *> and framing that admits the extend mode.
      *>
      *> WHY THIS IS A DIFFERENT TEST FROM pb713_shared_extend_open.
      *> PB713 proved the shared OPEN EXTEND itself succeeds. This proves
      *> what the WRITEs through two such connectors then do, which was
      *> the half left GAP: both reported '00' and one of the two records
      *> was NOT IN THE FILE. GR-14.9.51.4-19 is the row.
      *>
      *> THE RULES.
      *> 14.9.51.4 GR19: "If two or more file connectors for a sequential
      *> file add records by sharing the physical file after opening it in
      *> extend mode, the added records follow the records present in the
      *> physical file when it was opened, but are otherwise in an
      *> undefined order." Both added records shall be in the file, after
      *> the pre-existing one. ONLY THEIR RELATIVE ORDER IS UNDEFINED.
      *> 14.9.51.4 GR12: "The successful execution of a WRITE statement
      *> releases a logical record to the operating environment." A '00'
      *> is a promise that the record is out, not buffered.
      *> 9.1.15 3): "The sharing with all other mode allows concurrent
      *> access to a physical file through other file connectors
      *> specifying input, I-O, or extend mode", and 14.9.27.4 Table 19
      *> makes ALL OTHER/EXTEND against ALL OTHER/EXTEND a Normal open -
      *> so the whole shape is one the standard admits.
      *>
      *> WHAT IS PINNED AND WHAT IS LATITUDE. The COUNT and the PRESENCE
      *> of both added records are the conformance requirement (GR19 +
      *> GR12). Their relative ORDER is GR19's "undefined order" and the
      *> order printed below is this compiler's determinate choice inside
      *> that latitude: GR12 releases each record at its own WRITE, so the
      *> records reach the file in the order the WRITE statements ran.
      *>
      *> RELATIVE. 14.9.51.4 GR29 a): "If the open mode is extend, the
      *> first record released after the OPEN is assigned a record number
      *> that is one greater than the highest relative record number
      *> existing in the physical file. Subsequent records released have
      *> relative record numbers that are ascending ordinal numbers. If
      *> the physical file is shared and the open mode is extend, the
      *> record numbers are not necessarily consecutive." GR31 says it
      *> from the other side: "the relative key values returned are
      *> ascending, but not necessarily consecutive." So A's release over
      *> a file holding RRN 1 is 0002, and B's - taken when the file holds
      *> RRN 2 - is 0003. The number is read from the file AT THE RELEASE.
      *>
      *> INDEXED. 14.9.51.4 GR38: the first record released in the extend
      *> mode "shall have a prime record key whose value is greater than
      *> the highest prime record key value existing in the physical file
      *> when it was opened THROUGH THAT FILE CONNECTOR". Per connector -
      *> so with both connectors opened over a file holding K002, A may
      *> release K006 and B may then release K004, which is lower than
      *> A's and still '00'. That asymmetry is the rule's own wording and
      *> is why the indexed leg writes its keys in DESCENDING order.
