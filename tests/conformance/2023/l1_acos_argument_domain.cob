      *> exception condition EXISTS, so the EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION declarative runs.
      *>
      *> ⛔ AND WHY THIS FILE CANNOT CARRY EDITION 85. >>TURN and the exception-name declarative are
      *> the 2002+ EC model: below --std 2002 a >>TURN is the hard COBOLNET0875, so this program is
      *> not compilable at 85 at all. The row spans 85 through 2023 and ACOS is available from 85,
      *> so the arm that IS observable there - r2's admission of the endpoints - is carried by the
      *> companion 85/l1_acos_domain_accept, and r2's REJECT arm has no spec-fixed observable at
      *> COBOL-85 by any test whatever.
      *>
      *> ⛔ BOTH ARMS, AND BOTH ENDPOINTS. A closed-interval rule is falsified from two directions:
      *> by raising on -1 or +1 (over-rejecting legal source, the shape §15.8.4 r1 then has no
      *> value for) and by staying silent above +1 or below -1. Lines 1-3 are the ACCEPT arm and
      *> 4-7 the REJECT arm. Lines 6-7 sit one unit in the ninth decimal outside each endpoint,
      *> from a runtime data item rather than a literal, so the boundary is measured AT exactly
      *> +/-1 and no constant fold can see the violation.
      *>
      *> The accept arm's values are the mathematical arccosine the rule names, inside §15.8.4
      *> r1's codomain: arccos(+1) = 0, arccos(-1) = pi = 3.14159265358979..., arccos(0) = pi/2 =
      *> 1.57079632679489... §15.4.1 makes a native returned value an implementor-defined
      *> approximation ("When native arithmetic is in effect, the characteristics and
      *> representation of the returned value are defined by the implementor" -- --check OK), so
      *> each is pinned by an inclusive 1E-6 WINDOW - the general_format_intrinsics_batch1
      *> convention - and never by printing this implementation's own digits back at itself.
