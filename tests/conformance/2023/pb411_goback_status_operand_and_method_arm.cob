      *> kb/Work PB411 — THE TERMINATION-STATUS OPERAND, at the edition that introduced it on GOBACK.
      *>
      *> Two rules, one screen, and the golden exists because BOTH were wrong and in OPPOSITE directions.
      *>
      *> LEG 1 — an ALPHANUMERIC GROUP is a legal status operand. ISO 14.9.18.3 syntax rule 6 (and its
      *> word-for-word twin 14.9.42.3 syntax rule 2 for STOP RUN): "Identifier-2 shall reference an integer data
      *> item or a data item with usage display or usage national." 8.5.2.1: "An alphanumeric group item is
      *> treated as though it had a usage of display." The group therefore SATISFIES the second alternative.
      *> Before the fix both verbs rejected it with COBOLNET1704 - a diagnostic quoting the very rule the operand
      *> meets - because the screen asked the item's elementary PICTURE, which a group has none of, and read that
      *> absence as "no usage at all".
      *>
      *> LEG 2 — the METHOD arm owes the same rules. 14.9.18.3's syntax rules carry no context qualifier at all;
      *> only General rules 7, 8, 9 and 10 do, and each of those opens "If the GOBACK ... is executing in a main
      *> program". So a method's GOBACK owes SR6/SR7/SR8 (and the COBOL-2023 introduction gate) in full, and
      *> carries no operating-system indication at all - a method is never a main program. Before the fix the
      *> method arm of the bind read only the RETURNING and RAISING phrases and dropped the status phrase in
      *> silence, so neither the syntax rules nor the edition gate ever ran there.
      *>
      *> WHAT THE OUTPUT PROVES. "IN-METHOD" and "AFTER-INVOKE" prove the method's GOBACK ... WITH ERROR STATUS
      *> compiled (SR6 admits the group) and returned to the INVOKE. The run unit then ends through its own
      *> STOP RUN, so the method's ERROR status is INERT exactly as GR7-GR10 require: the DISPLAY after the
      *> INVOKE is reached, and nothing about the method return indicates an error termination.
      *>
      *> The exit-code half of the rule (14.9.18.4 GR10 / 14.9.42.4 GR5, docs/CONFORMANCE.md item 192's published
      *> determination) is asserted where a golden cannot reach - StopGobackExitCodeTests, which runs the program
      *> and reads its status - because a corpus golden compares stdout only.
