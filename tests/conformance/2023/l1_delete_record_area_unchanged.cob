      *> DEPENDING ON phrase of the RECORD clause associated with

      *> GR8 is not conditioned on success, so the second leg repeats
      *> the reads after an UNSUCCESSFUL delete ('43' - 9.1.13.7 item 3
      *> with 14.9.10.4 GR2: the last I-O statement before a
      *> sequential-access DELETE was not a successful READ).
      *> The "]" terminator pins the FULL 8-character field, so a
      *> blank-fill or a re-splice of the area would show.
