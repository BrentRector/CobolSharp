      *> PB66 / PB98 - DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA (12.3.7.4 GR14 a) exchanges the functions of the comma and the period in

      *> included (8.3.3.3.3: "two fixed-point numeric literals separated by the letter E"), so `1,5E+3` is ONE
      *> literal of value 1500 (PB98: it was a parse error in the procedure division and silently seeded 1 in a
      *> VALUE clause). A floating-point numeric-edited picture written -9,9(5)E+99 has its decimal point at the
      *> comma; 9.999E+99 has the period as a simple-insertion (grouping) character and a four-digit integer
