      *> ISO 5.2.3 — an uppercase word printed WITHOUT an underline is an OPTIONAL WORD: it may be written or
      *> omitted with no change of meaning. Measured off the printed pages rather than assumed, by reading the
      *> underline rectangles per word (scripts/spec/figure_extract.py):
      *>   p732 RECEIVE — RECEIVE, GIVING, CONTINUE, MESSAGE, RECEIVED carry underline rules; FROM carries NONE.
      *>   p756 SEND    — SEND, FROM, RETURNING, RAISING carry rules; TO carries none (both send formats).
      *> The grammar required both tokens, so each line below was a parse error. Sibling of the ON fix
      *> (DEVLOG 1041): same notation rule, different statements, found by the same measurement.
      *> MCS is a recognize-and-name facility here (§4.2.6 ¶3 — see wave_h_facilities_inert), so the observable
      *> behaviour is that the statements COMPILE and are INERT; this golden pins the SYNTAX being accepted.
