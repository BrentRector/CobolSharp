      *> ISO §13.18.40.3 SR5 PICTURE clause — "PIC is an abbreviation
      *> for PICTURE."
      *>   python scripts/spec/cite.py --check 13.18.40.3 "PIC is an
      *>   abbreviation for PICTURE."
      *>   -> OK  §13.18.40.3   (Syntax rules)  [5.]
      *>
      *> DERIVATION. An abbreviation is the SAME word, so the clause is
      *> the same clause however it is spelled and the two spellings
      *> shall be interchangeable in every position the §13.18.40.2
      *> general format allows — including before the optional word IS.
      *> Four entries are written: PIC and PICTURE over one
      *> character-string, then PIC IS and PICTURE IS over another. If
      *> the two spellings are one clause, the pairs are identical data
      *> items, and identity is observable three ways, all displayed:
      *>   size — FUNCTION LENGTH of WS-A and of WS-B is 4 for both,
      *>          because §13.18.40.4 GR4 sizes an item by the number
      *>          of symbols in character-string-1 and both entries
      *>          carry the same character-string;
      *>   category and alignment — WS-A and WS-B are alphanumeric, so
      *>          §14.6.8.5 aligns "AB" at the leftmost character
      *>          position with space fill to the right: [AB  ];
      *>   editing — WS-C and WS-D are numeric-edited, so §14.6.8.2
      *>          rule 5 hands the transfer to §13.18.40's editing
      *>          rules. ZZ9.99 has three integer digit positions and
      *>          two fractional ones; 12.34 aligns on the decimal
      *>          point as 012.34; editing rule 7a replaces the leading
      *>          zero of the Z string with a space and stops at the
      *>          first nonzero numeric character, giving [ 12.34].
      *> A compiler that knew only PICTURE would fail to compile the
      *> WS-A / WS-C entries; one that knew only PIC would fail on
      *> WS-B / WS-D; one that accepted the abbreviation but bound it
      *> to a different clause would print a different length or a
      *> different edited image on one side of a pair.
