      *> kb/Work PB142 - the SECOND-ORDER harm of the manufactured retry
      *> status, made observable. ISO 9.1.13.1 keys the exception-name on
      *> the I-O status FIRST DIGIT: '5' -> EC-I-O-RECORD-OPERATION,
      *> '6' -> EC-I-O-FILE-SHARING. A DELETE FILE blocked by another file
      *> connector is a FILE SHARING conflict (9.1.13.9 item 2 = '62'), so
      *> under EVERY RETRY form -- 14.7.9.3 GR4a and that clause's closing
      *> paragraph both land "the appropriate value ... according to the
      *> rules for 9.1.13", and 9.1.13.9 defines NO deadlock value -- the
      *> condition raised is EC-I-O-FILE-SHARING. The compiler used to
      *> manufacture '52' on the SECONDS/FOREVER arm, which raised
      *> EC-I-O-RECORD-OPERATION instead, so a handler keyed on the file
      *> sharing condition silently did not fire. This fixture is that
      *> handler.
