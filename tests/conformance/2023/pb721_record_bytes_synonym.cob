      *> ISO 13.18.43.3 SR2: "The words BYTES and CHARACTERS are synonymous and may be
      *> used interchangeably." All three general formats of 13.18.43.2 print the same
      *> { BYTES | CHARACTERS } brace group, so the permission covers the fixed clause,
      *> the VARYING clause and the CONTAINS m TO n clause alike - and this program
      *> writes BYTES in all three.
      *>
      *> Until kb/Work PB721 the word had no lexer token at all and the grammar admitted
      *> only CHARACTERS, so every one of these lines was refused COBOLNET1970 ("'BYTES'
      *> is not a clause of the file description entry") - legal COBOL-2023, rejected.
      *>
      *> !! THIS GOLDEN IS 2023-ONLY BY RULE, NOT BY HABIT. The BYTES spelling is a
      *> COBOL-2023 ADDITION: Annex E.3.3 item 13 lists BYTES among the words "added to
      *> the list of context-sensitive words or the context in which they are reserved
      *> has been expanded", and 8.10 gives BYTES exactly ONE construct - the RECORD
      *> clause - so there is no earlier context for the second arm to name. Below 2023
      *> it is refused COBOLNET0900; that is
      *> tests/conformance/negative/pb721-record-bytes-below-2023.cob.
      *>
      *> THE COMPLEMENT IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE RULE, and it is why WS-BYTES is here.
      *> 8.10 lists BYTES as a CONTEXT-SENSITIVE word whose construct is the "RECORD
      *> clause", and 8.10's own sentence says what that means: "If a context-sensitive
      *> word is used where the context-sensitive word is permitted in the general
      *> format, the word is treated as a keyword; otherwise it is treated as a
      *> user-defined word." It is absent from 8.9's reserved-word list at every
      *> supported edition, so `01 WS-BYTES` and a table named BYTES are legal source
      *> that a hard keyword would have broken. That half is edition-INVARIANT, and its
      *> COBOL-85 witness is tests/conformance/85/pb721_bytes_user_word_85.cob: the
      *> clause is gated, the word is not.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES: the clauses are declarations, so the observable is that the
      *> three files compile and round-trip their records exactly as the CHARACTERS
      *> spelling does - F1 writes and reads back a 10-byte record ('00'/'00'), F2 a
      *> 4-byte variable-length one whose length register reads back 0004 per 13.18.43.4
      *> GR15, and the user word named BYTES still holds and subscripts its own data.
