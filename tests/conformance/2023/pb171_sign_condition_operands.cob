      *> kb/Work PB171 - ISO 8.8.4.7.3 SR1 admits "any single numeric data item
      *> described with a usage other than a standard floating-point usage, or any
      *> form of arithmetic expression". These are the shapes that must SURVIVE
      *> the new NonNumericLiteralContext arm, and TWO OF THEM ARE CURRENTLY RIGHT
      *> BY ACCIDENT - which is precisely why they need a golden:
      *>   IF ZERO IS ZERO is TRUE only because the walk's drain returned 0;
      *>   8.8.1.1 names ZERO as the one admissible figurative, so it must stay
      *>   TRUE for the right reason after the fix.
      *> IF A - B IS ... pins the BREADTH-FIRST property (the operand is the WHOLE
      *> expression, SR1) that a depth-first leaf grab would break - the NC250A
      *> IF--TEST-55/56 fact, under its correct clause at last (the code cited
      *> 8.8.4.3, which is the SIMPLE BOOLEAN CONDITION).
