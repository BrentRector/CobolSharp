      *> kb/Work PB492 - CATEGORY NATIONAL-EDITED (ISO 1989:2023 8.5.2.11, 13.18.40.4 GR10).
      *>
      *> 13.18.40.4 GR10: "To define an item as national-edited, character-string-1 shall include
      *> - at least one symbol 'N', and - at least one instance of character-1 or one of the symbols
      *> from the set 'B', '0', '/'." 13.18.40.5 rule 2's Table 7 gives the category exactly ONE type
      *> of editing, "| National-edited | Simple insertion |", and rule 3 says what that does: "Simple
      *> insertion editing results in the insertion character occupying the same character position in
      *> the edited item as the associated symbol occupies in character-string-1." GR1 makes every
      *> symbol representing a character position a NATIONAL character position ("When the usage of the
      *> subject of the entry is national, each symbol representing a character position defines a
      *> national character position"), and GR2 puts the insertion characters in the national form
      *> ("When the usage of the item being edited is national, the value is the national character
      *> representation").
      *>
      *> EVERY expected byte below is computed from GR14's per-symbol text plus rule 3, position by
      *> position - never read off a run:
      *>   N  "Each symbol 'N' represents a national character position that shall contain a character
      *>      from the computer's national character set" - a DATA position, filled from the sending
      *>      operand left to right (14.9.25.4 GR6 a: "alignment and any necessary space filling shall
      *>      take place as defined in 14.6.8").
      *>   B  "Each symbol 'B' represents a character position into which the character space will be
      *>      inserted during editing."
      *>   0  "Each symbol '0' (zero) represents a character position into which the character zero
      *>      will be inserted during editing."
      *>   /  "Each symbol '/' (slant) represents a character position into which the character slant
      *>      will be inserted during editing."
      *> and each of the four "is counted in the size of the item", so NNBNN is FIVE positions and
      *> N(2)B0/N(2) is SEVEN.
      *>
      *>   NEB   NNBNN       <- N"ABCD"  => A B [space] C D              = "AB CD"
      *>   NE0   NN0NN       <- N"ABCD"  => A B [zero]  C D              = "AB0CD"
      *>   NESL  N/N         <- N"AB"    => A [slant] B                  = "A/B"
      *>   NEMIX N(2)B0/N(2) <- N"ABCD"  => A B [space][zero][slant] C D = "AB 0/CD"
      *>   NESH  NNBNN       <- N"AB"    => the sending operand is exhausted after the two leading
      *>         data positions, so 14.6.8 space-fills the remaining ones and the 'B' still inserts
      *>         its space at position 3                                = "AB   "
      *>
      *> Editing applies to EVERY valid elementary move into the item, not only to a literal source:
      *> 14.9.25.4 GR6 - "Any necessary conversion of data from one form of internal representation to
      *> another takes place during valid elementary moves, along with any editing specified for, or
      *> de-editing implied by, the receiving data item." MOVE national -> national-edited is
      *> 14.9.25.3 Table 16's National row against the "National, National-edited" column = Yes.
      *>
      *> INITIALIZE: 14.9.20.4 GR4 - "Otherwise, the implicit statement is: MOVE sending-operand TO
      *> receiving-operand" - and GR6 c)'s table gives receiving operand national-edited the sending
      *> operand "| National-edited | Figurative constant national SPACES |". Because that implicit
      *> statement is a MOVE, GR6's editing applies to it too: the DATA positions take national spaces
      *> and each INSERTION position still takes its own character. NNBNN becomes five spaces (the
      *> 'B' inserts a space where the data would also have been a space), while NN0NN becomes
      *> "  0  " - the zero survives, which is exactly what separates editing from a plain fill.
      *>
      *> VALUE: 13.18.63.3 SR5 - "If the item is of category national or national-edited, literals in
      *> the VALUE clause shall be national literals" - and SR11 - "Editing characters in a picture
      *> character-string for an alphanumeric-edited or national-edited data item do not cause editing of
      *> the initial value when the data item is initialized", with NOTE 3: "The programmer is responsible
      *> for specifying the value of a literal associated with an alphanumeric-edited or national-edited
      *> item in edited form." So VALUE N"AB CD" is stored EXACTLY as written - the 'B' does NOT re-insert
      *> and the data positions are not re-packed - and the image is "AB CD". An ALPHANUMERIC literal
      *> there is SR5's other half and is refused:
      *> conformance:negative/pb492-national-edited-value-literal-class (COBOLNET0898).
      *>
      *> COMPARISON: 8.5.2.1 Table 2 puts category national-edited in class NATIONAL
      *> ("| National | National<br>National-edited<br>Numeric-edited (if usage is national) |"), so
      *> the edited image compares against a national literal with no conversion.
      *>
      *> National-edited data is a COBOL-2002 introduction; the 85 rejection is
      *> conformance:negative/pb492-national-edited-at-85 (COBOLNET0900).
