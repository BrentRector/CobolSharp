      *> kb/Work PB165 - ISO 8.8.4.8.4 GR1c with 14.9.4.4 GR12: forwarding an OMITTED formal parameter as an
      *> argument. GR12 - "If a parameter for which the omitted-argument condition is true is referenced in a
      *> called program, EXCEPT AS AN ARGUMENT or in the omitted-argument condition, the EC-PROGRAM-ARG-OMITTED
      *> exception condition is set to exist" - so this reference form neither raises nor reads. GR1c -
      *> "the result of the OMITTED test is true ... if the argument corresponding to data-name-1 is itself a
      *> formal parameter for which the omitted-argument condition is true" - so the omission is TRANSITIVE,
      *> through any number of forwardings, and independently of the passing mode written on the forward.
      *> Two shapes, both measured WRONG before PB165 (each printed INNER-SEES-PRESENT):
      *>   C  the forward is BY CONTENT - the snapshot read the omitted formal's accessor;
      *>   G  the formal is a GROUP, i.e. NOT carrier-resident - the copy-in field was forwarded, and a fresh
      *>      carrier over a field always answers IsNull false.
      *> The already-landed shape (an elementary formal forwarded BY REFERENCE) is pb133_omitted_transitive.
