      *> ISO §12.4.5.9.4 GR7 — "The implementor shall specify the
      *> maximum number of record locks that may be held by a file
      *> connector; that maximum shall be at least 15. ... Any I-O
      *> statement that attempts to obtain a record lock that would
      *> exceed either limit is unsuccessful and receives an I-O status
      *> that indicates that condition."  COBOL.NET's per-connector
      *> maximum IS 15 (PhysicalFileTable.ConnectorLockMax, the
      *> standard's floor); §9.1.13.8 item 4 prices the denial '54'.
      *>
      *> THE SUBJECT.  Three legs.  Each opens ONE connector under
      *> LOCK MODE IS MANUAL WITH LOCK ON MULTIPLE RECORDS — the only
      *> mode that can reach the ceiling, because §12.4.5.9.4 GR6 makes
      *> single record locking release the prior lock on every I-O
      *> statement, so a single-locking connector never holds more than
      *> one.  Legs R and I are the FORMAT-1 sequential walk on the two
      *> keyed organizations; leg X is the FORMAT-2 random read.
      *> ⛔ THERE IS NO SEQUENTIAL-ORGANIZATION LEG, AND ADDING ONE
      *> WOULD BE NON-CONFORMING SOURCE: §12.4.5.9.3 SR2 — "The MULTIPLE
      *> phrase shall not be specified for a file described with
      *> sequential organization or sequential access mode" — so that
      *> organization can never hold a second lock and the ceiling is
      *> unreachable through it.  That is also why R, I and X all
      *> declare ACCESS MODE IS DYNAMIC.
      *>
      *> READ 15 is the last grant.  READ 16 requests a SIXTEENTH lock
      *> and is refused '54'.
      *>
      *> THE POINT OF THE TEST is the NEXT read.  The '54' READ is
      *> unsuccessful, and it is NOT the record operation conflict
      *> condition: §14.9.30.4 GR9 defines that condition as "the record
      *> identified for access is locked by ANOTHER file connector",
      *> where '53'/'54' are this connector's own lock COUNT.  So
      *> §14.9.30.4 GR10 a)'s "The file position indicator is unchanged"
      *> does not reach it and GR18 applies in full: "Unless otherwise
      *> specified, at the completion of any unsuccessful execution of a
      *> READ statement, the content of the associated record area is
      *> undefined, the key of reference is undefined for indexed files,
      *> and the file position indicator is set to indicate that no
      *> valid record position has been established."  §9.1.13.7 item 6
      *> then reads that state back: "I-O status = 46.  A sequential
      *> READ statement is attempted referencing a file connector open
      *> in the input or I-O mode and no valid next record has been
      *> established because: ... b) The preceding READ statement
      *> referencing that file connector was unsuccessful."
      *> So the read after the denial is '46' — NOT '00' on the record
      *> AFTER the one denied, which is what a denial applied AFTER the
      *> physical retrieval leaves behind: a successfully advanced
      *> position wearing a failure status, silently skipping the record
      *> it failed on (kb/Work PB338).  The UNLOCK between them
      *> (§14.9.47.4 GR1) frees all fifteen locks and is shown to prove
      *> the '46' is the POSITION and not a surviving lock ceiling.
      *>
