      *> kb/Work PB771 — ISO 9.1.15's FILE LOCK is owed by EVERY
      *> organization. 9.1.6: "There are three organizations: sequential,
      *> relative, and indexed", and 9.1.15 3) names none of them — "The
      *> successful opening of a file establishes a file lock for the
      *> applicable sharing rules, thereby preventing other run units from
      *> opening that file with incompatible sharing rules."
      *>
      *> RELATIVE and INDEXED held no host handle at all between OPEN and
      *> CLOSE: their whole record store was loaded at the OPEN and rewritten
      *> at the CLOSE through short-lived bookkeeping handles, so SHARING
      *> WITH NO OTHER — 9.1.15 1)'s "exclusive access to a physical file" —
      *> protected a keyed file from nothing outside the run unit. They now
      *> hold one, postured by 9.1.15's three rules and given back at the
      *> CLOSE ("The file lock is removed by an explicit or implicit CLOSE
      *> statement executed for that file connector").
      *>
      *> A file lock is not observable from inside one run unit — it names no
      *> requester — so what a conformance program can and must certify is
      *> the OTHER half of 9.1.15, which taking a handle could silently
      *> break: the gate INSIDE the run unit stays the file connectors and
      *> Table 19, never the operating environment's handle. "Before access
      *> to a shared physical file is allowed through an OPEN statement, the
      *> sharing mode and the open mode of that OPEN statement shall be
      *> allowed by all other file connectors that are currently associated
      *> with the physical file, as described in 9.1.13, I-O status;
      *> 14.9.27, OPEN statement; and Table 19". (The lock ITSELF is measured
      *> from a handle outside the connector by
      *> FileLockPostureDriftTests.EveryOrganizationHoldsALiveFileLockWhileOpen,
      *> which no COBOL program can express.)
      *>
      *> The legs, and where each expected value comes from:
      *>
      *> L1 — RELATIVE, two connectors that wrote NO clause, one INPUT and
      *> one EXTEND. Their sharing mode is 9.1.15's implementor default,
      *> which COBOL.NET has not determined (kb/Work PB322), so a conflict is
      *> reported only where EVERY candidate mode gives Table 19 an
      *> "Unsuccessful open"; the ALL OTHER candidate gives "Normal open" for
      *> EXTEND against INPUT, so both opens are '00' (14.9.27.4 GR1 with
      *> 9.1.13.2). The WRITE is '00' (14.9.51.4 GR12) and 14.9.51.4 GR29 a)
      *> fixes its record number — "a record number that is one greater than
      *> the highest relative record number existing in the physical file" —
      *> which is 3 over the two seeded records, moved back into the RELATIVE
      *> KEY item by the same rule. The INPUT connector's second READ
      *> delivers the SECOND record: 9.1.12 makes the file position indicator
      *> that connector's own, and a sibling's arrival does not move it.
      *>
      *> L2 — the control that the arbiter is untouched for RELATIVE: against
      *> a connector open SHARING WITH NO OTHER a second OPEN is unsuccessful
      *> with '61' — 9.1.13.9 1) a), "An attempt is made to open a physical
      *> file that is currently open by another file connector in the sharing
      *> with no other mode".
      *>
      *> L3 — INDEXED, the same clause-less reading with the ACCESS axis
      *> moved: an INPUT connector, then an I-O one at DYNAMIC access.
      *> 9.1.15 3)'s ALL OTHER candidate "allows concurrent access to a
      *> physical file through other file connectors specifying input, I-O,
      *> or extend mode", so Table 19 prints "Normal open" and both are '00'.
      *> The WRITE is '00' because 14.9.27.4 GR8's Table 20 lists WRITE under
      *> the I-O column for random and dynamic access, and 14.9.51.4 GR39
      *> lets a dynamic-access indexed WRITE release keys in any order.
      *>
      *> L4 — the same '61' control for INDEXED.
      *>
      *> NREL / NIXD — the records in each physical file afterwards, read
      *> back through a fresh OPEN. 14.9.10.4 GR5's "the physical file" is
      *> ONE medium, so a CLOSE persists what the run unit holds rather than
      *> one connector's snapshot: three records each, the two seeded plus
      *> the one released.
