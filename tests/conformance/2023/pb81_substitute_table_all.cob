      *> PB81 - FUNCTION SUBSTITUTE with a table(ALL) argument. ISO 15.3: "When the definition of a function
      *> permits an argument to be repeated a variable number of times, a table may be referenced by ... ALL ...
      *> the effect is as if each table element ... were specified" - SUBSTITUTE's 15.87.2 format repeats the
      *> PAIR `[ANYCASE] [FIRST|LAST] argument-2 argument-3`, so the enumerated elements form the pairs by position
      *> at RUN time, and a keyword before a table(ALL) attaches to the pair its FIRST element opens (the keywords
      *> precede argument-2). Before this landing the argument was the staged COBOLNET0899. Every expected value is
