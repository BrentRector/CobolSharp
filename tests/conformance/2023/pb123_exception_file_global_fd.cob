      *> kb/Work PB123 — FUNCTION EXCEPTION-FILE naming a CONTAINER's GLOBAL FD from a contained program.
      *> ISO 13.18.30: the file-name of a GLOBAL FD is a global name, visible in every directly/indirectly
      *> contained program (13.18.27 GR1-2); 15.28.3 r1 admits "the name of a file connector that is
      *> specified in an FD statement". BindExceptionFileArg resolved against the program's OWN FD list while
      *> every other file-name site rides FilesByName (into which the binder merges containers' GLOBAL FDs),
      *> so this legal reference drew "not the name of a file connector" — the two-arm-dispatch shape. The
      *> never-touched connector answers 15.28.4 r2a's two spaces. The sweep's sibling rides along: the
      *> UNQUALIFIED LINAGE-COUNTER (8.4.3.14) in the contained program resolves to the container's GLOBAL
      *> LINAGE file — the only LINAGE file visible — instead of drawing "no file description entry contains
      *> a LINAGE clause" (the register's value is not pinned here; its RESOLUTION is the defect).
