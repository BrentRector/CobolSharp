      *> PB7 - a ZERO-ARGUMENT intrinsic in the keyword-omitted form (ISO 12.3.8.1 + 8.4.3.2.3 SR2).
      *> 15.21.2's general format is "FUNCTION CURRENT-DATE" with NO parentheses, so with the keyword
      *> omitted the reference is a BARE NAME - zero suffixes, not one. KeywordOmittedFunction required
      *> exactly one suffix, so every zero-argument intrinsic fell through to a data reference, resolved to
      *> nothing, COMPILED CLEAN and threw NotImplementedCobolFeatureException at RUN TIME. The standard
      *> writes this form itself at D.14.3.6: MOVE FUNCTION LOCALE-DATE (CURRENT-DATE (1:8)).
      *>
      *> Expected values are structural, because the VALUES are a clock and an irrational:
      *>   15.21.3 fixes CURRENT-DATE's length at 21 character positions.
      *>   15.73.3 makes PI an implementor-defined approximation, so the golden pins the leading digits only,
      *>   via a comparison rather than by printing our own double back at ourselves. The bounds are INCLUSIVE
      *>   and the receiver carries 6 decimals on purpose: at 4 decimals pi STORES as exactly 3.1416, so an
      *>   exclusive upper bound of 3.1416 excluded the correct value. A golden must derive how a value is
      *>   STORED, not only what it is.
