      *> PB3 - ORD under a custom PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE, including a character PAST the 256-entry
      *> alphanumeric weights table. ISO 12.3.7.4 GR7 1.3: "Any characters of the native collating sequence
      *> that are not specified in the literal phrase shall assume a position in the collating sequence that
      *> is greater than that of the highest character specified in this literal phrase. The relative order
      *> within the set of these unspecified characters is unchanged from the native collating sequence."
      *>
      *> Derivation for ALPHABET AL IS "A" ALSO "B" (12.3.7.4 GR7 1.6 - ALSO assigns ONE ordinal position):
      *>   {A,B} at 1 · 0x00..0x40 at 2..66 · 0x43..0xFF at 67..255 · then U+0100 at 256, U+0101 at 257.
      *> The old c+1 fallback returned 257 for U+0100, leaving ordinal 256 occupied by nothing - and 15.70.4
      *> r1 returns "the ordinal position", which a sequence containing a hole does not have.
