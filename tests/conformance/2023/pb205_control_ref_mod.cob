      *> from the defect: before kb/Work PB205 the ref-mod was dropped at
      *> capture, so BOTH operands bound to the whole 6-character CX, every
      *> GENERATE broke, and both TYPE CF operands matched control level 0 by
      *> NAME - the minor footing never printed at all.
      *>
      *> It also exercises the two sibling clauses that name a control operand
      *> the same way: 13.18.57.3 SR10 ("Each data-name-1 ... shall be the same
      *> as one of the operands of the CONTROL clause"; ref-mod permitted, same
      *> integer-literal restriction) on each TYPE CF, and 13.18.54.3 SR8 on
      *> SUM ... RESET ON - whose operand is the MAJOR control while the counter
      *> prints in the MINOR footing, the level ordering SR8 requires ("If the
      *> current report group is a control footing, its level of control shall
      *> be a lower level than that of data-name-3").
      *>
      *> The omitted length CX(4:) is 8.4.3.3.2's bracketed [ length ]: the

      *> (8.4.3.3.4 rule 5c), i.e. positions 4-6.

      *> NO PAGE CLAUSE, DELIBERATELY: 13.18.39.4 GR2a - "If integer-1 is not
      *> specified, the report consists of a single page of indefinite length" -
      *> so no page-fit or FIRST DETAIL geometry enters the
      *> expected output and every line below is derived from the CONTROL / SUM
      *> rules alone. The readback SKIPS ALL-SPACE LINES for the same reason, and
      *> that is not cosmetic: this compiler currently places the FIRST body group
      *> one line too low - 13.18.35.4 GR5c gives an unpaged relative group the
      *> line number LINE-COUNTER + integer-2, and 14.9.21.4 GR1b sets
      *> LINE-COUNTER to zero at INITIATE, so LINE PLUS 1 is line 1 and there is
      *> no blank line above it, while the emitted file carries one (the paged
      *> twin of the same +1 is visible in 2002/rw_suppress_bare.out, where
      *> FIRST DETAIL 3 lands the first group on line 4 against GR5b3). That
      *> placement bug is a DIFFERENT mechanism; a witness that leans on a second
      *> gap stops witnessing the moment that gap closes, so this one asserts the
      *> sequence of PRINTED lines and nothing about their vertical position.
