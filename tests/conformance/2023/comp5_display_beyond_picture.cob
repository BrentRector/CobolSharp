      *> holding a beyond-PICTURE value renders the PICTURE-DIGIT IMAGE (the value mod 10^digits),
      *> not IBM's full-container rendering (the vendors are split; 14.9.11.4 GR1 makes the
      *> conversion implementor-defined - CONFORMANCE.md section 7 item 56). The full value remains
      *> reachable through the spec-fixed MOVE path (14.9.25.4 GR6a - the sending size is the digit
      *> count... of the RECEIVER'S width here: PIC 9(20) holds all twenty digits). The R10 golden
      *> deliberately left this unpinned while the question was open; this pins the decision.
