      *> "Argument-2 shall be a value in standard numeric time form."
      *> 15.5.5 defines that form as "a numeric value representing
      *> seconds past midnight", and 7.3.17.4 5) fixes its range:
      *> "When OFF is specified or implied, a standard numeric time
      *> form value shall be greater than or equal to zero and less
      *> than 86,400." No LEAP-SECOND directive is written here, so

      *> VALUE. 15.3 14): "If the evaluation of an argument results in
      *> an incorrect value for that argument ... according to the
