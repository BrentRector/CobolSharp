      *> 15.4 puts a returned value in a temporary elementary data item with the FUNCTION's own characteristics -
      *> nothing in 15.4 or 15.4.1 makes it a property of where the value is going. So the same function

      *> ⛔ THIS GOLDEN EXISTS BECAUSE PB13 BROKE THAT INVARIANT AND A REVIEW REFUTER CAUGHT IT THE SAME DAY.
      *> PB13 made a RECEIVER-LESS float-family render keep its binary64 value instead of quantizing through
      *> CobolIntrinsics#FromDouble - which was correct, and which also silently moved the EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION
      *> raise site out from under that arm, because FromDouble is where an out-of-domain NaN became the 15.3
      *> default result. The two shapes then disagreed:
      *>     COMPUTE R = FUNCTION ACOS(2)   -> the 15.3 default 0     (FromDouble screened the NaN)
      *>     IF FUNCTION ACOS(2) = 0        -> FALSE, a raw NaN       (nothing screened it)
      *> and under EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION checking the receiver-less form raised NOTHING AT ALL, which 14.6.13.1
      *> requires. CobolIntrinsics#RealResult restores the screen on the unquantized arms without re-quantizing.
      *>
      *> ACOS(2) is out of domain by 15.8.3 r2 (argument-1 shall be >= -1 and <= +1); the double result is NaN.
      *> (⚠ r2, NOT r1: 15.8.3 r1 is "Argument-1 shall be of class numeric", a different rule. This comment read
      *>  "r1" until 2026-09-02 while quoting r2's text verbatim - the inherited-citation shape CLAUDE.md rule 1
      *>  names, where --check passes on the TEXT and only the NUMBER is wrong. Both re-derived:
      *>  cite.py --check 15.8.3 "The value of argument-1 shall be greater than or equal to" -> OK 15.8.3 2);
      *>  cite.py --check 15.8.3 "Argument-1 shall be of class numeric." -> OK 15.8.3 1).)
      *> 15.3's closing paragraph makes the value implementor-defined while checking is disabled - this golden
      *> pins that the two SHAPES AGREE, which is the part the standard does fix, not the particular default.
