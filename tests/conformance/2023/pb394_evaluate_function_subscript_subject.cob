      *> per-evaluation residue stage, on CONFORMING SOURCE: a function-bearing subscript in an
      *> EVALUATE selection SUBJECT was refused because this backend re-BOUND the subject once per
      *> selection pair, so the function-identifier's statement-scoped activation would have run once
      *> per WHEN. The subject is now bound ONCE for the statement (ISO 14.9.13.4 GR3 - "At the
      *> beginning of the execution of the EVALUATE statement, each selection subject is evaluated and
      *> assigned a value, a range of values, or a truth value"), which makes the hoist EXACT and the
      *> stage's premise false, so the source compiles and runs.

      *> The construct is legal by 8.4.3.1.2 Format 1 (a function-identifier IS an identifier), 15.4 (its
      *> returned value is a temporary elementary data item), 15.2 (an integer function is class and
      *> category numeric), 8.8.1.1 (an arithmetic expression may be an identifier referencing a numeric
      *> data item) and 8.4.2.3.2 with 8.4.2.3.4 GR1 b) (arithmetic-expression-1 is a subscript).
