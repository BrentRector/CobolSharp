      *>   §14.7.7 2) a) restricts "ADD, DIVIDE, MULTIPLY, and SUBTRACT statements when native arithmetic is in
      *>   effect" — "the composite of operands shall not contain more than 31 digits".  COMPUTE is ABSENT from
      *>   that list of four verbs, and §14.7.7 2) defines the composite as "a hypothetical data item
      *>   resulting from the superimposition of specified operands in a statement aligned on their decimal
      *>   points" — that sentence is rule 2's OWN trailing paragraph, indented level with a) and b) and
      *>   defining the term for both, not part of b); cite.py --check answers "2) b)" only because its
      *>   ordinal tracker carries the last seen letter into an unlettered trailing paragraph.
      *>   §14.9.2.3 1) a) makes ADD format 1's composite "all of the operands in the statement", which
      *>   for `ADD a TO b` includes b — the RECEIVING data item.  One absence therefore covers BOTH halves of
      *>   rule 7, the operand half and the receiving-data-item half.  §14.9.8.3 imposes no composite rule on
      *>   COMPUTE, and §14.9.8.4 GR1 b routes arithmetic-expression-1 to §8.8.1, where rule 7 is the exemption
      *>   ("Otherwise, arithmetic-expression-1 is evaluated to produce an algebraic value according to the
      *>   specifications in 8.8.1, Arithmetic expressions."; cite.py --check reports that text as "1) a)"

      *>   according to rule 1 is then stored", proves it is rule 1's sub-item b); reported with this batch).
      *> THE OPERANDS: L1CA is 18 integer digits and no fraction digits; L1CB is 1 integer digit and 17 fraction
      *> digits.  Superimposed aligned on their decimal points that is max(18,1) + max(0,17) = 35 digits, which
      *> exceeds 31.  So `ADD L1CA TO L1CB` is ILLEGAL — conformance:negative/l1-add-composite-over-31 is the
      *> ARMED COMPLEMENT that pins the rejection over these very pictures — while every COMPUTE below combines
      *> the same operands legally.  Without that complement a green run here would be no evidence at all.
      *> NATIVE arithmetic is in effect (no OPTIONS paragraph, §8.8.1.3), which is the only mode in which
      *> §14.7.7 2) applies and therefore the only mode in which rule 7's exemption has any bite.
      *> THE VALUES avoid §8.8.1.3's implementor-defined intermediate entirely: 7 and 0.5 are exact, every
      *> operation below is an addition, subtraction or multiplication of exact multiples of one half, and no
