      *> THE LOGICAL PAGE BOTH FILES DECLARE. LINAGE IS 2 LINES LINES AT
      *> TOP 3 LINES AT BOTTOM 2. By GR1 the logical page size is the sum
      *> of every phrase but FOOTING: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 lines. By GR8 the
      *> pages are laid contiguously, so page 1 is physical lines 1-7 and
      *> page 2 begins at physical line 8. Within a page: GR4 gives the
      *> top margin the first 3 lines, GR2 gives the page body the next 2
      *> ("the number of lines that may be written or spaced"), GR5 gives
      *> the bottom margin the last 2. So page-1 body lines 1 and 2 are
      *> physical lines 4 and 5; page-2 body lines 1 and 2 are physical
      *> lines 11 and 12. GR7 d) puts the device on body line 1 at OPEN

      *> FILE A — WRITE ... AFTER ADVANCING 1 LINE, three times.
      *> §14.9.51.4 GR25 f) presents the line AFTER the advance and GR7
      *> c) 2 adds the advance to the counter, so:
      *>   W1: counter 1 -> 2, AAAA on page-1 body line 2  = A05.
      *>   W2: the counter would reach 3, past the page size, which is
      *>       §14.9.51.4 GR26 a)'s page overflow; with the AFTER phrase
      *>       "the device is repositioned to the first line that may be
      *>       written on the next logical page and the logical record is
      *>       presented on that line" — page-2 body line 1 = A11 — and
      *>       GR7 c) 4 resets the counter to one.
      *>   W3: counter 1 -> 2, CCCC on page-2 body line 2 = A12.
      *> FIVE blank lines therefore separate AAAA from BBBB (A06-A10):
      *> page 1's bottom margin (2, GR5) plus page 2's top margin (3,
      *> GR4). A compiler that keeps the margins in the counter but not
      *> on the medium writes ONE line there and fails at A06.
      *>
      *> FILE B — the LINE SEQUENTIAL arm, plain WRITE, three times. The
      *> page geometry is the same; what differs is GR25 e) — the line is
      *> presented and the advance follows — so the records sit one line
      *> earlier than file A's: AAAA on page-1 body line 1 = B04, BBBB on
      *> body line 2 = B05, and BBBB's own advance overflows (GR26 a)) to
      *> page-2 body line 1, where CCCC lands = B11. This file exists
      *> because the two WRITE arms are a two-arm dispatch and only the
