      *> ⛔ THE ARITHMETIC MODE IS THE BRANCH, and it is the arm the corpus did not have. §15.27.3
      *> has three rules, one per mode, and only two were witnessed: 2023/exp_standard_decimal_eae

      *> negative/standard-binary-e-2014 / -2002 pin the r2 arm's decline and its edition gate.
      *> r1 - the DEFAULT mode, the one every program without an OPTIONS paragraph gets - had no
      *> golden at all, so the rule that governs the ordinary case was the untested one.
      *>
      *> ⚠ WHAT MAY AND MAY NOT BE ASSERTED HERE. r1 fixes WHAT is approximated and says nothing
      *> about HOW CLOSELY; §15.4.1 then leaves the representation to the implementor. So the
      *> value is pinned by WINDOWS around the constant the rule itself writes, never by printing
      *> this implementation's digits back at itself. And §15.4.1's sentence "the returned value
      *> is the same for all instances of a given function within a single execution" is NOT
      *> available here: its paragraph opens "When standard-decimal arithmetic or standard-binary
      *> arithmetic is in effect", so it answers a different question than the native mode's.
