      *> ISO §14.9.21.4 GR3: "The INITIATE statement does not open any file connector with which report-name-1
      *> is associated. Therefore, the INITIATE statement may be executed only if the corresponding file
      *> connector is open in the extend mode or the output mode. If the file connector is not open in the
      *> output or extend mode, the EC-REPORT-FILE-MODE exception condition is set to exist and no action is
      *> taken on the report."  That is the DETECTION half of §14.9.27.4 GR7 ("The OPEN statement for a report
      *> file connector shall be executed before the execution of an INITIATE statement that references a
      *> report-name that is associated with file-name-1"); the other half — that nothing opens a report file
      *> connector implicitly — holds by construction.  Table 13 makes EC-REPORT-FILE-MODE Fatal, so under
      *> >>TURN … CHECKING ON the declarative runs and RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT (§14.9.33) keeps the run alive.
      *>
      *> THREE ARMS, because the rule turns on the pair (is open, in which mode) and not on either alone:
      *>   1. NOT OPEN AT ALL          -> EC-REPORT-FILE-MODE.  "No action is taken on the report", so §14.9.21.4
      *>      GR4 never places it in the active state, and the TERMINATE that follows is therefore itself
      *>      unsuccessful with EC-REPORT-INACTIVE (§14.9.46.4 GR1) — the witness that GR3's "no action" held.
      *>   2. OPEN, BUT IN THE INPUT MODE -> EC-REPORT-FILE-MODE.  An open-ness test alone would pass this.
      *>   3. OPEN OUTPUT, then OPEN EXTEND -> both legal; GR3 names the two modes and this pins BOTH.
      *> Before kb/Work PB326 the condition was a catalogue row with no raise site anywhere in src: every arm
      *> here INITIATEd silently and each GENERATE wrote into a connector that was not open.
