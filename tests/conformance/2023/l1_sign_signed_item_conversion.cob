      *> ISO §13.18.52.4 GR7 — a picture containing 'S' makes the item a
      *> SIGNED item, and where a SIGN clause applies, conversion needed for
      *> computation or comparison happens AUTOMATICALLY.
      *>
      *> THE RULE. §13.18.52.4 GR7: "Each numeric item whose picture
      *> character-string contains the symbol 'S' is a signed item. If a SIGN
      *> clause applies to such an item and conversion is necessary for
      *> purposes of computation or comparisons, conversion takes place
      *> automatically."
      *> Two obligations: SIGNEDNESS (the item can carry and be compared as a
      *> negative value), and AUTOMATIC CONVERSION (no source-level step is
      *> required to make two DIFFERENT sign layouts compare or combine).
      *>
      *> HOW THE SECOND OBLIGATION IS MADE OBSERVABLE. A conversion claim is
      *> vacuous unless the two operands really are stored differently, so A1
      *> and B1 carry the SAME value in two layouts that §13.18.52.4 GR6
      *> defines completely and differently:
      *>   GR6 a) "The operational sign is presumed to be the leading (or,
      *>          respectively, trailing) character position of the data item
      *>          to which it applies; this character position is not a digit
      *>          position."
      *>   GR6 b) "The operational signs for positive and negative are the
      *>          basic special characters '+' and '-', respectively." (The
      *>          printed standard sets that second character as an en dash;
      *>          the basic special character it names is Table 1's "minus
      *>          sign (hyphen)", §8.1.3.1 — U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS.)
      *> so A1 (LEADING SEPARATE) is [-012] and B1 (TRAILING SEPARATE) is
      *> [012-] — the sign character sits at opposite ends. Both are 4 bytes:
      *> 3 digit positions plus the separate sign character position, at one
      *> byte per character position (docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-209). The
      *> IMG leg prints both images, so the later legs cannot be satisfied by
      *> two items that happened to be stored identically.
      *> The unseparate (over-punch) form is deliberately avoided: its
      *> representation is the §13.18.52.4 GR4 implementor determination and
      *> has no docs/CONFORMANCE.md A.1 row yet.
      *>
      *> THE LEGS.
      *> IMG — the two layouts, derived above. This leg alone would pass with
      *>       no conversion machinery at all; it exists to make EQ/NEG/SUM
      *>       non-vacuous.
      *> EQ  — GR7's COMPARISON half, and §8.8.4.2.4 is the clause that makes
      *>       the conversion NECESSARY: "For operands whose class is numeric,
      *>       a comparison is made with respect to the algebraic value of the
      *>       operands regardless of the manner in which their usage is
      *>       described." Both hold -12, so YES. An implementation comparing
      *>       the stored characters answers NO — [-012] and [012-] agree in
      *>       no character position.
      *> NEG — GR7's first sentence. 'S' makes each item signed, so each holds
      *>       a genuinely negative value and A1 < 0 AND B1 < 0 is true. An
      *>       implementation storing the magnitude only answers NO.
      *> SUM — GR7's COMPUTATION half, into a THIRD layout. -12 + -12 = -24;
      *>       C1 is PIC S9(4) SIGN IS TRAILING SEPARATE, so by GR6 a) it is
      *>       4 digit positions plus a trailing sign character position and
      *>       by GR6 b) the negative sign is '-': [0024-]. Three different
      *>       sign layouts take part in one statement with no source-level
      *>       conversion written anywhere.
      *> Every image is read through a GROUP move to an alphanumeric item,
      *> which §14.9.25.4 GR4 makes a byte transfer rather than a numeric
      *> conversion, so the printed characters are the stored ones.
