      *>  . 14.9.14.4 GR7 - D1-LAST's EXIT SECTION passes control "to an unnamed empty paragraph immediately
      *>    following the last paragraph of the current section, preceding any return mechanisms for that
      *>    section", so D1-TAIL never runs and the USE return mechanism fires.
      *>  . 14.9.49.4 GR12 - "control is transferred to the invoking routine in the input-output control
      *>    system", and then GR12 b): the I-O status does not indicate a fatal EC-I-O condition, so control is
      *>    returned to an implicit CONTINUE following the READ => AFTER-READ FS=10.
