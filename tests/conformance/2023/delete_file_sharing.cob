      *> P10 Step 8: the DELETE FILE file-sharing conflict (ISO 9.1.13.9
      *> item 2 / 14.9.10 GR15): a DELETE FILE attempted while the
      *> physical file is currently open by ANOTHER file connector is
      *> unsuccessful with I-O status 62 and the file is not deleted; a
      *> RETRY phrase re-attempts and EVERY form exhausts to 62 -- 14.7.9.3
      *> GR4a and that clause's closing paragraph both land "the appropriate
      *> value ... according to the rules for 9.1.13", and 9.1.13.9 defines
      *> no deadlock value for a FILE SHARING conflict (52 is 9.1.13.8's
      *> RECORD-conflict value). FOR 0 SECONDS (GR4a's zero screen) and FOR
      *> 30 SECONDS (GR2's maximum-meaningful clamp, which this
      *> implementation defines as 0) must therefore AGREE. After the other
      *> connector closes: delete -> 00; an absent file -> the SUCCESSFUL
      *> 05 (GR14); the deleted file's OPEN INPUT -> 35. The conflict is
      *> defined over "another file connector" plainly, so two ordinary
      *> (non-SHARING) SELECTs bound to one physical file exercise it.
