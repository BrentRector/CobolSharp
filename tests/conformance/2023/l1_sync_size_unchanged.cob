      *> ISO §13.18.55.4 GR6 — any storage-position adjustment the
      *> SYNCHRONIZED clause causes does NOT change the SIZE of the
      *> synchronized item itself.
      *>
      *> THE RULE. §13.18.55.4 GR6: "Any adjustment in storage position
      *> resulting from the SYNCHRONIZED clause does not affect the size of
      *> the synchronized data item."
      *> GR2 is what makes the rule non-trivial: it reserves the bytes
      *> "between the leftmost and rightmost natural boundaries delimiting
      *> this data item" and says "If the number of bytes required to store
      *> this data item is less than the number of bytes between those natural
      *> boundaries, the unused bytes or portions thereof shall not be used
      *> for any other data item" — and then GR2 a) and b) put those unused
      *> bytes in the size of the CONTAINING group and in a REDEFINES of it.
      *> GR6 is the boundary of that: the containing group may grow, the
      *> SYNCHRONIZED ITEM may not.
      *>
      *> WHAT THIS MEASURES, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE EXISTING WITNESS. The
      *> shipped golden conformance:2002/l1_byte_length_implicit_filler
      *> measures the GROUP's byte length around a synchronized item (its
      *> SYNC=3 leg, §13.18.55.4 GR9 b). GR6 is about the synchronized ITEM's
      *> own length, so every leg below applies FUNCTION BYTE-LENGTH
      *> (§15.14.1, "an integer equal to the length of the argument in bytes")
      *> to the ELEMENTARY item, never to its group.
      *>
      *> THE SHAPE OF EACH LEG. Each pair is the same description twice, once
      *> with the clause and once without, and each is preceded inside its
      *> group by a one-byte item so that a natural-boundary adjustment WOULD
      *> be needed if the implementation performed one. GR6 requires the two
      *> numbers to agree; the no-clause twin is the reference GR6 names.
      *>
      *> THE ABSOLUTE NUMBERS, DERIVED.
      *> COMP  — docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-205 (the §13.18.60.4 GR4
      *>         determination): a BINARY/COMP item of 3-4 digits occupies
      *>         2 bytes. So 2, with the clause and without it.
      *> SEP   — §13.18.52.4 GR6 a): with SEPARATE CHARACTER the operational
      *>         sign "is presumed to be the leading ... character position of
      *>         the data item ...; this character position is not a digit
      *>         position", so PIC S9(4) SIGN IS LEADING SEPARATE is 4 digit
      *>         positions plus one more character position = 5, at one byte
      *>         per character position (DOC-A.1-209). So 5 and 5 — the
      *>         separate sign position is not disturbed by the clause.
      *> ALNUM — DOC-A.1-209, one byte per character position: PIC X(3) is 3.
      *>         §13.18.55.3 SR1 permits the clause on any elementary item, so
      *>         an alphanumeric carrier is in scope.
      *> LR    — GR4 ("SYNCHRONIZED LEFT ... will begin at the left byte of
      *>         the natural boundary") and GR5 ("SYNCHRONIZED RIGHT ... will
      *>         terminate on the right byte of the natural boundary") are the
      *>         two forms that name a boundary explicitly, and GR6 says
      *>         "ANY adjustment", so both must still answer 2.
      *>
      *> WHAT WOULD BREAK IT. An implementation that padded a synchronized
      *> item out to its natural boundary and counted the pad in the ITEM's
      *> length would answer COMP=4 2 or LR=4 4; one that placed a
      *> SYNCHRONIZED RIGHT item by left-padding it inside its own extent
      *> would answer LR=2 4. Both are printed differences.
