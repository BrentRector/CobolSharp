      *> kb/Work PB346 — §14.9.30.4 GR9 bound to §14.7.9, on the RECORD
      *> OPERATION conflict class, through BOTH READ formats.
      *>
      *> GR9: "If the RETRY phrase is specified, additional attempts may be
      *> made to read the record as specified in the rules in 14.7.9, RETRY
      *> phrase. If the RETRY phrase is not specified or the record is not
      *> successfully accessed as specified by the RETRY phrase, the record
      *> operation conflict condition exists. The I-O status is set in
      *> accordance with the rules for the RETRY phrase."
      *>
      *> Every holder here is a file connector of the EXECUTING run unit, and
      *> a connector cannot release a lock while another statement of the same
      *> run unit is executing, so every retry form exhausts. What differs is
      *> WHERE each form lands, and the four answers are four different rules:
      *>
      *>   no phrase        14.7.9.3 GR4 a) -> 9.1.13.8 item 1 = '51'
      *>   0 / -3 TIMES     GR4 a) ("arithmetic-expression-1 ... negative or
      *>                    zero")                                     = '51'
      *>   2 TIMES          GR4 b) -> GR1, count exhausts -> the clause's
      *>                    closing paragraph -> 9.1.13              = '51'
      *>   0 / -5 SECONDS   GR4 a) ("arithmetic-expression-2 ... negative or
      *>                    zero")                                     = '51'
      *>   30 SECONDS       GR4 b) -> GR2. The implementor "shall specify the
      *>                    maximum meaningful value of arithmetic-
      *>                    expression-2"; COBOL.NET defines it as ZERO
      *>                    (Annex A.1 item 166, docs/CONFORMANCE.md §7), so
      *>                    the timeout temporary holds a zero-length period,
      *>                    no attempt is made in it, and the closing
      *>                    paragraph lands the same             = '51'
      *>   FOREVER          GR4 b) -> GR3, "until the input-output operation
      *>                    has been completed" — which here never happens, so
      *>                    it is the deadlock 9.1.13.8 item 2 leaves the
      *>                    implementor to detect (A.1 item 109)      = '52'
      *>
      *> The 0-SECONDS / 30-SECONDS PAIR is the point: they agree, and they
      *> agree with 0 TIMES. 2023/pb142_retry_conflict_class_ec pins the same
      *> pair on the FILE SHARING class ('62'); nothing pinned it on the
      *> RECORD class, and nothing passed a RETRY phrase to a READ at all.
      *> The SECONDS amounts are DATA ITEMS, not literals, so GR4 a)'s "result
      *> of the evaluation" is a genuine runtime evaluation.
