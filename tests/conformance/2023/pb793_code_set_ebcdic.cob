      *> a coded character set on the storage medium to the native character set during input operations,
      *> and from the native character set to the coded character set on the storage medium during output
      *> operations" - and GR6: "a) On input, each coded character from the storage medium is replaced with
      *> its associated native coded character as defined in the alphabet being used. b) On output, each
      *> native coded character in the record is replaced for the storage medium with its associated coded
      *> character as defined in the alphabet being used."
      *>
      *> The alphabet is the EBCDIC code-name (12.3.7.3 SR15 / 12.3.7.4 GR7 i; owner decision kb/Work
      *> PB793), whose correspondence with the native character set is IBM CCSID 37. Before PB793 the only
      *> coded character sets a CODE-SET clause could name here were the ones whose correspondence IS the
      *> identity, and everything else was the documented Annex A A.3 item 27 non-support (COBOLNET1672).
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED FROM CCSID 37 AND NOTHING ELSE. "AB012" written through CODE-SET IS A-EBC

      *>   ROUNDTRIP - reading the same file back through the same clause restores the native characters
      *>     (GR6 a undoes GR6 b), so R2 is "AB012".
      *>   MEDIUM - the same physical file read through FR, a file description with NO CODE-SET clause, is
      *>     13.18.13.4 GR7's default ("If the CODE-SET clause is not specified, the native character set is
      *>     assumed for data on the external media"): the bytes arrive unconverted, and FUNCTION ORD gives
      *>     each one's 1-based native ordinal - 194, 195, 241, 242, 243. THIS LEG IS WHAT MAKES THE
      *>     ROUNDTRIP EVIDENCE: without it, a compiler that converted on NEITHER side would also print
      *>     "AB012" and pass.
