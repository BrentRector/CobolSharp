      *> returned value is the name of the runtime element that activated the

      *>   CURRENT     returned the CALLER's name, not the running element (r7)
      *>   ACTIVATING  returned the SINGLE SPACE r5 reserves for a MAIN PROGRAM -
      *>               the method claimed to be one
      *>   STACK       omitted the method entirely (r9)

      *> THE FORMER JUSTIFICATION CITED REAL RULES THAT DO NOT GOVERN: r3 is about
      *> elements that are NOT COBOL runtime elements, and r4 is about the FORM of
      *> the name - it even lists "method-id" among the forms an implementor may
      *> return, which presumes the element is on the stack. Latitude over which
      *> name string, never over whether the frame exists.
