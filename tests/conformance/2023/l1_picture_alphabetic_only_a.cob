      *>                   at least two different symbols from this

      *> §14.6.8.5 truncates "ZZZ" on the right to Z.
      *> Line 2 (after REPLACING ALPHANUMERIC DATA BY "###") reads
      *> A2=[ZZZ] S2=[Z] X2=[###] M2=[###]: the complement is written
      *> and the alphabetic items are untouched.
      *> The two lines together are what makes the test an ONLY test —
