      *> STANDARD-1 = the 128 ISO/IEC 646 IRV characters (the identity on U+0000-U+007F); a literal-phrase alphabet's
      *> set contains EVERY native character (GR7 k4 - the unspecified characters are IN the set at remapped
      *> positions), so membership of it is true for any content; GR1 makes a zero-length operand false; GR2 NOT.

      *> What each line proves:
      *>   STD-ASCII=yes  - "Hi!" is all ISO 646.
      *>   STD-ACCENT=no  - an accented letter (U+00E9) is outside STANDARD-1's 128.
      *>   NOT-STD=yes    - the NOT form reverses (GR2).
      *>   REV-ANY=yes    - a literal alphabet's coded character set is total (GR7 k4), whatever its sequence.
      *>   STD-SPACE=yes  - space IS an ISO 646 character (membership, not the ALPHABETIC letter rule).
