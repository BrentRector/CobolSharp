      *> kb/Work PB761 — a condition-name THROUGH range over a NATIONAL
      *> conditional variable is CONFORMING SOURCE and is implemented.
      *> It used to be refused by a COBOLNET0899 "recognized but not yet
      *> implemented (Phase 4a residue)" stage citing 13.18.63 SR31 —
      *> but SR31 reads "Alphabet-name-1 may be specified only when the
      *> literals specified in the THROUGH phrase are of class
      *> alphanumeric or national", which governs when the
      *> IN alphabet-name-1 phrase may be written and says nothing about
      *> implementability.  SR29 bans THROUGH for a BOOLEAN subject and
      *> for no other category.
      *>
      *> What actually governs the range is 14.7.8 rule 2 — "When the
      *> range of values is defined by alphanumeric or national
      *> literals, the range of values depends on the collating sequence
      *> used for evaluation of the range" — reached from 8.8.4.5.3 GR2,
      *> "The rules for comparing a conditional variable with a
      *> condition-name value are the same as those specified for
      *> relation conditions", which sends a national subject to
      *> 8.8.4.2.9's NATIONAL program collating sequence.
      *>
      *> The two alphabets are declared with OPPOSITE orders so no leg
      *> can pass for the wrong reason (12.3.6.4 GR9/GR10 install both;
      *> 12.3.7.4 GR7 k)3 puts every unlisted character above both).
      *>   REV-AN  "CBA"   -> alphanumeric  C(0) < B(1) < A(2)
      *>   REV-NAT N"ABC"  -> national      A(0) < B(1) < C(2)
      *> Every expected value is DERIVED, not measured.
      *>
      *>  V01 THE DISCRIMINATOR, ELEMENTARY.  EN is PIC N(3) holding
      *>      N"CCC"; its 88 range is N"AAA" THRU N"CCC".  Under REV-NAT
      *>      that is ascending and EN equals its upper bound -> Y.
      *>      Under REV-AN the same two literals are INVERTED (A is 2,
      *>      C is 0), so the range is empty and the answer would be N.
      *>      Before PB761 this entry did not run at all: it was
      *>      REFUSED at COBOLNET0899.
      *>  V02 THE SECOND DISCRIMINATOR, in the other direction.  E3 is
      *>      N"AAA" and its range is N"AAA" THRU N"BBB": under REV-NAT
      *>      ascending with E3 at the LOWER bound -> Y; under REV-AN
      *>      inverted and therefore empty -> N.
      *>  V03 THE AGREEMENT 8.8.4.2.1 REQUIRES: the identical range over
      *>      a GROUP-USAGE NATIONAL subject, which "shall be treated as
      *>      an elementary national data item" (13.18.29.4 GR2b gives
      *>      it the as-if PICTURE N(3)) -> Y, the same as V01.
      *>  V04 THE OUT-OF-RANGE CONTROL.  E2 holds N"CCC" against the
      *>      range N"AAA" THRU N"BBB"; under REV-NAT C(2) is above the
      *>      upper bound B(1) -> N.  Without it every national leg
      *>      could be vacuously true.
      *>  V05 THE OVER-FIX GUARD.  An ALPHANUMERIC elementary item must
      *>      stay on the ALPHANUMERIC sequence (8.8.4.2.7).  AE holds
      *>      "CCC" and its range is "AAA" THRU "CCC": under REV-AN that
      *>      range is inverted and therefore empty -> N.  A change that
      *>      moved the alphanumeric side to REV-NAT would answer Y.
