       *> Four of the five id paragraphs state the AS-literal rule as "shall be an
       *> alphanumeric literal or a national literal and shall be neither a figurative
       *> constant nor a zero-length literal" (11.10.3 SR1, 11.5.3 SR1, 11.6.3 SR1,
       *> 11.7.3 SR1).  11.3.3 SR1 states it WITHOUT the zero-length half: "shall be an
       *> alphanumeric literal or a national literal and shall not be a figurative
       *> constant."  Verified against the PRINTED page, not the transcription.
       *>
       *> So a zero-length AS literal on CLASS-ID is LEGAL and this program compiles and
       *> runs, while negative/pb303_as_literal_zero_length rejects the identical literal
       *> on PROGRAM-ID.  Without this golden the shared screen could silently reject it
       *> everywhere and every other test would stay green - the rejecting side is the
       *> side tests naturally cover.
