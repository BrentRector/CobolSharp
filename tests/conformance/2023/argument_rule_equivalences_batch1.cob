      *> Two ARGUMENT RULES adjudicated CONFORMS with no spec-derived test, so each stayed a GAP:
      *> AR-15.19.3-2 (CONVERT) and AR-15.25.3-3 (DAY-TO-YYYYDDD). Both rules state an EQUIVALENCE, which is
      *> directly testable: write the construct both ways and assert the results are identical. That is a
      *> stronger assertion than pinning one literal answer, because it fails if EITHER spelling drifts - and
      *> it needs no knowledge of what the shared answer is. ⛔ Each line also PRINTS the shared value, so
      *> the assertion cannot pass VACUOUSLY - an equality test that compared two empty or two identically
      *> broken results would still print "OK", and the printed value is what makes that visible.
      *>
      *>   15.19.3 r2 - "ALPHANUMERIC and ANUM are equivalent. NATIONAL and NAT are equivalent." Per 15.19.2
      *>                those words appear in BOTH the source-format and the destination-format, so the
      *>                equivalence is asserted in both positions. (The destination-format is TWO words - one
      *>                of {ALPHANUMERIC|ANUM|NAT|NATIONAL} followed by the required word HEX - or the single
      *>                word BYTE; a bare HEX destination is not legal and is not what this tests.)
      *>   15.25.3 r3 - "If argument-2 is omitted, the function shall be evaluated as though 50 were specified
      *>                for argument-2." Argument-2 is the windowing cut, so the omitted and explicit-50 forms
      *>                are compared on BOTH sides of 50 and at the boundary itself. A single sample above or
      *>                below the cut would pass while the windowing was wrong.
