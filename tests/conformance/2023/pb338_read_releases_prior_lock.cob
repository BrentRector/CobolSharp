      *> ISO §14.9.30.4 GR11 a) — "If single record locking is specified
      *> for the file connector associated with file-name-1, any prior
      *> record lock associated with that file connector is released BY
      *> THE EXECUTION OF THE READ STATEMENT."  §12.4.5.9.4 GR6 states
      *> the same rule for every verb: "Execution of any I-O statement
      *> except START releases any previously locked record in that file
      *> for that file connector."
      *>
      *> THE RULE IS TIED TO EXECUTION, NOT TO SUCCESS, and the standard
      *> qualifies DELIBERATELY in the very same general rule where it
      *> means to: GR11 b) releases "at the completion of the SUCCESSFUL
      *> execution of the READ statement", GR11 c) and d) speak of "a
      *> SUCCESSFULLY ACCESSED record".  GR11 a) carries no such
      *> qualifier.  An at end READ is an executed I-O statement, so it
      *> releases (kb/Work PB338).
      *>
      *> THE SUBJECT.  Three legs, one per ORGANIZATION — record
      *> sequential, relative and indexed — differing in NOTHING but the
      *> ORGANIZATION clause.  Three records; two connectors A and C on
      *> one physical file, both SHARING WITH ALL OTHER and LOCK MODE IS
      *> MANUAL, which §12.4.5.9.4 GR6 makes SINGLE record locking (the
      *> LOCK ON phrase omitted).
      *>
      *> A1..A3 are three READ ... WITH LOCK.  Under single record
      *> locking each releases the one before it, so after A3 the
      *> connector holds exactly ONE lock: the THIRD record's.
      *>
      *> C1..C3 walk the same file through the other connector.  C3 is
      *> the CONTROL: the third record is locked by another file
      *> connector, so §14.9.30.4 GR9 + §9.1.13.8 item 1 make it '51'
      *> and GR10 a) leaves C's file position indicator unchanged.
      *>
      *> A4 is the SUBJECT.  It is a plain READ that finds no next
      *> record: §14.9.30.4 GR24 sets '10' and "When the at end
      *> condition exists, execution of the READ statement is
      *> unsuccessful."  GR11 a) fires anyway, so A's lock on the third
      *> record is gone.
      *>
      *> C4 proves both halves at once: it is the SAME statement as C3
      *> and it now answers '00' with the third record — the lock was
      *> released by A's FAILING read (GR11 a), and C could still reach
      *> that record because its own '51' had not moved its position
      *> (GR10 a).
      *>
      *> EXPECTED, derived before it was observed:
