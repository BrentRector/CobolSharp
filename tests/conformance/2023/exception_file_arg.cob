      *> FUNCTION EXCEPTION-FILE(file-connector-name) — the COBOL-2023 file-connector
      *> argument form (ISO §15.28.4 r2; Annex E.3.3 item 25). It reports the NAMED
      *> connector's current I-O status + SELECT-spelled file-name (r2b), or two
      *> alphanumeric spaces when the connector was never opened/attempted/accessed
      *> (r2a) — unlike the no-argument form, which reports the LAST exception. Here
      *> INF is written, then read to end-of-file (I-O status '10'), so
      *> EXCEPTION-FILE(INF) is "10INF"; UNUSED is only SELECTed, never touched, so
      *> EXCEPTION-FILE(UNUSED) is two spaces.
