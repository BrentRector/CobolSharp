      *> ISO §14.9.28.3 SR1 — "If neither the TEST BEFORE nor the TEST
      *> AFTER phrase is specified, the TEST BEFORE phrase is assumed."
      *>
      *> The rule is a DEFAULT, so it is observable only on a program
      *> shape that tells the two assumptions apart. Every loop below
      *> enters with its condition ALREADY TRUE and never changes it,
      *> which §14.9.28.4 GR10 splits exactly:
      *>   "If the condition is true when the PERFORM statement is
      *>   entered, and the TEST BEFORE phrase is specified or implied,
      *>   no transfer to the specified set of statements takes place"
      *>       -> the body runs ZERO times;
      *>   "If the TEST AFTER phrase is specified, the PERFORM statement
      *>   functions as if the TEST BEFORE phrase were specified except
      *>   that the condition is tested after the specified set of
      *>   statements has been executed"
      *>       -> the body runs EXACTLY ONCE.
      *> So SR1 holds iff DEF equals BEFORE (0) and differs from
      *> AFTER (1). All three counts are PRINTED on every line, so the
      *> assertion cannot pass vacuously: a carrier whose loops never
      *> ran at all would print 0 0 0, and one whose loops always ran
      *> once would print 1 1 1. Neither is the derived answer.
      *>
      *> SR1 is a FORMATS 1 AND 2 rule, so all THREE carriers of the
      *> optional WITH TEST phrase are measured — the §14.9.28.2
      *> until-phrase in its inline (Format 2) and out-of-line
      *> (Format 1) positions, and the varying-phrase, which prints the
      *> WITH TEST bracket of its own.
      *>
      *> The VARYING legs also print the induction variable.
      *> §14.9.28.4 GR13 a) sets it to 9 first; GR13 d) then leaves it
      *> with "the value it contained when condition-1 was evaluated"
      *> and GR13 b) with "the value it contained at the completion of
      *> the execution of the specified set of statements" — the body
      *> never touches it, so every leg ends at 009 and the difference
      *> between the arms is the COUNT alone.
      *>
      *> The rule is worded identically in COBOL-85/2002/2014/2023 and
      *> nothing here is edition-conditioned, so one 2023 program
      *> discharges the whole edition window.
