      *> ISO §14.9.19.3 SR3 (FORMAT 2) — "The ELSE NEXT SENTENCE phrase
      *> may be omitted if it immediately precedes the terminal
      *> separator period of the sentence."
      *> SR3 is a PERMISSION, not a constraint: it forbids nothing, it
      *> obliges the implementation to accept BOTH spellings in that one
      *> position and to give them the SAME meaning. Its testable
      *> content is therefore an EQUIVALENCE, and each W-/O- pair of
      *> lines below is one half of it.
      *> The two meanings are computed independently from the general
      *> rules of §14.9.19.4:
      *>   written form, condition FALSE — GR6: "the THEN phrase is
      *>     ignored and control is transferred to an implicit CONTINUE
      *>     statement immediately preceding the next separator period";
      *>   omitted form, condition FALSE — GR7: "the THEN phrase is
      *>     ignored";
      *>   either form, condition TRUE — GR3: statement-1 runs and "The
      *>     ELSE phrase, if specified, is ignored".
      *> In the position SR3 names, the phrase sits on the terminal
      *> period of its own sentence, so both forms continue with the
      *> next sentence and the W- and O- lines must pair up exactly.
