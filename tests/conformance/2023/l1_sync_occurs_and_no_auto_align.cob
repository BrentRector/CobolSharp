      *> ISO §13.18.55.4 GR8 + GR10 — the SYNCHRONIZED clause inside a table
      *> applies to EVERY occurrence (and its implicit FILLER is generated per
      *> occurrence), and the OPTIONAL automatic alignment GR10 offers is not
      *> specified by this implementor, so nothing is aligned without the
      *> clause either.
      *>
      *> THE RULES.
      *> §13.18.55.4 GR8: "When the SYNCHRONIZED clause is specified in the
      *> data description entry that contains an OCCURS clause, or in the data
      *> description entry of a data item subordinate to the data description
      *> entry that contains an OCCURS clause, then: a) The SYNCHRONIZED
      *> clause applies to each occurrence of the data item. b) Any implicit
      *> FILLER generated for other data items within that same table is
      *> generated for each occurrence of those data items (see General rule
      *> 9b)."
      *> §13.18.55.4 GR10: "An implementor may optionally specify automatic
      *> alignment for any internal data representations except for bit data
      *> items and, within a record, data items described with usage display
      *> or national. A record itself may be automatically synchronized."
      *>
      *> THE DETERMINATION THESE TWO REST ON, docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-195
      *> (the §13.18.55.4 GR9 obligation, Annex A.1 item 195): COBOL.NET
      *> performs NO physical alignment for SYNCHRONIZED and generates NO
      *> implicit FILLER for it — and "GR10's optional automatic alignment is
      *> not specified, so nothing is aligned without the clause either", and
      *> "GR8 b)'s per-occurrence FILLER is vacuous inside a table". Annex A.1
      *> item 7 makes GR10's documentation obligation optional ("This item is
      *> optional. This item, if provided by the implementor, shall be
      *> documented"), and declining the option is a conforming choice — so
      *> what a golden owes here is the DOCUMENTED choice measured, not a
      *> layout invented to match the code.
      *>
      *> ⚠ WHAT GR8 a) CAN AND CANNOT DISCRIMINATE, SAID PLAINLY. With zero
      *> filler generated anywhere, an occurrence carrying the clause is laid
      *> out exactly like one that does not, so applying GR8 a) to every
      *> occurrence and applying it to none are the same program. This golden
      *> does NOT claim to separate a) from a vacuous a). What it does
      *> separate is the SHAPE: an implementation that aligned the binary leaf
      *> and applied that per occurrence answers SUBORD=12, and one that
      *> applied it to the first occurrence only answers SUBORD=10. The
      *> vacuity itself is earned elsewhere, by the SYNC=3 leg of the shipped
      *> conformance:2002/l1_byte_length_implicit_filler, which rules out a
      *> 2-byte alignment for exactly this carrier.
      *>
      *> THE NUMBERS.
      *> SUBORD — GR8's SECOND entry point, the clause on an item SUBORDINATE
      *>   to the OCCURS entry. One occurrence is PIC X + PIC S9(4) COMP =
      *>   1 + 2 (DOC-A.1-209 one byte per character position; DOC-A.1-205 a
      *>   3-4 digit COMP item is 2 bytes) = 3, and three occurrences are 9.
      *>   The second number is the clause-free twin, which GR8 read against
      *>   the item-195 determination requires to agree.
      *> ONOCCURS — GR8's FIRST entry point, the clause written IN the entry
      *>   that carries the OCCURS clause. One byte of prefix plus three
      *>   2-byte COMP occurrences = 1 + 6 = 7, and again its clause-free
      *>   twin. THE ONE-BYTE PREFIX IS WHAT MAKES THIS LEG ABLE TO FAIL —
      *>   without it the occurrences sit on even offsets already (0, 2, 4),
      *>   so an implementation that aligned every occurrence would answer 6
      *>   too and the leg would measure nothing; with the prefix, a 2-byte
      *>   per-occurrence alignment answers 8.
      *> ONE — one occurrence's shape declared OUTSIDE any table: 3. Together
      *>   with SUBORD=9 this is 3 x 3, i.e. the per-occurrence extent inside
      *>   the table is exactly the extent outside it — the arithmetic GR8 b)
      *>   would break if a per-occurrence FILLER were generated.
      *> AUTO — GR10's FIRST sentence, with NO SYNCHRONIZED clause anywhere in
      *>   the group: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. An implementor who had elected automatic
      *>   alignment for binary would answer 5 or 6 (a pad before the COMP
      *>   item, and a trailing pad if the record were rounded too).
      *> AUTO8 — the same question on the widest carrier, USAGE BINARY-DOUBLE,
      *>   8 bytes (DOC-A.1-207): 1 + 8 + 1 = 10. This is the leg an
      *>   8-byte-boundary alignment policy would answer 17 or 24 on, so it is
      *>   where an automatic-alignment election would be hardest to hide.
      *> REC — GR10's SECOND sentence, "A record itself may be automatically
      *>   synchronized", is NOT observable through a length function, and
      *>   THIS LEG MAKES NO CLAIM ABOUT IT. Automatic synchronization of a
      *>   record is a PLACEMENT (the record begins on a natural boundary),
      *>   and GR6 — "Any adjustment in storage position resulting from the
      *>   SYNCHRONIZED clause does not affect the size of the synchronized
      *>   data item" — keeps the size constant under any such adjustment, so
      *>   an implementor who HAD elected record synchronization would still
      *>   report 3. What REC=3 does exclude is the one shape of that election
      *>   a length CAN see: a policy that padded a record out to a natural
      *>   boundary would answer 4 or 8. Where a record-level rule would
      *>   really show is the file-record legs of
      *>   conformance:2023/l1_sync_file_record, which answer 4/4 with no
      *>   padding.
