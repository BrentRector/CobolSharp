      *> ISO 8.3.3.5.2 Format 2 (hexadecimal-national, NX"...") and 8.3.3.4.2
      *> Format 2 (hexadecimal-boolean, BX"...") had NO lexer rule at all
      *> (fix-queue R03). The lexer's own comment said so: "NX"..." (hex
      *> national) is deferred" / "BX"..." (hex boolean) is deferred".
      *>
      *> THE FAILURE WAS A SILENT WRONG ANSWER, not a parse error. `NX` lexed as
      *> an IDENTIFIER and `"0041"` as a separate string, so in an argument list
      *> one literal became TWO operands. With a data item actually named NX in
      *> scope, nothing complained at all:
      *>     01 NX PIC X(4) VALUE "ZZZZ".
      *>     MOVE FUNCTION MAX(NX"0041") TO R.     *> gave ZZZZ, silently
      *> which is MAX(NX, "0041") - an unrelated item compared against a string.
      *>
      *> THE FIX FOLDS FORMAT 2 INTO THE EXISTING TOKEN rather than adding a new
      *> one, because that is what the standard says: 8.3.3.5.4 GR2 and 8.3.3.4.4
      *> GR2 are ALL-FORMATS rules putting both formats of each literal in one
      *> class and category. 32 call sites already route NATLIT to national and
      *> BOOLLIT to boolean, and all of them stay correct untouched - including
      *> the COBOL-2002 introduction gate, which assertions 9-10 of the negative
      *> fixture r03-hex-national-literal-at-85 pin.
