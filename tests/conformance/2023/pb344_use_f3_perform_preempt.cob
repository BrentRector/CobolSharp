      *> kb/Work PB344 — the ISO edition the compilation targets reaches the file connectors and the
      *> generated USE-declarative selector.  Until PB344 no edition reached either, so the 2023 rules
      *> were served to --std 85, 2002 and 2014 as well.
      *>
      *> THE RULES, and every expected value below derived from them (no observation):
      *>  14.9.49.4 GR6's leading clause — "If the input-output statement that raised the exception was
      *>    specified in imperative-statement-1 of an exception-checking PERFORM statement and the exception
      *>    condition did not match the criteria in any WHEN phrase" — the USE declarative is selected only on
      *>    the NO-MATCH side.  Q1 is the match side (the WHEN runs, the declarative does not); Q2 is the
      *>    no-match side (the declarative runs).
      *>  14.9.30.4 GR24 a) — the at end condition sets '10' and raises EC-I-O-AT-END (9.1.13.1).
      *>  14.9.33.4 GR2 — RESUME NEXT STATEMENT continues with the statement following the raising one, which
      *>    is why Q1-AFTER follows Q1-WHEN.
      *>
      *> EDITIONS: 2023 only — the exception-checking PERFORM is a 2023 facility (Annex E.2 item 19 b) calls
      *> the READ half of this change "part of the inline-exception-checking PERFORM enhancement"), so this
      *> program has no earlier-edition copy.  kb/Work PB344 closes GR-14.9.49.4-6's untested half with it.
