      *> ISO §14.9.49.3 SR6 — "The words ERROR and EXCEPTION are synonymous and may be used
      *> interchangeably." (FORMAT 1.) Two declaratives differ in NOTHING but that one word: the
      *> two files are declared identically, both are provoked by the identical statement, and
      *> both handlers do the identical thing. If the two spellings were not one statement form,
      *> the EXCEPTION-spelled section could not be a Format 1 file-exception declarative and the
      *> HANDLER-VIA-EXCEPTION line could not appear.
      *> DERIVATION — every expected line follows from the rule text, nothing from the compiler.
      *>  · §14.9.6.4 GR1 — "If the file connector is not open, the CLOSE statement is
      *>    unsuccessful and the I-O status indicator for the file connector is set to '42'";
      *>    §9.1.13.7 rule 2 names the same value for "a CLOSE or UNLOCK statement … attempted
      *>    for a file connector that is not in an open mode". Neither file is ever opened.
      *>  · §14.9.49.4 GR6 a) — "If file-name-1 is specified, the associated procedure is
      *>    executed when the condition described in the USE statement occurs" — runs each
      *>    file-scoped declarative once, so both handler lines appear, each reporting 42.
      *>  · SR6 is what makes the second declarative a Format 1 USE at all; therefore the
      *>    ERROR leg and the EXCEPTION leg must be byte-identical but for the tag.
      *>  · Control returns by §14.9.33.4 GR2 a) (RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT), so the AFTER-
      *>    lines show the same 42 the handler saw — the two spellings agree after the
      *>    declarative as well as inside it.
