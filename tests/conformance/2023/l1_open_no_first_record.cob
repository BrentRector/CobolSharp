      *> ISO §14.9.27.4 GR9 — "Execution of the OPEN statement does not
      *> obtain or release the first record."
      *> Two observable halves, one per verb of the rule.
      *> OBTAIN. FA holds REC001, REC002. If the OPEN had obtained the
      *> first record, the first READ after it would deliver REC002.
      *> It delivers REC001, and the second READ delivers REC002, so
      *> the OPEN consumed nothing. The third READ is the at end
      *> condition, '10' (§9.1.13.4 item 1a) — the file really held two
      *> records, not three.
      *> RELEASE, on an EMPTY file. FB is opened OUTPUT and closed with
      *> no WRITE between. §14.9.27.4 GR18: "After the creation of the
      *> file, the file contains no records" — the OPEN released none
      *> from the record area — so the first READ after re-opening it
      *> is immediately at end, '10'.
      *> RELEASE, on a NON-empty file. FA is opened EXTEND and closed
      *> with no WRITE between. Had that OPEN released a record, FA
      *> would now hold three; it still holds exactly REC001, REC002
      *> and then at end.
      *> Every OPEN below is on an available file or creates one, so
      *> each reports '00' (Table 18 + §9.1.13.2 item 1).
