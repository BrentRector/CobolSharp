      *> the data "is adjusted downward by the offset values to
      *> represent UTC"; 2) - a minus sign means it "is adjusted
      *> upward". 15.41.3 4) makes argument-3 "an integer
      *> representation of offset from UTC expressed in minutes", so a
      *> positive argument-3 subtracts and a negative one adds.

      *> WHY A CROSSING MUST NORMALIZE. 15.3.3.3 confines the hours
      *> subfield of the data to "a value from 00 to 23 inclusive" and
      *> the minutes subfield to 00..59, so the only representation of
      *> an adjustment that leaves the day which the format can hold
      *> at all is the congruent time of day.
      *>   R1  3600 = 01:00:00 with +120: 01:00:00 - 02:00 is one hour

      *>       inside the day, so R1/R2 cannot be read as a lost offset

      *> 15.41.4 3) - with an OFFSET format "the value in argument-2
      *> is reflected directly in the time portion of the returned
      *> value, and the offset in argument-3 is reflected directly in
      *> the offset portion". No adjustment at all. The two ENDS of
      *> the interval are where a leaked UTC adjustment would have to
      *> wrap and so become unmistakable. 15.3.3.6.1 gives the offset
      *> subformat of a basic offset time format as "five characters:
      *> a plus sign; two lowercase 'h' characters ... and two
      *> lowercase 'm' characters", so 300 minutes renders +0500 and
      *> -300 renders -0500.
      *>   R4  86399 = 23:59:59 with -300  -> "235959-0500"

      *>       not appear in the data associated with a basic common
      *>       time format with fractional seconds representation", so
      *>       the two fraction digits (.8124... -> 81) abut the
      *>       seconds: "05142781+0500". That is also the answer Annex
      *>       D.31.5.6 states for these exact three arguments; the
      *>       annex is INFORMATIVE, so the expectation is derived
      *>       from the normative rules and D.31.5.6 is corroboration
      *>       - but it is the one datetime worked example of the
      *>       standard's own that nothing ran FORWARD (pb23 runs
      *>       D.31.5.8 and D.31.5.9, both of them inverses).
      *>       WARNING: D.31.5.6 also asserts that for a UTC or offset
      *>       format "the third parameter is required (although it
      *>       may be zero)". That contradicts the NORMATIVE 15.41.3
      *>       6), which says an omitted argument-3 "shall be
      *>       evaluated as though 0 were specified". The normative
      *>       rule governs, and R7/R8 pin it.

      *> of the format in argument-1 is a UTC format or an offset
