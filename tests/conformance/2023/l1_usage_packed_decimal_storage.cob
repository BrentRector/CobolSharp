      *> ISO §13.18.60.4 GR11 — USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL: computer storage allocation, alignment
      *> and representation of data (Annex A.1 item 215; docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-215).
      *>
      *> THE RULE. §13.18.60.4 GR11: "The USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL clause specifies that a radix
      *> of 10 is used to represent a numeric item in the storage of the computer.
      *> Furthermore, this clause specifies that each digit position shall occupy the minimum
      *> possible configuration in computer storage. Each implementor specifies the precise
      *> effect of the USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL clause upon the alignment and representation of
      *> the data item in the storage of the computer, including the representation of any
      *> algebraic sign. Sufficient computer storage shall be allocated by the implementor to
      *> contain the maximum range of values implied by the associated decimal picture
      *> character-string. If the WITH NO SIGN phrase is specified the representation of the
      *> data item in the storage of the computer reserves no storage for representing any
      *> sign value."
      *>
      *> W - THE WIDTH, derived from GR11's own two constraints. "Each digit position shall
      *>     occupy the MINIMUM POSSIBLE CONFIGURATION" makes a radix-10 digit a 4-bit nibble
      *>     (ten values need four bits, and a byte holds two of them); "sufficient computer
      *>     storage ... to contain the maximum range" then fixes the byte count:
      *>       d digits + one sign nibble  -> ceil((d+1)/2) = d/2 + 1 bytes (integer divide)
      *>       d digits, WITH NO SIGN      -> ceil(d/2) bytes, since the phrase "reserves no
      *>                                     storage for representing any sign value".
      *>     S9(3)=2, S9(4)=3, S9(5)=3, 9(4)=3, 9(3) NO SIGN=2, 9(4) NO SIGN=2.
      *>     Note the CONTROL in that list: at 3 digits the two forms occupy the SAME 2 bytes
      *>     (123 is X"12 3C" signed and X"01 23" unsigned-no-sign), so only the EVEN digit
      *>     counts discriminate the phrase — a width table that ignored WITH NO SIGN would
      *>     still answer 2 for 9(3) and is caught only by the 9(4) pair, 3 against 2.
      *> DIG - the digit nibbles themselves: BCD, TWO DIGITS PER BYTE, most significant first,
      *>     left-padded with a zero nibble when the digit count is even. 1234 is X"01" X"23"
      *>     ahead of its sign nibble. FUNCTION ORD is 1-based (§15.70.1 "The lowest ordinal
      *>     position is 1") so the bytes read 1+1 = 2 and 35+1 = 36. A digit-per-byte (zoned)
      *>     representation answers 49 50 here; a low-order-first one answers 53 36.
      *> SGN - GR11's "representation of any algebraic sign": a TRAILING sign nibble in the low
      *>     half of the last byte. X"D" negative, X"C" positive, X"F" for an item with no
      *>     operational sign — the last digit byte is therefore X"4D" / X"4C" / X"4F", i.e.
      *>     ORD 78 / 77 / 80. Three legs so the sign is measured, not assumed present.
      *> NOSGN - the WITH NO SIGN branch: every nibble is a digit and there is no sign nibble
      *>     at all, so 1234 is exactly X"12" X"34" -> ORD 19 and 53. If the phrase were
      *>     ignored the two bytes would be X"01" X"23" (ORD 2 and 36) plus a third.
      *> ALIGN - GR11's "alignment" obligation. COBOL.NET's determination is NO alignment: the
      *>     packed leaf starts at the next byte with no implicit FILLER, so X(1) + S9(4)
      *>     PACKED-DECIMAL is 1 + 3 = 4. An implementation aligning it would answer more.
      *> RT - the same bytes decode back to the same value, sign included, and leave the
      *>     neighbouring character leaf intact. The bytes are reached by a group move to an
      *>     alphanumeric item, which §14.9.25.4 GR4 makes a byte transfer ("treated exactly
      *>     as if it were an alphanumeric to alphanumeric elementary move").
