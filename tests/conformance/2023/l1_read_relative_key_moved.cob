      *> ISO §14.9.30.4 GR25 — "For a relative file, if the RELATIVE KEY
      *> clause is specified for file-name-1, the execution of a READ
      *> statement moves the relative record number of the record made
      *> available to the relative key data item according to the rules
      *> for the MOVE statement."
      *> The key item is clobbered with 9999 before EVERY read, so the
      *> value printed after each one can only have come from the store
      *> GR25 mandates; K1/K2/K3 must be 0001/0002/0003.
      *> K4 is the at end read.  GR25's subject is "the record MADE
      *> AVAILABLE" and GR24 makes an at end execution unsuccessful, so
      *> no record is made available and no store is owed: the key item
      *> must still read 9999.  An implementation that stored the file
      *> position indicator unconditionally would print 0003 there.
      *> GR25 is a FORMAT 1 rule (it sits under the Format-1 heading
      *> with GR19-GR27); the Format-2 random read makes the key item
      *> the SOURCE instead (GR29), so every read below is sequential.
