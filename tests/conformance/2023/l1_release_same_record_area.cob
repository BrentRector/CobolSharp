      *> ISO §14.9.32.4 GR3 — RELEASE under SAME RECORD AREA: the released logical record STAYS
      *> available in the record area (the "unless … SAME RECORD AREA clause" branch of sentence 1)
      *> and is ALSO available as a record of the other file named in that clause (sentence 2).
      *> DERIVATION — every expected line follows from the rule text, nothing from the compiler.
      *>  · §12.4.6.4.4 GR2: a record-area format SAME clause makes the listed files "share a
      *>    memory area for processing the current logical record … equivalent to an implicit
      *>    redefinition of the area with records aligned on the leftmost byte position", and the
      *>    area is available "when any file connector referenced by file-name-1, file-name-2, …
      *>    is open" — hence OUTF is opened before the SORT and stays open across both phases.
      *>  · §14.9.32.4 GR3 sentence 1: because SRTF is named in a SAME RECORD AREA clause, the
      *>    release does NOT withdraw the record — SRT-REC still reads the eight bytes released
      *>    (R1-SRT / R2-SRT).
      *>  · §14.9.32.4 GR3 sentence 2: the same logical record is available as a record of the
      *>    other file referenced in that clause — OUT-REC reads the identical eight bytes
      *>    (R1-OUT / R2-OUT), leftmost-aligned, so OUT-KEY/OUT-TXT overlay SRT-KEY/SRT-TXT.
      *>  · §14.9.32.4 GR2 + §14.9.40.4 GR8 a) + §14.9.34.4 GR3: the records really were released
      *>    to the sort, so the output procedure returns them by ASCENDING SRT-KEY — "the record
      *>    containing the key data item with the lower value is returned first" — AAA then BBB.
      *>    Without this leg a compiler that made RELEASE a no-op would still pass the two
      *>    availability checks above.
