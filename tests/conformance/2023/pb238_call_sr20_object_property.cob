      *> kb/Work PB238 - ISO 14.9.4.3 SR20's carve-out, the leg that had no arm at all: "BY CONTENT shall
      *> not be omitted when identifier-4 is an identifier that is permitted as a receiving operand, EXCEPT
      *> that BY CONTENT may be omitted when identifier-4 is an object property."
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED:
      *>  IN=00100 - 14.9.4.4 GR9 a)'s test is SYNTAX RULE 3 ("an address-identifier or a data item defined
      *>    in the file, working-storage, local-storage, or linkage section"). An object property is none of
      *>    those, so a)1 does not apply and a)2 assumes BY CONTENT; 8.4.3.9.4 GR1/GR2 then make the sending
      *>    occurrence a GET, which yields the declared VALUE 100 through the PIC 9(5) formal.
      *>  AFTER=00100 - 14.2.3 GR9 allocates the BY CONTENT record so that it "does not occupy the same
      *>    storage area as the argument", and SR17 makes identifier-4 a SENDING operand, so the callee's
      *>    MOVE 777 reaches only that record. The property's SET accessor is NOT invoked. Before PB238 the
      *>    bare argument bound BY REFERENCE, BoundStores classified the occurrence ReadWrite, and the SET
      *>    ran: this same source printed AFTER=00777 (measured, by disabling the arm and rebuilding).
