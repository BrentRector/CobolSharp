      *> kb/Work PB367b - THE 14.9.49.4 GR3 SELECTION TIERS, AND TIER ORDER BEATING SOURCE ORDER.
      *> GR3: "A declarative is selected for execution by analyzing the USE statements in the source element in
      *> the order in which they are specified. The first declarative that satisfies the selection criteria is
      *> executed and no other declaratives are executed. ... Otherwise, the following rules are applied in
      *> order: ... c) All format 3 USE statements in which file-name-2 is specified and exception-name-2 is a
      *> level-3 exception-name are examined. ... d) ... file-name-2 is specified and exception-name-2 is a
      *> level-2 exception-name ... e) ... file-name-2 is not specified and exception-name-1 is a level-3
      *> exception-name ... f) ... file-name-2 is not specified and exception-name-1 is a level-2 exception-name
      *> ... g) Any format 3 USE statements in which file-name-2 is not specified and exception-name-1 is a
      *> level-1 exception-name ...". Each tier ends "If no qualifying USE statement is found, the USE
      *> statements in the source element are examined AGAIN" - so the tiers are a cascade over the WHOLE
      *> declarative set, and a later-declared declarative in an earlier TIER beats an earlier-declared one in a
      *> later tier. The six declaratives below are written in the reverse of the tier order precisely so that
      *> source order cannot produce these answers.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED LINES, DERIVED FROM THE RULES:
      *>  . 14.6.13.1.6 Table 13 / 14.6.13.1.1 - EC-I-O is a level-2 name, EC-I-O-AT-END a level-3 name under
      *>    it; EC-BOUND is level-2 with EC-BOUND-OVERFLOW under it; EC-ALL is the single level-1 name.
      *>  . READ F1 past the end: 9.1.13 gives I-O status 10 and, with checking on, EC-I-O-AT-END is raised
      *>    (9.1.13.1). Tier c) finds D-C (EC-I-O-AT-END FILE F1) - the LAST declarative in source order =>
      *>    TIER-C. 14.9.49.4 GR12 b) then returns control after the READ (status 10 is not fatal).
      *>  . READ F2 past the end: no tier-c candidate names F2, so the cascade re-examines and tier d) finds
      *>    D-D (EC-I-O FILE F2) => TIER-D.
      *>  . READ F3 past the end: no file-scoped candidate names F3; tier e) finds D-E (EC-I-O-AT-END) =>
      *>    TIER-E.
      *>  . MOVE 22 TO WS-E (5): 8.5.1.9.6 GR1 raises the nonfatal EC-BOUND-OVERFLOW on the first implicit
      *>    crossing of the expected capacity 4. No declarative names that level-3 name, so tiers c/d/e find
      *>    nothing and tier f) finds D-F (EC-BOUND) => TIER-F. The declarative completes normally and the
      *>    growth proceeds, so WS-E (5) holds 22 (this is also the row that proves the RUNTIME-site raise
      *>    reaches the tiers at all - kb/Work PB367b).
      *>  . IF INV-RANGE: 14.7.8 rule 2 raises the nonfatal EC-RANGE-INVALID for a THROUGH range whose
      *>    starting value collates after its ending value. Nothing names EC-RANGE-INVALID or EC-RANGE, so the
      *>    cascade reaches tier g), where BOTH D-G1 and D-G2 qualify: GR3's "in the order in which they are
      *>    specified" and "the first declarative that satisfies the selection criteria is executed and no
      *>    other declaratives are executed" select D-G1 => TIER-G1 and no TIER-G2 line. Execution then
      *>    proceeds as if the range were empty (rule 2), so the ELSE branch runs.
      *>  . 14.9.49.3 SR14 bounds the duplication that is illegal - "The same pair of exception-name-2 and
      *>    file-name-2 shall not be specified in more than one USE statement within the same procedure
      *>    division" - and says nothing about exception-name-1, which is why two EC-ALL declaratives are legal
      *>    source and why GR3 has to say which of them wins.
