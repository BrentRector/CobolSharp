      *> ISO §14.9.28.4 GR10 — the until-phrase's four sentences, one
      *> leg each. (FORMATS 1 AND 2.)
      *>
      *> S1 "the specified set of statements is performed until the
      *>    condition specified by the UNTIL phrase is true. When the
      *>    condition is true, control is transferred to the end of the
      *>    PERFORM statement." LOOPN counts up to 3 and the body runs
      *>    exactly 3 times — not 2 (an off-by-one exit) and not 4 (a
      *>    test that ran after the condition already held).
      *>
      *> S2 "If the condition is true when the PERFORM statement is
      *>    entered, and the TEST BEFORE phrase is specified or
      *>    implied, no transfer to the specified set of statements
      *>    takes place, and control is passed to the end of the
      *>    PERFORM statement." GUARD is 1 and nothing changes it, so
      *>    the body must run ZERO times — asserted inline AND
      *>    out-of-line, the two carriers of the same phrase.
      *>
      *> S3 "If the TEST AFTER phrase is specified, the PERFORM
      *>    statement functions as if the TEST BEFORE phrase were
      *>    specified except that the condition is tested after the
      *>    specified set of statements has been executed." Same
      *>    already-true condition, so the body must run EXACTLY ONCE —
      *>    again on both carriers. S2 and S3 together are what make
      *>    each other non-vacuous.
      *>
      *> S4 "Item identification associated with the operands specified
      *>    in condition-1 is done each time the condition is tested."
      *>    The condition is WE (WK) = 9 and the BODY advances WK, so
      *>    a subscript resolved once at entry would read WE (1) = 0
      *>    for ever and never terminate. WE (3) is the only 9, so the
      *>    identification-per-test reading gives exactly 2 passes and
      *>    leaves WK at 3.
      *>
      *> The rule is worded identically in COBOL-85/2002/2014/2023.
