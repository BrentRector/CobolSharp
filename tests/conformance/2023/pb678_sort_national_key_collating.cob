      *> THIS FILE PINS GR5a - THE STATEMENT PHRASE - FOR A **FILE** SORT (Format 1). Before
      *> kb/Work PB678 the file sort carried ONE sequence and compared every key's RECORD-IMAGE
      *> BYTES under it, so a class-national key was doubly wrong:
      *>   1. its window was its CARRIER width (n) over an image whose basis is BYTES (2n for a
      *>      national position - 13.18.60.4 GR8, D-N1), so PIC N(1) keys all collapsed onto the
      *>      shared high byte U+0000 and compared EQUAL - a stable sort returning the RELEASE
      *>      order; and
      *>   2. what it did compare was weighed by the ALPHANUMERIC sequence.
      *>
      *> THE THREE ORDERS ARE DELIBERATELY ALL DIFFERENT so no leg can pass for the wrong reason:
      *> native is A < B < C; REV-AN ("CBA") is C < B < A; REV-NAT (N"BAC") is B < A < C. A leg
      *> answering with another leg's order is a visible failure.
