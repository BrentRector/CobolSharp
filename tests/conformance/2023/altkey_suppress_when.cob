      *> ISO §12.4.5.6 SUPPRESS WHEN phrase of the ALTERNATE RECORD KEY clause
      *> (COBOL-2023; Introduction p.27 / Annex E.3.3 item 42). literal-1 is the
      *> key suppression value: when a record's alternate key equals it, that
      *> record's ALTERNATE access path is withheld (§12.4.5.6.4 GR6) and the
      *> record "is not considered to exist" for READ/START on that key (GR6 NOTE)
      *> — but the record itself, and its PRIME-key path, are unaffected.
      *> Record 02 has alternate key "XX" = the suppression value. Reading on the
      *> ALTERNATE key returns only 01 and 03; reading on the PRIME key returns
      *> all three (01, 02, 03). Greenfield-only (the legacy has no SUPPRESS WHEN).
