      *> LEG A (ACCESS SEQUENTIAL, GR2 - the deleted record IS the one
      *> at the FPI): READ3 must be R003. A DELETE that invalidated the

      *> RELATIVE KEY item and is NOT the one at the FPI): deleting RRN
      *> 4 while the FPI holds 2 leaves the FPI at 2, so GREAD3 is S003
      *> and the following READ is the at-end '10' (RRN 4 is gone).
