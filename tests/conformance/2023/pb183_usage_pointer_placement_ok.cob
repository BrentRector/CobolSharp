      *> kb/Work PB183 - the POSITIVE witnesses for both arms ISO 13.18.60.3 SR14 admits, plus the
      *> level-77 determination the screen rests on. These matter MORE than the negative fixtures:
      *> the hazard of a placement screen is over-rejection.
      *>
      *> ARM 1 - "an elementary data item at level 1": P01 / OBJ01 / PP01.
      *>
      *> LEVEL 77 SATISFIES ARM 1, and that is a derived determination, not an assumption. SR14 says
      *> "at level 1" and the standard writes "level 1 or level 77" elsewhere when it means both, so
      *> the question is real. It is settled by two texts. 8.5.1.3.2: "Three types of entries exist
      *> for which there is no true concept of level", the second being entries that specify
      *> noncontiguous working-storage, local storage and linkage data items - a 77 entry is not AT a
      *> level greater than 1, it is outside the level system, so SR14's arm cannot exclude it by
      *> level arithmetic. And 13.11.1 declares the two spellings ALTERNATIVES for one thing: "Data
      *> elements that bear no hierarchical relationship to any other data item may be described as
      *> records that are single elementary items. Alternatively, such data elements ... may be
      *> described as separate data description entries having level-number 77." SR14's evident
      *> subject is SUBORDINATION to a non-strong group, and a 77 entry is defined by having no such
      *> relationship. The surveyed implementations agree - GnuCOBOL's testsuite uses `77 ptr USAGE
      *> POINTER.` throughout.
      *>
      *> ARM 2 - "an elementary data item subordinate to a type declaration that includes the STRONG
      *> phrase": SP inside STRONGT. The test is the DECLARATION-side TYPEDEF STRONG, so a pointer
      *> member of a STRONG template is admitted at the template and its TYPE clones inherit the
      *> verdict; the weak spelling is the negative fixture pb183-usage-pointer-in-weak-typedef.
