      *> ISO 8.3.3.6.3 SR1 - "A figurative constant may be used whenever 'literal'
      *> appears in a format or when a rule allows it", and 8.4.3.2.3 SR8 makes

      *> IT COMPILED CLEAN AND ABORTED AT RUN TIME (fix-queue PB25) with
      *> "intrinsic string argument 'BoundFigurative'". IntrinsicRenderer's
      *> string-argument visitor rendered EmitText.LoudValue for BoundFigurative
      *> and BoundAllLiteral - even though OperandText.AsString, which the visitor's
      *> own BoundFieldOperand arm already delegates to, had implemented the right
      *> answer all along and cited the rule in its comments. One rule written in
      *> two places, and the second copy was a loud stage.

      *> THE LENGTHS ARE 8.3.3.6.4 GR3's, the "length of the string is NOT specified
      *> in the rules for the context" case - which is exactly a bare function
      *> argument, since nothing there fixes a size:
      *>   (b) a figurative constant other than ALL literal-1 is ONE character;
      *>   (c) otherwise, the length of literal-1.
      *> That is why SPACE is one space and ALL "AB" is the two characters "AB",
      *> rather than either being padded to the receiving item.
      *>
      *> FUNCTION LENGTH HAD ITS OWN COPY OF THE MISTAKE, in the binder rather than
      *> the renderer: one match arm refused "a numeric/figurative literal" and its
      *> comment asserted the rejection was spec-correct. Half of it was. 15.50.3 r1
      *> admits "an alphanumeric, national, or boolean literal", which excludes a
      *> NUMERIC literal and says nothing about figurative constants - and
      *> 8.3.3.6.4 GR1 makes SPACE an ALPHANUMERIC character value here, exactly
      *> what r1 permits. One code standing for two rules enforced neither.
