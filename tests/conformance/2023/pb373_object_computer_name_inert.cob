      *> ISO §12.3.6.4 GR2 — computer-name-1 identifies NO equipment
      *> configuration (Annex A.1 item 127, optional): DOC-A.1-127.
      *>
      *> GR2: "Computer-name-1 may provide a means for identifying
      *> equipment configuration, in which case computer-name-1 and
      *> its implied configuration are specified by each implementor."
      *> A.1's preamble makes the item OPTIONAL ("The element may be
      *> provided at the implementor's option") and conditions the
      *> documentation duty on provision ("If the element is provided
      *> by the implementor, the implementor's user documentation
      *> shall document the element"); §4.2.5 is the conformance
      *> clause that governs the A.1 list.
      *>
      *> CONFORMANCE.md §7 DOC-A.1-127 makes TWO claims and this file
      *> asserts BOTH:
      *>   (1) there is ONE object computer whether the name is
      *>       present (GR2), absent (GR3), or the paragraph is
      *>       omitted (GR4)                    — PART 1 below
      *>   (2) "the clauses that follow it (PROGRAM COLLATING
      *>       SEQUENCE; CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION) behave identically
      *>       with or without a name"          — PART 2 below
      *>
      *> ================= PART 1 — one object computer ============
      *> THE CLAIM IS AN INVARIANCE, NOT "IT COMPILES".  So this
      *> measures the same equipment-configuration facts in FOUR
      *> source shapes of one compilation group and compares them:
      *>   L1OCW01  OBJECT-COMPUTER. WISE-OWL-9000.  a name (GR2)
      *>   L1OCW02  OBJECT-COMPUTER. ACME-4381.      a DIFFERENT name
      *>   L1OCW03  OBJECT-COMPUTER.                 no name (GR3)
      *>   L1OCW04  no OBJECT-COMPUTER paragraph     (GR4)
      *> §12.3.6.3 SR4 lets L1OCW03's second period go.  A name-keyed
      *> equipment configuration — exactly what GR2 permits an
      *> implementor to provide — is what would make L1OCW02 answer
      *> differently from L1OCW01.
      *> The four are SEPARATE outermost source units, so GR1's
      *> containment rule ("...and to any source unit contained
      *> within that source unit") carries no configuration between
      *> them: each leg answers on its own paragraph alone.
      *>
      *> The signature holds the facts an implied equipment
      *> configuration fixes: FUNCTION BYTE-LENGTH of a group holding
      *> BINARY-LONG and BINARY-DOUBLE (§13.18.60.4 GR21 — "The
      *> representation and length ... is implementor-defined"),
      *> FUNCTION ORD of a native character, a runtime relation under
      *> the native alphanumeric program collating sequence
      *> (§12.3.6.4 GR10) and a runtime class condition under the
      *> character classification in effect (§12.3.6.4 GR6).  No
      *> implementor-defined VALUE is pinned — only that all four
      *> legs agree.
      *>
      *> ============ PART 2 — the clauses AFTER the name ==========
      *> ⛔ PART 1 ALONE ASSERTS ONLY HALF THE DETERMINATION.  Legs
      *> 01–04 all run under the DEFAULT arms — GR10 (no PROGRAM
      *> COLLATING SEQUENCE clause) and GR6 (no CHARACTER
      *> CLASSIFICATION clause) — which are precisely the branches
      *> that apply BECAUSE no clause is written, so they say nothing
      *> about claim (2).  Two more pairs do:
      *>   L1OCW05  OBJECT-COMPUTER. WISE-OWL-9000
      *>                PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE IS REV.
      *>   L1OCW06  OBJECT-COMPUTER.
      *>                PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE IS REV.
      *>   L1OCW07  OBJECT-COMPUTER. WISE-OWL-9000
      *>                CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION IS TR.
      *>   L1OCW08  OBJECT-COMPUTER.
      *>                CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION IS TR.
      *> This is the shape that has actually broken once: kb/Work
      *> PB78 — `OBJECT-COMPUTER. PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE IS REV.`
      *> was "unexpected 'PROGRAM'" because the grammar hung the
      *> clause off a REQUIRED name.  A name-keyed configuration
      *> would bite here first.
      *>
      *> PCS legs — §12.3.6.4 GR9 ("When the PROGRAM COLLATING
      *> SEQUENCE clause is specified, the initial alphanumeric
      *> program collating sequence is the collating sequence
      *> associated with alphabet-name-1") and GR11 ("The
      *> alphanumeric program collating sequence and national program
      *> collating sequence are used to determine the truth value of
      *> any alphanumeric comparisons and national comparisons").
      *> ALPHABET REV IS "B" "A" puts "B" in position 1 and "A" in
      *> position 2, so `IF X > "B"` is TRUE for X = "A" under REV
      *> and FALSE under the native sequence — the same observable
      *> tests/conformance/2023/pb78_object_computer_optional_name
      *> already pins.  Both legs must answer REV; the ELSE branch
      *> prints NATIVE, and a CALL that never ran leaves the flag 0
      *> and also prints NATIVE, so the leg fails LOUDLY.
      *>
      *> CC legs — §12.3.6.4 GR5 a ("If locale-name-1 is specified,
      *> the initial alphanumeric character classification is the
      *> character classification associated with locale-name-1") and
      *> GR7 a ("the uppercase and lowercase mappings of characters
      *> for the UPPER-CASE and LOWER-CASE intrinsic functions").
      *> The two legs are compared to EACH OTHER, never to a pinned
      *> Turkish value: §8.2.1 makes locale availability a runtime
      *> property, so if "tr-TR" is absent both legs fall back
      *> identically and the invariance still holds.  That keeps the
      *> golden environment-independent while still measuring the
      *> clause rather than GR6's default.  CC-NONZERO guards the
      *> vacuous case in which neither CALL ran.
      *>
      *> CONTROL LEG: the driver also compares its signature with a
      *> deliberately perturbed copy, so a green run cannot be a
      *> comparison that never reports a difference.  SIG-NONZERO
      *> guards a signature that is vacuously equal because nothing
      *> was computed; ALPHA-LOWER is pinned by §8.8.4.4.4 GR3c2
      *> ("a" is a lowercase letter and no locale is in effect).
