      *> kb/Work PB203 - a USAGE BIT member of a REDEFINES class holds BIT positions of the shared area, not
      *> the characters of the byte that contains them. ISO 13.18.44.4 GR1 states the association in BITS:
      *> "Storage association for the subject of the entry starts at the first bit of the data item referenced
      *> by data-name-2 and continues over an area sufficient to contain the number of bits required by the
      *> data item referenced by the subject of the entry." 13.18.29.4 GR1 b) makes a bit group "an elementary
      *> data item of usage bit ... described with PICTURE 1(m), where m is the bit length of the group" and
      *> GR1 c) sends its members through 8.5.1.6.3, whose rule 1 puts two same-level bit items at successive
      *> BIT positions - so they SHARE a byte. 14.6.8.6's own NOTE settles it: "When an item is of usage bit,
      *> the item is not necessarily aligned on a byte boundary and the item need not occupy an integral
      *> number of bytes."
      *> BEFORE: the bit-group shapes failed BACKEND compilation (four CS0103 - a dead record-struct type was
      *> emitted for a group the physical model had collapsed into the class backing, and its AsBits() named
      *> the suppressed subordinates), while the elementary and sub-byte shapes compiled and answered the raw
      *> CHARACTER of the containing byte.
      *> ⛔ EVERY BIT LEG BELOW IS PAIRED WITH ITS NO-REDEFINES CONTROL. The claim is not "some bits come out"
      *> but "the redefines lane and the ordinary lane give the SAME answer", which is what one shared storage
      *> area means; a control that drifts is the failure this file exists to catch.
      *> Expected values are computed from the character repertoire: 'A'=x41=01000001, 'B'=x42=01000010,
      *> 'H'=x48=01001000, 'I'=x49=01001001, 'a'=x61=01100001, 'b'=x62=01100010, 'c'=x63=01100011,
      *> 'X'=x58=01011000, 'Y'=x59=01011001 - high-order bit first (8.5.1.6.3's "first bit position").
      *> EDITIONS - MEASURED, not assumed. GROUP-USAGE and boolean data are both COBOL-2002 introductions
      *> (constructs.json group-usage-2002 / boolean-data-2002), and this file's output is BYTE-IDENTICAL at
      *> --std 2002, 2014 and 2023; at --std 85 every leg is refused COBOLNET0900 ("GROUP-USAGE clause requires
      *> COBOL-2002" / "boolean data (PICTURE symbol 1 / USAGE BIT) requires COBOL-2002") plus COBOLNET1502 for
      *> FUNCTION BYTE-LENGTH. The fix changes storage association, never the edition gate, so the corpus keeps
      *> ONE copy - a byte-identical 2002/2014 duplicate would test the gate a third time and nothing else.
