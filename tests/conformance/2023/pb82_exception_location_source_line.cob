      * PB82 - FUNCTION EXCEPTION-LOCATION's third part (15.30.3 r2b3,
      * "an implementor-defined identifier of the source line that
      * contains the beginning of the statement") is the line of the
      * statement's first token in the file that PHYSICALLY holds it
      * (docs/CONFORMANCE.md determination), not the ordinal of the
      * resultant text after COPY / REPLACE / continuation processing: a
      * bare number for the main source file, "copybook(line)" for a
      * statement inside COPY-incorporated text. This program shifts the
      * resultant text three ways before each RAISE - a 3-line data COPY
      * (line 25), a REPLACE statement (line 32, which vanishes from the
      * resultant text) and a fixed-form continuation (lines 37-38,
      * which JOIN) - and every reported line is still a line of THIS
      * file: 35, 40, and the procedure copybook's own line 2 for the
      * copied RAISE. Fixed-form: every line stays within column 72.
