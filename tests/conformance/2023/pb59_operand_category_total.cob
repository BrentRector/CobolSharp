      *> The OperandCategory TOTALIZATION (PB59 family 7b) - the one 8.5.2.1 classifier answers every
      *> statically categorized shape, and the MAX/MIN TYPE resolution and BODY choice read the same answer:
      *> MR: a ref-mod slice of a NUMERIC display item is class-and-category ALPHANUMERIC (8.4.3.3.4 GR6c),
      *>     so MAX(N9(1:1) "A") is a UNIFORM alphanumeric list (15.59.3 r2) compared by the 8.8.4.2.7
      *>     relation - "A" (ordinal 66) exceeds "0" (49). Before the fix the skipped GR6c rewrite sent the
      *>     call down the numeric row and it ANSWERED 0 - a silent wrong answer on legal source.
      *> MG: a group is class and category alphanumeric (8.5.2.1; per 8.5.2.10 item 3 only GROUP-USAGE
      *>     NATIONAL makes a national group, which is staged) - MAX over two groups compares their character
      *>     images and returns the greater image. Before the fix the type resolution saw NO category (the
      *>     null group arm) while the body chose the string comparison, and the halves disagreeing CRASHED
      *>     at run time ("FUNCTION MAX (no numeric render recipe)").
      *> NG: NATIONAL-OF(group) is CONFORMING - 15.66.3 r1 admits class alphabetic or alphanumeric, and a
      *>     group IS class alphanumeric - so the now-live class screen must keep admitting it (the PB1
      *>     failure mode guarded against: a new screen must not reject legal source).
      *> SP: DISPLAY-OF(SPACE) is conforming (8.3.3.6.3 SR1 admits a figurative where a rule allows a
      *>     literal; SPACE reads national in the national-argument context, GR5) and converts to the one
      *>     alphanumeric space - ORD = 33. Figuratives stay category-NEUTRAL at bind (8.3.3.6.4 GR1/GR4),
      *>     the PB25 render channel carries them.
