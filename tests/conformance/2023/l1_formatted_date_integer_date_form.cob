      *> ISO §15.39.3 r3 — "Argument-2 shall be a value in integer date form": the FULL interval, both ends and
      *> both directions of the violation, for FORMATTED-DATE.
      *>
      *> §15.5.2 is what "integer date form" MEANS, and it states an interval, not a ceiling: "A value in integer
      *> date form is a positive integer that represents a number of days succeeding December 31, 1600, in the
      *> Gregorian calendar. It shall be greater than zero and shall be less than or equal to the value of
      *> FUNCTION INTEGER-OF-DATE (99991231), which is 3,067,671." The same clause fixes the epoch — "a starting
      *> date of Monday, January 1, 1601 … integer date 1 was a Monday" — so integer date 1 IS 1601-01-01 and
      *> 3,067,671 IS 9999-12-31, which §15.3.1.2's basic calendar date format renders as 16010101 and 99991231
      *> (§15.39.4 r1: "a representation of the date contained in argument-2 according to the format in
      *> argument-1").
      *>
      *> Outside that interval the argument is an incorrect value for the argument, so ISO §15.3 applies: "If the
      *> evaluation of an argument results in an incorrect value for that argument … the EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION
      *> exception condition is set to exist." With checking enabled the declarative fires and RESUME AT NEXT
      *> STATEMENT leaves the receiver untouched, so CAUGHT is the assertion and step 7 proves the receiver was
      *> never written by any of the four raising calls. §15.3's OTHER arm — "if … checking … is not enabled, the
      *> implementor defines the result of the function reference" — is why the exception, and not a default
      *> value, is what this file asserts: a default result is implementor-defined and cannot be derived here.
      *>
      *> THE IN-RANGE ENDPOINTS ARE NOT DECORATION. A guard that raised on everything would satisfy steps 3-6 and
      *> be wrong; steps 1 and 2 are what make the interval an interval.
      *>
      *> STEP 6 IS THE NARROWING ARM, and it is the site this inventory row names (IntrinsicRenderer#AsInt):
      *> 184,467,440,737,096,955 × 100 + 67 = 18,446,744,073,709,695,567 = 2^64 + 143,951. A cast that wrapped
      *> modulo 2^64 would hand the function 143,951 — a perfectly plausible integer date (1995-02-15) — and print
      *> 19950215 from an argument nineteen orders of magnitude away, with the §15.5.2 guard never reached. A value
      *> the receiving body cannot represent is an incorrect argument under §15.3, so it raises there instead.
