      *> SMALLEST-ALGEBRAIC function a COBOL-2023 one, so the two can only be compared at 2023. The other two
      *> equivalences (FARTHEST-FROM-ZERO against HIGHEST-ALGEBRAIC, and with SIGN NEGATIVE against
      *> LOWEST-ALGEBRAIC) are asserted at the introducing edition in 2014/pb452_set_content_numeric.
