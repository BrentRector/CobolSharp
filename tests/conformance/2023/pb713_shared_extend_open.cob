       PROGRAM-ID. PB713EXT.
      *> kb/Work PB713 — a sharing-active OPEN EXTEND must complete with
      *> an I-O status, on EVERY organization and EVERY on-disk framing.
      *>
      *> 14.9.27.4 GR1: "The execution of the OPEN statement causes the
      *> value of the I-O status associated with file-name-1 to be updated
      *> to one of the values in 9.1.13, I-O status", and GR25: "If the
      *> execution of the OPEN statement is unsuccessful, the file is not
      *> affected". A status is the ONLY outcome the standard offers; the
      *> residual host failure has its own value, 9.1.13.6 1) '30'. Until
      *> this program's fix the runtime measured the EXTEND write-ordinal
      *> base from a SECOND handle on the path it had just opened for
      *> WRITE, and the host's refusal of that handle escaped the run unit
      *> as an unhandled exception — no status, no USE declarative, no
      *> diagnostic. Line sequential and RECORD VARYING died; fixed-width
      *> record sequential measured a file LENGTH, took no handle, and
      *> passed. One dispatch, three arms, one arm tested.
      *>
      *> 9.1.15 3) is what makes the shape legal in the first place: "The
      *> sharing with all other mode allows concurrent access to a
      *> physical file through other file connectors specifying input,
      *> I-O, or extend mode". 14.9.27.3 SR8 is why the corpus
      *> under-covers it — the ALL spelling forces a companion clause:
      *> "if the sharing phrase is omitted from the OPEN statement and the
      *> ALL phrase is specified in the SHARING clause of the file control
      *> entry for file-name-1 or if the ALL phrase is specified on the
      *> OPEN statement, the LOCK MODE clause shall be specified in the
      *> file control entry for file-name-1". FN and FP below carry the
      *> two spellings SR8 does NOT constrain, and FK the LOCK-MODE-only
      *> one whose sharing mode is 9.1.15's undetermined implementor
      *> default.
      *>
      *> WHAT THE APPEND HAS TO DO. 14.9.27.4 GR15: "When the EXTEND
      *> phrase is specified, the OPEN statement positions the file
      *> immediately after the last logical record for that file."
      *> 14.9.51.4 GR18: "If there are records in the physical file, the
      *> first record written after the execution of the OPEN statement
      *> with the EXTEND phrase is the successor of the last record in the
      *> physical file", and GR19 fixes the measurement POINT for the
      *> shared case: "the added records follow the records present in the
      *> physical file when it was opened". So every read-back below is
      *> AAAA then BBBB, in that order, and never one record alone.
      *>
      *> Two organization-specific consequences of the same positioning:
      *> 14.9.51.4 GR29 a) — under extend "the first record released after
      *> the OPEN is assigned a record number that is one greater than the
      *> highest relative record number existing in the physical file",
      *> moved into the RELATIVE KEY item, so R-K reads 0002 over a file
      *> holding RRN 1. 14.9.51.4 GR38 — the indexed extend's first
      *> released record "shall have a prime record key whose value is
      *> greater than the highest prime record key value existing in the
      *> physical file when it was opened", so K006 follows K002.
      *>
      *> EDITION. The matrix spans two floors. ORGANIZATION IS LINE
      *> SEQUENTIAL is COBOL-2023 (12.4.5.10.3 GR2, kb/Work PB688), while
      *> the SHARING and LOCK MODE clauses and the OPEN SHARING phrase are
      *> COBOL-2002 - so the LINE SEQUENTIAL half of this program is legal
      *> only here, and its record-sequential, relative and indexed half is
      *> proved at the 2002 floor by the sibling 2002/pb713_shared_extend
      *> _open (PB713E02), which is that subset and nothing else. None of
      *> the rules cited above is edition-differentiated and the runtime
      *> path carries no --std axis, so 2014 executes the identical code;
      *> the acceptance axis is the VersionConformancePass gate on
      *> FileOrganizationLineSequential2023 / FileSharingClause2002 /
      *> LockModeClause2002, checked by the version matrix.
      *> SharedExtendOpenDriftTests holds the whole (organization x framing
      *> x spelling) matrix at the runtime level, where there is no edition.
