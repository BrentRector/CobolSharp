      *> ISO §14.9.41.4 GR11 and GR12 (RELATIVE FILES).
      *> GR11 — "If FIRST is specified, the file position indicator is
      *> set to the relative record number of the first existing
      *> logical record in the file. If no records exist in the file,
      *> the invalid key condition exists and the execution of the
      *> START statement is unsuccessful."
      *> GR12 — the same for LAST and "the last existing logical
      *> record".
      *> The word the goldens have to bite on is EXISTING. FR is
      *> SPARSE: its records are at relative record numbers 3, 7 and 9,
      *> so "first existing" is 3 (not 1, the lowest number the file
      *> could hold) and "last existing" is 9 (not 3, the count).
      *>   FK  START FIRST, then READ NEXT. §14.9.30.4 GR21b makes the
      *>       record the START selected available and GR25 moves its
      *>       relative record number into the RELATIVE KEY item, so
      *>       the indicator's value prints outright: 0003, with R003.
      *>       RK is deliberately set to 5 beforehand — FIRST takes no
      *>       operand, and a phrase that (wrongly) consulted RK could
      *>       not answer 3.
      *>   LK  START LAST, then READ NEXT: 0009 with R009. RK holds
      *>       0003 at that point, so again the answer cannot have come
      *>       from the key item.
      *>   EF/EL  A relative file with no records at all. Both phrases
      *>       take the INVALID KEY imperative and set '23': §9.1.13.5
      *>       lists the invalid-key values, and '21', '22' and '24'
      *>       are all WRITE or REWRITE conditions, so '23' is the only
      *>       one a START can produce — the value the standard states
      *>       outright in the indexed and sequential twins of these
      *>       rules (GR18, GR19, GR20, GR21).
