      *> kb/Work PB488 - THE OVER-REJECTION GUARD for the ISO 13.16.3 SR24 condition-name association screen.
      *> SR24 is an EXCLUSION list, so the hazard a screen for it creates is refusing legal COBOL, not
      *> admitting illegal COBOL. Every leg below is a shape SR24 does NOT exclude, chosen because the
      *> neighbouring letter would catch it if the predicate were written one word wider.
      *>
      *> 1) CONSECUTIVE 88s. SR24 a) excludes "another level 88 entry" from BEING a conditional variable,
      *>    which is precisely what makes a RUN of condition-names share one: the rule's own second sentence
      *>    is plural - "The condition-name entries for a particular conditional variable shall immediately
      *>    follow the entry describing the item". P-AB, P-CD and P-AB-OR-CD all associate with P.
      *>    P = "AB", so P-AB is true, P-CD is false, and P-AB-OR-CD (13.18.63.2 format 3's literal list) is
      *>    true on its first literal.
      *> 2) AN ALPHANUMERIC GROUP WHOSE MEMBERS ARE ALL USAGE DISPLAY. SR24 c) excludes only a group
      *>    "containing items with a usage other than display". 8.8.4.2.1 treats AG as an elementary
      *>    alphanumeric item, whose value is its members' concatenation "ABCD", so AG-COND is true.
      *> 3) AN 88 AFTER A LEVEL-66 ALIAS ELSEWHERE IN THE SECTION. SR24 b) excludes the alias itself; it says
      *>    nothing about later entries. Q follows R1 in source but is an ordinary entry, so Q-AB is a normal
      *>    association and is true.
      *> 4) AN ELEMENTARY MEMBER OF A STRONG TYPE DECLARATION. SR24 g)'s second arm excludes "a GROUP item
      *>    subordinate to such a type declaration" - an elementary member is not one. F1 of the TYPE
      *>    reference V is moved "AB", so F1-AB is true.
      *> 5) A GROUP CONTAINING AN OCCURS DEPENDING ON TABLE. SR24 h) excludes "a variable-length group", and
      *>    8.5.1.12.1 defines that as "a group item whose data description has at least one dynamic-length
      *>    elementary item or dynamic-capacity table as a subordinate item". An occurs-depending-on group is
      *>    a DIFFERENT shape - the standard lists the two separately (13.18.12.3 SR2 names "an
      *>    occurs-depending-on group item, a variable-length group, or a dynamic-length elementary item") -
      *>    so ODO-COND is legal. Its literal "ZZZZZ" differs from the group's image in the first character
      *>    position under any extent (8.8.4.2.7 compares left to right), so the answer is N without
      *>    depending on how the ODO extent is measured.
      *> 6) A GROUP CONTAINING A FIXED OCCURS TABLE OF DISPLAY ITEMS. Same c) reasoning as leg 2; the image
      *>    after the two MOVEs is "AABB", so TG-COND is true.
      *> 7) A NATIONAL GROUP. SR24 c) is confined to an ALPHANUMERIC group; 13.18.29.4 GR2 makes NG "an
      *>    elementary item of usage national described with PICTURE N(m)", i.e. not an alphanumeric group at
      *>    all, so its members' usage national does not exclude it. Its as-if image is N"AB", so NG-COND is
      *>    true.
