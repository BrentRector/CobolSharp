      *> PB73 - two Table-16 (ISO 14.9.25.3 SR10) derivations, adjudicated 2026-08-18.
      *>
      *> (1) A function's 15.2 TYPE decides its Table-16 row as a MOVE sender. An INTEGER function ("an operational
      *>     sign and no digits to the right of the decimal point", 15.2 item 5) is the Integer row - alphanumeric and
      *>     national receivers are legal (the item-92 text form: the significant digits, no padding). A NUMERIC
      *>     function (item 4 - "an operational sign", nothing said about the decimal point) is the Noninteger row:
      *>     legal only into a numeric or numeric-edited receiver - 8.4.3.2.3 SR11 states the same principle for the
      *>     integer-operand positions ("a numeric function shall not be specified where an integer operand is
      *>     required, even though a particular reference of the numeric function might yield an integer value").
      *>     The negatives pb73-move-numeric-function-to-* pin the refusal; --permissive keeps the former admission
      *>     as its literal text, with a warning.
      *> (2) 8.4.3.3.4 GR2 ("operated upon for purposes of reference modification as if it were redefined as a
      *>     data item of class and category alphanumeric") governs the OPERATION - the positions - and GR6 the
      *>     RESULT: "the same class, category, and usage as that defined for identifier-1" except an EXHAUSTIVE
      *>     list (edited -> un-edited, numeric -> alphanumeric/national) that names neither boolean nor
      *>     alphabetic. So a DISPLAY-FORM boolean's slice is BOOLEAN (GR1 gives a boolean item boolean positions
      *>     in either form; GR5a makes them character positions unless the usage is bit) exactly as a BIT-form
      *>     one's is: it moves to boolean and alphanumeric receivers, is a class-boolean argument, and is refused
      *>     into PIC 9 (the negatives pb73-move-display-boolean-view-to-numeric / -bit-boolean-view-to-numeric).
      *>     The same reading keeps an ALPHABETIC slice alphabetic - PB72's 2026-08-09 erasure is reversed
      *>     (negatives pb73-move-alphabetic-view-to-boolean / -to-numeric).
