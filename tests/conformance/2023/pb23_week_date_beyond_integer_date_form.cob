      *>   integer date form equivalent", and past 15.5.2's ceiling there is none,
      *>   so rule 14's "incorrect value ... FOR THE RETURNED VALUE" arm applies.
      *> - TEST-FORMATTED-DATETIME must return ZERO. 15.92.1 tests validity
      *>   "according to the specified format"; 15.92.4 requires any non-zero answer
      *>   to be "the ordinal character position at which the first error ... was
      *>   detected" - and no CHARACTER here is in error. The identical '6' in
      *>   "2009W526" is valid, so there is no position to report.
      *> - SECONDS-FROM-FORMATTED-TIME must return its seconds: 15.79.4 reads the
      *>   TIME subfields, which do not depend on the date.
