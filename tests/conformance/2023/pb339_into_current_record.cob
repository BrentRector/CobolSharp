      *> kb/Work PB339 — the sending operand of a READ … INTO / RETURN … INTO
      *> implicit MOVE is THE CURRENT RECORD, not the padded record area.
      *> The 2023 leg.
      *>
      *> ISO §14.9.30.4 GR4 b) (and its RETURN twin §14.9.34.4 GR5 b), word
      *> for word bar one preposition): "The current record is moved from the
      *> record area to the area specified by identifier-1 according to the
      *> rules for the MOVE statement without the CORRESPONDING phrase.  The
      *> size of the current record is determined by rules specified in the
      *> RECORD clause.  If the file description entry contains a RECORD IS
      *> VARYING clause, the implied move is an alphanumeric group move."
      *>
      *> §13.18.43.4 GR16 supplies that size for a FORMAT 2 RECORD clause:
      *> "If the INTO phrase is specified in the READ or RETURN statement,
      *> the number of bytes in the current record that participate as the
      *> sending operands in the implicit MOVE statement is determined by the
      *> following conditions:  a) If data-name-1 is specified, by the content
      *> of the data item referenced by data-name-1.  b) If data-name-1 is not
      *> specified, by the value that would have been moved into the data item
      *> referenced by data-name-1 had data-name-1 been specified."
      *> GR15 has just put the just-read length there, so both arms name the
      *> record's own byte count — never the area's width.
      *>
      *> A LEFT-justified receiver cannot tell the two apart (both space-fill
      *> on the right).  The discriminators below are the JUSTIFIED clause,
      *> whose truncation takes the LEFTMOST characters, and the group-move
      *> designation, which forbids editing.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, each derived before it was run:
      *>  A  F holds the 5-byte record "ABCDE" (WS-LEN = 5 at the WRITE, so
      *>     §13.18.43.4 GR13 a) wrote five bytes).  GR15 restores WS-LEN = 5,
      *>     GR16 a) makes the sender those five bytes.  Receiver X(10)
      *>     JUSTIFIED: §13.18.32.4 GR2 — "the data is aligned at the rightmost
      *>     character position … with … space fill for the leftmost character
      *>     positions" => "     ABCDE".  Sending the 20-byte area instead
      *>     yields ten spaces (that is the defect).
      *>  B  Receiver X(3) JUSTIFIED, sender five bytes: §13.18.32.4 GR1 —
      *>     "the leftmost character positions … of the sending operand shall
      *>     be truncated" => "CDE".  From the padded area it would be three
      *>     spaces.
      *>  C  Receiver X(10) plain: §14.6.8.5 left-aligned, right space fill =>
      *>     "ABCDE     ".  The control leg: identical either way.
      *>  D  Receiver PIC XXBXXBXX (eight character positions).  GR4 b) makes
      *>     the move an alphanumeric GROUP move, and §14.9.25.4 GR4 treats a
      *>     group move "exactly as if it were an alphanumeric to alphanumeric
      *>     elementary move, except that there is no conversion of data from
      *>     one form of internal representation to another", the receiving
      *>     area "filled without consideration for the individual elementary
      *>     or group items" — so NO editing: "ABCDE   ".  Editing the sender
      *>     would give "AB CD E " (or, from the padded area, "AB CD E ").
      *>  E  Receiver X(3) plain: §14.6.8.5 right truncation => "ABC".
      *>  F  GR16 b), the arm with no DEPENDING ON phrase: G has two record
      *>     descriptions and WRITE G-SHORT wrote its own five bytes
      *>     (§13.18.43.4 GR13 b).  The sender is still five bytes, so the
      *>     X(10) JUSTIFIED receiver gets "     ABCDE".
      *>  G  RETURN … INTO, §14.9.34.4 GR5 b) + §13.18.43.4 GR16 a): the SD
      *>     released eight bytes "K01PQRST"; receiver X(12) JUSTIFIED =>
      *>     "    K01PQRST".
