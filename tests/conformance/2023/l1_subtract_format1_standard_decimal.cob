      *> ISO §14.9.44.4 GR1, SECOND PARAGRAPH — the half of the format
      *> 1 rule that only exists under standard arithmetic: "When
      *> standard-decimal arithmetic, or standard-binary arithmetic is
      *> in effect, the result of the initial evaluation is equivalent
      *> to the result of the arithmetic expression
      *> (operand-11 + operand-12 + … + operand-1n) … The result of
      *> the subtraction from the value of each data item referenced
      *> by identifier-2 is equivalent to the result of the arithmetic
      *> expression (identifier-2 - initial-evaluation)".
      *> ARITHMETIC IS STANDARD-DECIMAL puts that mode in effect
      *> (§8.8.1.5.1); the NATIVE half of the same rule is pinned by
      *> 2023/l1_subtract_format1_initial_evaluation, whose four lines
      *> these four mirror statement for statement.  The two modes
      *> must agree here, and that agreement is the point: the rule
      *> defines the standard-arithmetic result AS an expression, so
      *> the mode may change how the intermediate is carried but not
      *> what value reaches the receivers.
      *> STANDARD-BINARY, the rule's other named mode, is a declared
