      *> ISO §14.9.37.4 GR7 — "If both conditions specified in General
      *> rule 5 are satisfied and there is more than one setting of the
      *> search index for which all conditions in the WHEN phrase are
      *> satisfied, the search operation is successful. The final
      *> setting of the search index is equal to one of them, but it is
      *> undefined which one."
      *> GR5 a) holds: the contents of WS-K are 01, 03, 03, 03, 09,
      *> which is the ascending order the ASCENDING phrase declares
      *> (§13.18.38.4 GR3). Duplicates have to be compatible with GR5a,
      *> because GR7's own premise — more than one satisfying setting
      *> WHILE GR5 is satisfied — can arise no other way. GR5 b) holds
      *> vacuously: WS-KE is not subordinate to any OCCURS clause.
      *> Three settings (2, 3 and 4) satisfy WHEN WS-K = 03, so GR7 is
      *> the governing rule. Only what GR7 fixes is asserted:
      *>   G7=FOUND      the search IS successful (GR1a, not AT END);
      *>   G7-KEY-OK     the final setting satisfies the WHEN phrase;
      *>   G7-IX-IN-SET  it is one of the settings that do (2..4).
      *> WHICH of the three is undefined and is never printed.
