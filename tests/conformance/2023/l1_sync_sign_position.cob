      *> ISO §13.18.55.4 GR7 — with ANY form of the SYNCHRONIZED clause, the
      *> operational sign still appears in the position the SIGN clause
      *> specifies, explicitly or implicitly.
      *>
      *> THE RULE. §13.18.55.4 GR7: "If the data description of an item
      *> contains an operational sign and any form of the SYNCHRONIZED clause,
      *> the sign of the item appears in the sign position explicitly or
      *> implicitly specified by the SIGN clause."
      *> "Any form" is GR3/GR4/GR5's three: bare SYNCHRONIZED, SYNCHRONIZED
      *> LEFT, SYNCHRONIZED RIGHT — all three name a natural boundary, and
      *> GR7 says none of them may move the sign off the position §13.18.52
      *> put it on.
      *>
      *> THE EXPLICIT HALF, DERIVED FROM §13.18.52.4 GR6 ALONE.
      *>   GR6 a) "The operational sign is presumed to be the leading (or,
      *>          respectively, trailing) character position of the data item
      *>          to which it applies; this character position is not a digit
      *>          position."
      *>   GR6 b) "The operational signs for positive and negative are the
      *>          basic special characters '+' and '-', respectively." (The
      *>          printed standard sets that second character as an en dash;
      *>          the basic special character it names is Table 1's "minus
      *>          sign (hyphen)", §8.1.3.1 — U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS.)
      *> So PIC S9(4) SIGN IS ... SEPARATE is 5 character positions, at one
      *> byte each (docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-209), and VALUE -42 gives the
      *> digit string "0042":
      *>   P1V  LEADING SEPARATE  SYNC        -42 -> [-0042]
      *>   P2V  TRAILING SEPARATE SYNC        -42 -> [0042-]
      *>   P3V  LEADING SEPARATE  SYNC LEFT   +42 -> [+0042]
      *>   P4V  TRAILING SEPARATE SYNC RIGHT  +42 -> [0042+]
      *> Nothing here depends on an implementor determination: the SEPARATE
      *> form's position AND representation are both spec-defined.
      *> CTRL is the same description as P1V without the clause; GR7 makes the
      *> two images identical, so a SYNCHRONIZED form that shifted the sign
      *> would break CTRL even if it kept a self-consistent layout.
      *>
      *> THE IMPLICIT HALF — WHICH IS NOT THE NO-SIGN-CLAUSE CASE.
      *> §13.18.52.4 GR4 removes that case from this rule's reach entirely:
      *> "A numeric item whose picture character-string contains the symbol
      *> 'S', and to which no SIGN clause applies ... The implementor shall
      *> specify the position and representation of the operational sign.
      *> General rules 5 and 6 do not apply to such signed numeric items."
      *> With no SIGN clause applying there is no "sign position ... specified
      *> by the SIGN clause" for GR7's consequent to name, so a bare
      *> PIC S9(4) SYNC with no SIGN clause anywhere would not exercise GR7 at
      *> all. The position a SIGN clause specifies IMPLICITLY is the one it
      *> applies by INHERITANCE from a containing group — §13.18.52.4 GR1,
      *> "or for each numeric item subordinate to the group to which it
      *> applies" — and, secondarily, the position a written clause fixes
      *> WITHOUT the SEPARATE CHARACTER phrase (GR5 a) rather than with it.
      *> This golden takes both arms:
      *>   IMPL / IMPLEQ — I1V carries no SIGN clause of its own; the clause
      *>     sits on the containing group `01 I1 SIGN IS TRAILING SEPARATE`
      *>     (legal by §13.18.52.3 SR1's third bullet, "an alphanumeric group
      *>     item"), and GR1 applies it to I1V. That inherited position is
      *>     fully spec-defined by GR6 a/b, so the image is printed
      *>     character-exact — [0042-] — and IMPLEQ pairs it against the
      *>     identical group I2 whose item carries no SYNC, which GR7
      *>     requires to agree.
      *>   EMBED — the written-but-not-SEPARATE arm: J1V PIC S9(4) SIGN IS
      *>     TRAILING SYNC against the identical J2V without SYNC. GR5 a)
      *>     fixes the POSITION ("associated with the leading (or,
      *>     respectively, trailing) digit position"), so the sign occupies an
      *>     EXISTING digit position and J1V is 4 bytes; but GR5 b) leaves
      *>     "what constitutes valid signs" to the implementor and
      *>     docs/CONFORMANCE.md has no DOC-A.1-178 row, so this arm asserts
      *>     only the EQUALITY GR7 actually claims and never prints either
      *>     image.
      *> IMPLEN pins the width the inherited arm rests on: I1V is 5 character
      *> positions by GR6 a) (the separate sign position "is not a digit
      *> position") at one byte each (DOC-A.1-209), so 01 I1 is 1 + 5 = 6 both
      *> with the SYNC clause and without it.
      *>
      *> Every image is read through a GROUP move to an alphanumeric item,
      *> which §14.9.25.4 GR4 makes a byte transfer rather than a numeric
      *> conversion; the one-byte prefix in each group is what gives a
      *> boundary adjustment something to do, and the printed slice skips it.
      *> The prefixes of the compared groups carry a VALUE so that no
      *> undefined byte ever enters an equality.
