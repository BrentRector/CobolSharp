      *> equivalent."  Every EVALUATE below is written TWICE, differing
      *> only in that one spelling of the range-expression word, so any
      *> difference between the two columns of a line is a violation.
      *> Range determination is NOT §14.9.13.4's own: GR2 routes it to
      *> §14.7.8, THROUGH phrase.  §14.7.8 1) fixes the NUMERIC range —
      *> both endpoints and all algebraic values between — so 2 THRU 4
      *> hits N=2,3,4 only, and THAT is a spec obligation.  §14.7.8 2)
      *> does not fix the alphanumeric one: with no IN alphabet-name
      *> phrase "the collating sequence is defined by the implementor".
      *> So "B" THRU "D" with W-A="C" is IMPLEMENTOR-DEFINED; this
      *> implementation collates the native UTF-16 repertoire, in which
      *> B < C < D, so it answers HIT — this implementation's
      *> documented latitude, not a spec obligation.  What SR1 mandates
      *> about that line is only that the THRU and THROUGH columns
      *> AGREE.
      *> The NOT line rests on §14.9.13.4 GR4 a) 5. instead, whose NOT
      *> form is the explicit conditional  subject < left-part OR
      *> subject > right-part  (and its operands are numeric anyway).
