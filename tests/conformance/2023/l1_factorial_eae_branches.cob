      *>     reference is conforming source and r1's arms are what decide the value.

      *> ⛔ WHY STANDARD-DECIMAL. §15.4.1 r1's "shall EQUAL" is scoped "When standard-decimal
      *> arithmetic or standard-binary arithmetic is in effect and an equivalent arithmetic
      *> expression is specified"; under NATIVE the same subclause gives only "an
      *> implementor-defined approximation of the value of that expression". Under ARITHMETIC IS
      *> STANDARD-DECIMAL every digit below is therefore REQUIRED BY THE STANDARD rather than
      *> merely produced by this implementation. The native lane of the same three arms is
      *> 85/l1_factorial_eae_native, written relationally for exactly that reason.
      *>
      *> ⛔ THE ARMS THE CORPUS DID NOT HAVE. r1a names TWO values and every existing golden used
      *> only the first - 2023/pb48_figurative_zero_intrinsic_argument (FACTORIAL(ZERO) = 1) and
      *> 2014/pb125_factorial_standard_decimal (FACTORIAL(0) = 1). FACTORIAL(1), and the whole of
      *> r1b - the value 2, which the standard breaks out into a lettered arm of its own - had
      *> never been written down anywhere in the corpus. r1c was covered (2023/pb40 3! = 6,
      *> 2023/pb21 5! = 120, 2002/pb125 33!/31! = 1056, 2014/pb125 34!/33! = 34) and is
      *> re-asserted here so all three arms are read off ONE output.
      *>
      *> The values, hand-multiplied from r1 itself:
      *>   0!  = 1                      (r1a, first value)
      *>   1!  = 1                      (r1a, second value)
      *>   2!  = 2                      (r1b)
      *>   5!  = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120        (r1c)
      *>   20! = 2432902008176640000    (r1c; 19 digits, exact inside the 34-digit SDIDI)
      *>   3!/2! = 6/2 = 3              (r1c over r1b - the arms meeting)
