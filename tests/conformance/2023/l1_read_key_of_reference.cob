      *> ISO §14.9.30.4 GR30 and GR31 — which key becomes the key of
      *> reference on a Format-2 (random) READ of an indexed file, and
      *> how long it lasts.
      *> GR30 "if the KEY phrase is specified, data-name-1 or
      *>   record-key-name-1 is established as the key of reference for
      *>   this retrieval.  If the dynamic access mode is specified,
      *>   this key of reference is also used for retrievals by any
      *>   subsequent executions of sequential format READ statements
      *>   ... until a different key of reference is established."
      *> GR31 is the same sentence for an ABSENT KEY phrase, with "the
      *>   prime record key" established instead.
      *> The key of reference is not directly displayable, so it is
      *> measured by the record the FOLLOWING sequential READ selects
      *> (§14.9.30 GR21 rule e reads it through the file position
      *> indicator).  The file is built so the two orders are exact
      *> opposites — prime 01 02 03 04 against alternate AA(04) BB(03)
      *> CC(02) DD(01) — and each leg's second line is the answer only
      *> one of them can give.
      *>
      *> LEG A (GR30, KEY IS written).  A1 fetches 02 by its ALTERNATE
      *> key "CC".  A2 is the sequential read that follows: in
      *> alternate-key order the record after CC is DD, i.e. 01.  A
      *> prime key of reference would have given 03.  A3 confirms DD is
      *> the last record under that key of reference (at end '10').
      *> LEG B (GR31, no KEY phrase).  B1 re-establishes the ALTERNATE
      *> as the key of reference, so B2's bare random READ is the one
      *> under test: GR31 makes the PRIME key the key of reference for
      *> that retrieval and for the reads after it.  B3 must therefore
      *> walk in PRIME order and give 02.  Had B2 left the alternate
      *> standing, B3 would be the at end '10' (nothing follows DD).
