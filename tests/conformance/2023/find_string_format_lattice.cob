      *> ISO §15.37.2 general format — the COMPLETE lattice of the format's three optional elements.
      *> The format is: FUNCTION FIND-STRING argument-1 argument-2 [LAST] [[START AFTER] argument-3]
      *> [ANYCASE], so a written call is one of 12 shapes: [LAST] present or absent × argument-3 absent,
      *> written BARE, or introduced by START AFTER (the inner bracket) × [ANYCASE] present or absent.
      *> Every shape is written here once, with the value §15.37.4 requires for it.
      *>
      *> H = "XYxyXYxyXYxy" (12 characters), N = "xy".
      *>   Without ANYCASE the comparison is on the operands as written: H(i:2) equals "xy" only at
      *>   i = 3, 7, 11 — the three lowercase runs. Occurrences: {3, 7, 11}.
      *>   With ANYCASE (§15.37.4 r4) the matching rules are as if every uppercase letter in BOTH
      *>   operands were replaced by its lowercase letter, i.e. as if H were "xyxyxyxyxyxy" and N "xy":
      *>   H(i:2) equals "xy" at i = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Occurrences: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11}.
      *> §15.37.4 r1 returns the FIRST occurrence, or the LAST when LAST is written; r2 makes
      *> argument-3 the number of matches to ignore before that determination is made, so argument-3 = 1
      *> drops the leading occurrence in the default direction and the trailing one under LAST.
      *> The [START AFTER] words are an optional introducer of the SAME argument-3, so S03/S05, S04/S06,
      *> S09/S11 and S10/S12 are each one meaning written two ways and must agree.
      *>
      *> ⛔ NOTHING HERE PINS WHAT AN "OCCURRENCE" IS WHEN MATCHES OVERLAP, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
      *> Both needles above were chosen so that adjacent matches are exactly len(argument-2) apart, so
      *> every value below is the same under an overlapping-inclusive and a non-overlapping reading of
      *> §15.37.4 r1/r2. §15.37 states NO consumption or resumption rule in either direction — unlike
      *> §15.87.4 r3 (SUBSTITUTE), which spells non-overlapping resumption outright — so the axis is
      *> UNDER-DETERMINED by the standard and is an owner/adjudicator call, not something a golden may
      *> settle by transcribing what the implementation happens to do. A draft of this file carried
      *> FIND-STRING("AAAAA" "AA" LAST) and FIND-STRING("AAAAA" "AA" 1); both were removed because
      *> their values (4 and 2) follow only from the overlapping reading. Re-add them here, one line
      *> each, in the change set that records the adjudication.
