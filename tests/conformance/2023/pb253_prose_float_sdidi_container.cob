      *> kb/Work PB253, the 2023 (default --std) edge — ARITHMETIC IS STANDARD-DECIMAL, the same container
      *> rule as the 2014 twin: ISO 15.4.1 "When standard-decimal arithmetic or standard-binary arithmetic is
      *> in effect, the returned value for numeric and integer functions is contained in a temporary standard
      *> data item in the intermediate form defined for the arithmetic mode in effect", with 8.8.1.5.1 making
      *> the mode "a method of evaluating an arithmetic expression, an arithmetic statement, the SUM clause,
      *> and certain integer and numeric functions as specified in 15.4.1". The prose family (ACOS/ASIN/ATAN/
      *> COS/SIN/TAN/LOG/LOG10/RANDOM) has no equivalent arithmetic expression, so 15.4.1's last paragraph
      *> leaves its VALUE implementor-defined — but not its CONTAINER, which is what the receiver-shape-first
      *> arm order bypassed for every receiver-less or float-receiver reference.
      *>
      *> HAND-DERIVED: TINY is the exact scale-20 value 1E-20; for that argument the binary64 sin/tan/atan
      *> results ARE x (the x**3/3 term is ~25 decades below x's ULP), and the 8.8.1.5.1 float -> SDIDI
      *> conversion is the shortest round-trip decimal identity, so the SDIDI is exactly 1E-20 and its
      *> item-92 text is 0.00000000000000000001, never the binary64 E-notation "1E-20".
      *> ACOS(1) / ASIN(0) / LOG(1) / LOG10(1) are 0 exactly and COS(0) is 1 exactly.
      *> The large-magnitude leg pins 15.4.1's invariant instead of an implementor-defined digit string: "the
      *> returned value is the same for all instances of a given function within a single execution of the
      *> runtime element so long as the value and order of the arguments, the collating sequence, and the
      *> locale are unchanged" — before the fix the MOVE channel landed 16331239353195368.96 and the
      *> arithmetic-receiver channel 16331239353195370.00 for the SAME call.
