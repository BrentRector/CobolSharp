      *> ISO §14.9.30.4 GR8 — "If record locking is enabled for the file
      *> connector referenced by file-name-1 and the record identified
      *> for access by the general rules for the READ statement is
      *> locked by THAT file connector, the record lock is ignored and
      *> the READ operation proceeds as if the record were not locked."
      *> §9.1.16 says the same from the other side: "A locked record may
      *> be re-accessed by the same file connector that holds the lock."
      *>
      *> WHY MULTIPLE RECORD LOCKING IS LOAD-BEARING HERE.  Under SINGLE
      *> record locking 12.4.5.9 GR6 makes "execution of any I-O
      *> statement except START release any previously locked record in
      *> that file for that file connector", so a re-read of a record
      *> this connector locked cannot be told apart from a re-read of a
      *> record whose lock had already been dropped — "ignored" and
      *> "released first" are the same observation.  The LOCK ON
      *> MULTIPLE RECORDS phrase (12.4.5.9 GR7) suppresses that release,
      *> so the lock demonstrably still stands across R3.  MULTIPLE
      *> requires a non-sequential organization and access mode
      *> (12.4.5.9.3 SR2), hence relative + ACCESS RANDOM.
      *>
      *> R1  F1's read of record 1 locks it (12.4.5.9 GR4, automatic).
      *> R2  F2's read of record 1 is refused '51' — the lock is REAL.
      *> R3  F1 reads record 2, which under MULTIPLE locking is added to
      *>     F1's held locks; record 1's lock is NOT released.
      *> R4  F1 reads record 1 again.  GR8: the lock is ignored, the
      *>     read succeeds and R001 is made available.  A '51' here
      *>     would mean the self-held lock was treated as foreign.
      *> R5  F2 is STILL refused '51' — proof that R4 ignored the lock
      *>     rather than releasing it, which is the GR6 confound.
