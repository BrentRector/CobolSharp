      *> kb/Work PB367b - AN ENABLED NONFATAL CONDITION RAISED AT A RUNTIME SITE SELECTS ITS USE
      *> DECLARATIVE. Every condition below is detected inside the runtime, not by a guard the emitter
      *> could place around a statement: an untranslatable code unit deep inside an expression, a
      *> dynamic-capacity table growing under a receiving subscript, an inverted THROUGH range in a
      *> condition, a dynamic-length resize. Each used to set the last exception status and RETURN, so
      *> FUNCTION EXCEPTION-STATUS saw the raise and the declarative never ran.
      *>
      *> THE RULE, AND WHERE EACH EXPECTED LINE COMES FROM:
      *>  . 14.6.13.1.4 - "If checking for that exception condition is enabled, processing of the
      *>    statement is interrupted and one of the following occurs in the order specified: ...
      *>    3) If there is an applicable USE statement in the source unit that specifies the
      *>    exception-name associated with the exception condition or an exception-name of a higher
      *>    level in the same hierarchy, the associated declarative is executed. If execution of the
      *>    declarative completes normally, execution continues as specified in the rules for normal
      *>    execution." So each declarative below RUNS (the *-DECL line), and then the statement
      *>    finishes under its own rules - which each condition's own clause names outright:
      *>  . 8.5.1.9.6 GR1 - the implicit growth past the expected capacity raises EC-BOUND-OVERFLOW on
      *>    the FIRST crossing only; the growth itself proceeds (8.5.1.9.5), so WS-E (5) holds 22.
      *>  . 14.7.8 rule 2 - "the EC-RANGE-INVALID exception condition is set to exist, and, upon
      *>    completion of any exception processing, execution proceeds as if the range of values were
      *>    empty", so the IF takes its ELSE branch AFTER the declarative has run.
      *>  . 14.9.39 Format 16 GR37 - a value that is not nonnegative sets the length to 0 and raises
      *>    EC-STORAGE-NOT-AVAIL, so FUNCTION LENGTH answers 0 after the declarative.
      *>  . 15.19.4 rule 3 / CONFORMANCE.md item 209 - a code unit with no one-byte image in the
      *>    8-bit usage-DISPLAY serialization is replaced by the substitution character and
      *>    EC-DATA-CONVERSION is raised, so CONVERT ... HEX answers "3F" (the hexadecimal image of
      *>    '?') after the declarative.
      *>  . 14.6.13.1.1 - "All exception status indicators are cleared at the beginning of the
      *>    execution of any statement", but the LAST EXCEPTION STATUS persists until the next raise
      *>    or SET LAST EXCEPTION TO OFF (14.9.39 Format 13), which is why each EC[...] line below
      *>    shows the name just raised.
      *>  . The four declaratives are selected by 14.9.49.4 GR3 e) - format 3, no file-name-2, a
      *>    level-3 exception-name - and each completes normally (14.6.13.1.2: no EXIT PROGRAM,
      *>    GOBACK, RESUME or STOP, and no fatal exception).
      *> Every value here is COMPUTED FROM THOSE RULES, not from a run.
