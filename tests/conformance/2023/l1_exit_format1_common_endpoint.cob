      *> ISO §14.9.14.4 GR1 — "An EXIT statement serves only to enable
      *> the user to assign a procedure-name to a given point in a
      *> procedure division. Such an EXIT statement has no other effect
      *> on the compilation or execution."
      *> P-EXIT holds a bare EXIT alone in its paragraph (§14.9.14.3
      *> SR1) and is the common end point of PERFORM P1 THRU P-EXIT.
      *> It is reached two ways — by fall-through from P2 and by GO TO
      *> from P1 — and in NEITHER case may it contribute a line of its
      *> own or alter the flow. The only effect of the statement is
      *> that the paragraph-name P-EXIT can be written as a target.
