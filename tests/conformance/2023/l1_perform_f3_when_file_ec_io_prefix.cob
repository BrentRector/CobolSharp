      *> ISO §14.9.28.3 SR16 — "If file-name-2 is specified,
      *> exception-name-2 shall begin with the COBOL characters
      *> 'EC-I-O'."
      *>
      *> The rule is a PREFIX test on the written name, not a
      *> "belongs to the I-O category" test and not a "is a catalogued
      *> I-O name" test — either of which would be a plausible but
      *> DIFFERENT rule. This golden pins the ACCEPT half on the two
      *> shapes that separate the three readings:
      *>   WHEN EC-I-O FILE F1        — the level-2 name itself, which
      *>     begins with the characters and is not a level-3 I-O
      *>     condition, so a level-3-only reading would reject it;
      *>   WHEN EC-I-O-AT-END FILE F2 — an ordinary level-3 I-O name.
      *> The REJECT half is
      *> tests/conformance/negative/l1-perform-f3-sr16-*, which pairs
      *> FILE with a non-I-O catalogued name AND with an open-family
      *> EC-USER- name; the latter is the case a catalog-membership
      *> implementation cannot decide, because §14.6.13.1.1's
      *> EC-USER- family is open and cannot be enumerated.
      *>
      *> The antecedent is read correctly too: it is conditioned on
      *> file-name-2, so the file-name-1 arm (WHEN EXCEPTION
      *> {file-name-1}…) carries no exception-name and is not subject
      *> to it — that arm is exercised by
      *> conformance:2023/l1_perform_f3_when_file_repeat_licensed's
      *> negative siblings.
      *>
      *> SR14 is separately satisfied — F1 and F2 each appear once.
      *> SR15 is separately satisfied — each name appears once.
      *>
      *> The observable is a third WHEN on a user-defined exception
      *> raised by imperative-statement-1, so no file is ever opened
      *> and the run is deterministic (§14.6.13.1.1 makes user-defined
      *> exceptions nonfatal; §14.9.28.4 GR20 then reaches SR16-AFTER).
      *>
      *> EDITION: the exception-checking PERFORM is new in COBOL-2023
