      *> §14.9.10.4 GR19: "The implementor shall define which of the
      *> fixed-file attributes are validated during the execution of the
      *> DELETE FILE statement." COBOL.NET's definition is THE EMPTY SET
      *> (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §7, Annex A.1 item 50 — required and
      *> required to be documented). An empty set is a legal definition:
      *> GR19 requires the implementor to DEFINE the set, never that it
      *> be non-empty.
      *>
      *> The consequence GR18 states is what this golden pins. GR18 sets
      *> '39' when "the attributes of the file connector referenced by
      *> file-name-1 and the fixed file attributes of the physical file"
      *> do not match. With no attribute validated, no mismatch is
      *> detectable, so '39' is unreachable from DELETE FILE BY
      *> DEFINITION rather than by omission — and a DELETE FILE issued
      *> through a connector whose attributes contradict the physical
      *> file's must still succeed.
      *>
      *> F-KILL contradicts F-MAKE in TWO of the attributes §9.1.6 names
      *> as fixed: the ORGANIZATION ("the primary attribute") and the
      *> logical record size in bytes (20 vs 40).
