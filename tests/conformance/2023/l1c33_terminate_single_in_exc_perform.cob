      *> ISO §14.9.46.3 SR3 — single-name TERMINATEs, exception PERFORM
      *> "A TERMINATE statement that specifies more than one report-name
      *> shall not be specified in an exception checking PERFORM
      *> statement."
      *>   cite.py: OK  §14.9.46.3 3)  (Syntax rules)
      *> The companion of conformance:negative/l1c33-terminate-multi-in-
      *> exc-perform: SR3 bans only the MULTI-name form, so two
      *> single-name TERMINATEs in the same PERFORM shape are legal and
      *> must compile and run (an implementation banning TERMINATE in
      *> the PERFORM altogether fails here).
      *> DERIVATION. Both reports are active, so neither TERMINATE
      *> raises EC-REPORT-INACTIVE (§14.9.46.4 GR1, cite.py:
      *> OK  §14.9.46.4 1));
      *> the WHEN EC-REPORT handler does not run -> no "EX"; each report
      *> had one GENERATE, so each RF is produced (§14.9.46.4 GR3 c),
      *> cite.py: OK  §14.9.46.4 3) c)) in statement order -> "RF-A",
      *> "RF-B" via USE BEFORE REPORTING (§14.9.49.4 GR8, cite.py:
      *> OK  §14.9.49.4 8)); then "OK".
