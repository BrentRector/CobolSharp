      *> ISO §14.9.30.4 GR5 — "If the execution of a READ statement with
      *> the INTO phrase is unsuccessful, the content of the data item
      *> referenced by identifier-1 is unchanged and item identification
      *> of the data item referenced by identifier-1 is not done."
      *> Two obligations, one per leg.
      *>
      *> LEG B - CONTENT UNCHANGED.  identifier-1 is loaded with "KEEP"
      *> immediately before an at end READ INTO.  GR5 requires "KEEP"
      *> back; an implementation that ran the GR4b move anyway would
      *> hand back the record area, which still holds the "AAAA" of the
      *> successful LEG A read (GR18 leaves it undefined after an
      *> unsuccessful read, so ANY value other than "KEEP" fails GR5).
      *>
      *> LEG C - ITEM IDENTIFICATION NOT DONE.  identifier-1 is TE(IDX)
      *> with IDX = 5 over a 3-occurrence table, so identifying the item
      *> sets EC-BOUND-SUBSCRIPT (§8.4.2.3.4 GR2, Table 13 fatal).
      *> C1 is the SUCCESSFUL read: GR4b says "Item identification of
      *> the data item referenced by identifier-1 is done after the
      *> record has been read and immediately before it is moved", so
      *> the condition MUST be raised there — that is the positive
      *> control proving the declarative is live and the subscript
      *> really is out of range.  C2 is the at end read: GR5 forbids the
      *> identification, so NO "IDENT=" line may stand between "C1=00"
      *> and "C2-ATEND=10".  The trailing MOVE re-fires the declarative
      *> to show it is still armed after the READs.
      *> The I-O status is stored before the implicit move, so C1 prints
      *> '00' even though the fatal condition was raised inside it.
