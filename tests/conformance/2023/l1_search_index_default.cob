      *> ISO §14.9.37.4 GR3 a) — "If the VARYING phrase is not
      *> specified, the search index is the index referenced by the
      *> first (or only) index-name specified in the INDEXED phrase in
      *> the OCCURS clause associated with identifier-1", together with
      *> GR3's closing sentence: "Only the data item and indexes
      *> indicated are varied by the search operation. All other indexes
      *> associated with identifier-1 are unchanged by the search
      *> operation."
      *> The table is INDEXED BY IX1 IX2 IX3 and holds 1..5. IX1 starts
      *> at 1, IX2 at 5, IX3 at 3, and no VARYING phrase is written.
      *> GR3a makes IX1 the search index; GR4 scans serially from 1 and
      *> occurrence 4 satisfies the WHEN, so GR1a leaves IX1 at 4. IX2
      *> and IX3 are untouched. The legs are distinguishable: had IX2
      *> been the search index the scan would have started at
      *> occurrence 5 (value 5, not 4) and run off the end to AT END.
