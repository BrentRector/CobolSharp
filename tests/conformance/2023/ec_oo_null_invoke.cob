      *> ISO §14.9.23.4 GR5: "If identifier-1 is null, the EC-OO-NULL exception condition is set to exist and
      *> execution of the INVOKE statement is terminated." Table 13: Fatal, so the USE declarative runs and
      *> RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT (§14.9.33) keeps the run unit alive past the terminated INVOKE.
      *>
      *> O is an object reference that is never given an instance, so INVOKE O "PING" invokes on null. Before
      *> this fix the runtime threw uncaught: no statement guard was emitted around an INVOKE, so the
      *> declarative could not select and the run unit died with the condition unhandled.
      *>
      *> ⚠ The raise stays UNCONDITIONAL whether or not checking is enabled — GR5 terminates the INVOKE and a
      *> typed-native model has no conforming value to return from an invocation that did not happen. What
      *> checking ON adds is the guard that lets the named condition reach a declarative, which is what this
      *> golden proves.
