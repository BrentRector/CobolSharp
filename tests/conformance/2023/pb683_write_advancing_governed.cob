      *> ISO §14.9.51.4 GR11 (ALL FILES) — "If record locks have an effect
      *> for the write file connector and the WITH LOCK phrase is specified
      *> or implied, the record lock associated with the record written is
      *> set when the execution of the WRITE statement is successful."  GR10
      *> and GR11 are ALL FILES rules, and §14.9.51.2 Format 1 prints the
      *> ADVANCING phrase, the retry-phrase and the WITH LOCK bracket
      *> TOGETHER, so `WRITE R BEFORE ADVANCING 1 LINE WITH LOCK` is one
      *> legal statement that both advances the medium and locks the record.
      *> §14.9.51.4 GR12 — "The successful execution of a WRITE statement
      *> releases a logical record to the operating environment" — is what
      *> gives a print-control WRITE a record to lock at all.
      *> The other connector is then refused by §9.1.16 ("While locked by a
      *> given file connector, a record is not accessible to another file
      *> connector in the same or a different run unit") with the record
      *> operation conflict status of §14.9.30.4 GR9/GR10 b), '51'.
      *>
      *> ⛔ WHY THIS GOLDEN EXISTS (kb/Work PB683).  The emitter rendered
      *> three different runtime entries for WRITE — plain, ADVANCING, and
      *> the COBOL-2023 combined BEFORE-AND-AFTER form — and only the plain
      *> one was record-lock governed.  Neither print-control entry had a
      *> lock or RETRY parameter at all, so both phrases were silently
      *> dropped and leg A answered '10' where leg B answered '51'.  The
      *> three legs below are the SAME statement in the three printed
      *> shapes; they shall now agree.
      *>
      *> Each leg is one physical file with two connectors, both SHARING
      *> WITH ALL OTHER (which §14.9.27.3 SR8 makes conditional on a LOCK
      *> MODE clause) and LOCK MODE IS MANUAL, so the lock is set only by
      *> the explicit WITH LOCK phrase (§12.4.5.9 GR5).  The reader's
      *> §14.9.30.4 GR9 conflict check precedes the physical retrieval, so
      *> the '51' does not depend on the writer's stream having reached the
      *> medium.
