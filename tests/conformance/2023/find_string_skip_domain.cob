      *> ISO §15.37.4 rule 2 — "If argument-3 is specified, argument-3 represents the number of matches
      *> to ignore before determining the character position that shall be returned." — beyond the small
      *> values every earlier case uses, up to the 18-digit reach this program registers.
      *>
      *> H = "ABCABCABC", ND = "ABC": H(i:3) equals "ABC" at i = 1, 4, 7. Occurrences: {1, 4, 7}.
      *> r2 removes argument-3 of them from consideration BEFORE r1 determines which position is
      *> returned, so in the default direction argument-3 = k returns the (k+1)th occurrence, and under
      *> LAST it returns the (k+1)th occurrence counting from the end. When argument-3 is at least the
      *> number of occurrences, nothing is left to determine and rule 3 ("If no match is found, the
      *> function shall return zero") gives zero.
      *>
      *> An integer data item can carry values far beyond 32 bits — PIC 9(18) reaches
      *> 999999999999999999 — and r2 puts NO ceiling on argument-3, so the comparison against the
      *> occurrence count is a comparison of the FULL integer value. 4294967296 is 2**32, whose low 32
      *> bits are zero: under a 32-bit narrowing it would read as "ignore 0 matches" and return 1,
      *> which r2 and r3 forbid. BIG32 / BIGLIT / BIGC5 / BIG18 pin that across the argument shapes
      *> r3 admits (a display integer item, an integer literal, a binary integer item) and across the
      *> phrases r1 and r4 add. BIGC5 carries 2**32 + 1, not 2**32 + 3: a value whose low 32 bits are 3
      *> already exceeds the three occurrences, so it would return zero under a narrowed reading too and
      *> would pin the COMP-5 carrier without discriminating the narrowing. Low 32 bits of 1 would return
      *> the second occurrence, 4.
      *> SKIP0 and SKIP2 are the population guard: r2 with a value IN range still returns a position.
      *>
      *> The reach ABOVE 2**63 is deliberately not written here, and no claim is made about it.
      *> §15.37.3 r3 puts no ceiling on argument-3's VALUE, so such an argument-3 is a legal argument and
      *> r2/r3 would require zero for it; what this compiler does there has NOT been measured, so nothing
      *> in this file or its report asserts it. Whoever measures it adds the lines here.
