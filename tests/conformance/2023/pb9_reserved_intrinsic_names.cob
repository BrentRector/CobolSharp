      *> 8.4.3.2.3 SR2 lets the word FUNCTION be omitted for any intrinsic the REPOSITORY declares. 8.9 lists
      *> the reserved words and 8.11 the intrinsic function names; their intersection is exactly four -
      *> LENGTH, RANDOM, SIGN, SUM - and three of them were unreachable without the keyword: the parser's
      *> cobolWord funnel excluded them, so `COMPUTE N = SUM(1 2 3)` was COBOL0001. LENGTH already worked and
      *> is the precedent the other three now follow.

      *> ⛔ ADMITTING THEM IS SAFE FOR THE REASON D2's AMBIGUITY DOES NOT APPLY: a reserved word can never be a
      *> user-defined data name (8.3.2.4.1), so `SUM(x)` cannot be a subscripted data reference. The words stay
      *> funnel-gated, so each is still REJECTED in a definition slot - the negative fixture pins that, because
      *> a fix that opened them up as data names would pass this file and still be wrong.

      *> Both reference forms are exercised side by side: the keyword-omitted form and the FUNCTION-keyword
      *> form are the SAME reference and must yield the same value.
