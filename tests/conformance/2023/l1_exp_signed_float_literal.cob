      *> ⛔ WHY THIS LITERAL SHAPE. 2023/signed_float_literal_argument covers `-1.5E1` and
      *> `+1.5E1` - a signed SIGNIFICAND with an UNSIGNED exponent - and pins the binary64
      *> renderings, which are an implementor determination rather than a rule. A SECOND sign in
      *> the same token is exactly where a maximal-munch lexer repair can stop short, and it is
      *> the axis on which this row's verdict was re-taken. Every literal below therefore carries
      *> both signs, and all FOUR sign combinations §8.3.3.3.3 r2 and r3 jointly admit are written
      *> on EXP itself: (-,-) at line 1, (+,+) at line 2, (-,+) at line 3 and (+,-) at line 6.
      *> The (+ significand, - exponent) case is a distinct lexer path - a leading '+' has to open
      *> the signed-literal token while the float body goes on to consume an 'E-' tail - and it is
      *> written NOWHERE else in the corpus: 2023/signed_float_literal_argument has only `-1.5E1`,
      *> `+1.5E1` and `-1.5E3`, every one of them with an UNSIGNED exponent.
      *>
      *> The expected values are the equivalent arithmetic expressions' own values, hand-derived
      *> and pinned by an INCLUSIVE 1E-6 window at the receiver's scale (the general_format_
      *> intrinsics_batch1 convention: >= and <=, never > and <, because a development that lands
      *> exactly ON a window edge is one §15.4.1 expressly admits):
