      *> kb/Work PB323 - the PORTABLE half of the OPEN presence decision.
      *> GR3's authority arm needs a file the process may not read, which
      *> no .cob can arrange, so it is pinned by
      *> unit:FileAuthorityPresenceTests. THIS program pins the other two
      *> answers of the same probe - ABSENT and PRESENT - across all three
      *> organizations and both OPTIONAL states, because PB323 replaced
      *> every connector's File.Exists with the shared three-state
      *> HostFile.Probe and a refactor that got Absent wrong would be a
      *> far louder defect than the one it fixed.

      *> INPUT, I-O, or EXTEND phrase is attempted on a file that is not
      *> described as optional and the physical file is not present".
      *> 14.9.27.4 13): "If the file is not present, and the INPUT phrase
      *> is specified in the OPEN statement, and the OPTIONAL clause is
      *> specified" - Table 18's "Normal open; the first read causes the
      *> at end condition", so '05' then 9.1.13.4 1)'s '10'.
      *> 14.9.27.4 17): "If the file is not present, and the EXTEND or I-O
      *> phrase is specified ... and the OPTIONAL clause is specified, the
      *> OPEN statement creates the file" - '05', and the file is there
