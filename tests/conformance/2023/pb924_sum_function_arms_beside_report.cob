      *> THE OTHER ARM OF ISO 13.18.54.3 SR9 (kb/Work PB924): "Within a
      *> report description entry, if the keyword SUM is preceded by the
      *> keyword FUNCTION, SUM is a reference to the SUM intrinsic
      *> function.  Otherwise, SUM refers to the report writer SUM clause."
      *> The fix makes a bare SUM's '(' an arithmetic parenthesis INSIDE
      *> the report section only; this program pins what that must not
      *> break, in a unit that HAS a report section:
      *>   - FUNCTION SUM(1 2 3) in a report SOURCE clause is the function
      *>     (SR9 first sentence): 1 + 2 + 3 = 6                 => [0006]
      *>   - in the same report, SUM (WS-K * 2) 2 is the clause: one
      *>     GENERATE, 5 * 2 = 10 plus the second addend 2 (GR9) => [0012]
      *>   - after the report section closes, the keyword-omitted SUM(4 5)
      *>     (8.4.3.2.3 SR2, SUM declared in the REPOSITORY) is again the
      *>     intrinsic: 4 + 5 = 9                           => N = 09
