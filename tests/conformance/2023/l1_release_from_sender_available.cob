      *> ISO §14.9.32.4 GR5 — RELEASE … FROM identifier-1: "After the execution of the RELEASE
      *> statement is complete, the information in the area referenced by identifier-1 is
      *> available". The sending area is read back AFTER each RELEASE and again after the SORT.
      *> DERIVATION — every expected line follows from the rule text, nothing from the compiler.
      *>  · SEND1 / SEND2 are GR5 itself: nothing between the MOVEs and the DISPLAY writes to
      *>    WS-SEND, and GR5 requires the RELEASE to leave identifier-1's area available, so each
      *>    DISPLAY shows exactly the eight bytes the preceding MOVEs put there.
      *>  · The SORTED lines are GR4 + §14.9.40.4 GR8 a): the FROM phrase is "equivalent to the
      *>    execution of the following statements in the order specified" — MOVE identifier-1 TO
      *>    record-name-1, then the same RELEASE without FROM — so both records reach the sort
      *>    carrying WS-SEND's content, and ASCENDING SRT-KEY returns "the record containing the
      *>    key data item with the lower value" first: AAA then BBB. This leg is what stops the
      *>    availability check above from passing vacuously on a RELEASE that transferred nothing.
      *>  · SEND3 is GR5 again, past the end of the input procedure: no statement in the output
      *>    procedure names WS-SEND, so it still holds the last value moved into it.
      *> The whole area is displayed inside [ ] so a trailing-blank difference cannot be trimmed
      *> away by the corpus runner's per-line trailing-space normalisation.
