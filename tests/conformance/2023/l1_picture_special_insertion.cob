      *> "a period appears somewhere" would not exercise it. Three
      *> masks are used whose '.' sits at THREE DIFFERENT character
      *> positions, and for each the actual character at that position
      *> and at its two neighbours is displayed. The edited items are
      *> moved to alphanumeric items first (Table 16 of §14.9.25 gives
      *> Yes for numeric-edited into alphanumeric) so the window is cut
      *> with plain reference modification.

      *>                     at position 5 and TA(4:3) shall read 3.5
      *>   EB  PIC 9.9(4)    6 positions; '.' is the 2nd symbol, so
      *>                     TB(1:3) shall read 3.5

      *>                     TC(3:3) shall read *.*

      *> NAMING. The third item is EZ, not the EC the mask order would
      *> suggest: §8.9 lists EC among the reserved words and §8.3.2.4.1
      *> says "Reserved words shall not be used as system-names or
      *> user-defined words.", so EC is not available here.

      *> sending operand to §13.18.40's editing rules for a
      *> numeric-edited receiving item, and the special insertion
      *> symbol is also the decimal point about which that alignment
      *> happens:
      *>   MOVE 3.5 TO EA — four integer digit positions and two
      *>     fractional ones, so 0003 . 50: [0003.50].
      *>   MOVE 3.5 TO EB — one integer digit position and four
      *>     fractional ones, so 3 . 5000: [3.5000].
      *>   MOVE 0 TO EZ — every numeric character position is the
      *>     zero-suppression symbol '*' and the value is zero, so
      *>     editing rule 7b applies: "all character positions of the
      *>     item will contain the character asterisk, but the decimal
      *>     separator, when specified, will appear in the item" —
      *>     [***.**]. This leg is the sharpest reading of rule 4: the
      *>     period holds its position even when every digit position
      *>     around it has been replaced.
      *>
      *> DISTINGUISHABILITY. An implementation that appended the period
      *> at a fixed place (say always before the last two positions),
      *> or that dropped it under full asterisk replacement, or that
      *> aligned the value without regard to where the symbol stands,
      *> would move at least one of the three windows off 3.5 / 3.5 /
      *> *.* while the bracketed images stayed plausible.
