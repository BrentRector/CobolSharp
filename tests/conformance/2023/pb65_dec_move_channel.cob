      *> ISO §15.4.1 r1 / §14.9.25 — the MOVE channel of a STANDARD-DECIMAL function result
      *> (fix-queue PB65). MOVE was the one numeric consumer without the Dec-carrier store case, so
      *> MOVE FUNCTION E failed at backend compile (CS1503) while COMPUTE was exact. Now both
      *> channels land through the SDIDI final transfer: MOVE FUNCTION E into 9V9(30) is the
      *> 31-digit truncation of the exact §15.27.3 r3 constant; EXP10(30)/EXP10(15) is the §15.35.4
      *> r1 EAE evaluated in SDIDI form = 10^15 exactly; and COMBINED-DATETIME of a COMP-2 seconds
      *> value agrees byte-for-byte between MOVE and COMPUTE (the §8.8.1.5.1 lift is the same lift).
