      *> kb/Work PB152 - ISO 11.9.10.4 GR5's FOUR FIGURATIVE fill arms, one runtime element each because a
      *> source unit may carry only one OPTIONS paragraph. (GR5 c, literal-1, is pb152_options_initialize_
      *> background's subject.) GR5: "The character following 'TO' creates the specified-fill-character."
      *>   a) "If BINARY ZEROES is specified, a string of binary zeros is the specified-fill-character."
      *>   b) "If HIGH-VALUES is specified, the alphanumeric high value character is the specified-fill-
      *>      character."
      *>   d) "If LOW-VALUES is specified, the alphanumeric low value character is the specified-fill-
      *>      character."
      *>   e) "If SPACES is specified, the alphanumeric space is the specified-fill-character."
      *>
      *> Each subprogram lays its fill over a VALUE-LESS PIC X(4) (14.6.2.3.2 action 1) and compares the whole
      *> item against the figurative constant the rule names. Comparisons are on the WHOLE item, never on a
      *> reference modification: kb/Work PB297 records that a ref-mod compared against LOW-VALUE/HIGH-VALUE
      *> answers wrong when the ref-mod length differs from the base width.
      *>
      *> BINARY ZEROES and LOW-VALUES coincide for this compiler: the alphanumeric low value of the UTF-16
      *> repertoire IS U+0000, which is also the binary zero. The two arms are still written separately - they
      *> are two different rules, and a fill map that dropped one of them would otherwise pass.
