      *> ISO §14.9.27.4 GR15 — "When the EXTEND phrase is specified,
      *> the OPEN statement positions the file immediately after the
      *> last logical record for that file. The last logical record for
      *> a sequential file is the last record written in the file. The
      *> last logical record for a relative file is the currently
      *> existing record with the highest relative record number. The
      *> last logical record for an indexed file is the currently
      *> existing record with the highest prime key value."
      *> One leg per sentence. §14.9.27.3 SR2 confines EXTEND to
      *> sequential access mode, so every EXTEND connector below is
      *> ACCESS SEQUENTIAL.
      *> SEQUENTIAL. SEQ001, SEQ002 exist; the EXTEND session writes
      *> SEQ003, and the read-back order is 001, 002, 003 — the append
      *> landed AFTER the last record written, not at the front.
      *> RELATIVE. The file is seeded SPARSE — records at relative
      *> record numbers 1 and 4 — through a DYNAMIC connector, so
      *> "highest existing relative record number" (4) and "number of
      *> records" (2) differ. §14.9.51.4 GR29a: in extend mode "the
      *> first record released after the OPEN is assigned a record
      *> number that is one greater than the highest relative record
      *> number existing in the physical file", moved into the RELATIVE
      *> KEY item — so RK must read 0005, not 0003. The read-back walks
      *> 1, 4, 5.
      *> INDEXED. K002 and K006 exist. §14.9.51.4 GR38: under extend
      *> "the first record released … shall have a prime record key
      *> whose value is greater than the highest prime record key value
      *> existing in the physical file when it was opened", else the
      *> WRITE "is unsuccessful, the invalid key condition exists, and
      *> the I-O status … is set to '21'" (§9.1.13.5 item 1). K008 is
      *> accepted; a SECOND extend session then offers K004 as its
      *> FIRST released record and is refused with '21', which is only
      *> possible if that OPEN positioned after K008 — the highest
      *> existing prime key — rather than at the beginning. The final
      *> walk shows the refused record never entered the file.
