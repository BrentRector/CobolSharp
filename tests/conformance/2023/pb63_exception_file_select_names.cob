      *> PB63 - FUNCTION EXCEPTION-FILE / EXCEPTION-FILE-N: the SELECT-spelled name and the "attempted access"
      *> rule. 15.28.4 r2 (the file-connector-name form): a) two alphanumeric spaces while the connector "has
      *> never been opened, attempted to be opened, or otherwise attempted to be accessed"; b) otherwise the
      *> two-character I-O status followed by "the file-name exactly as specified in the SELECT clause"
      *> (r1c/r2b). 9.1.13.1 names CLOSE, DELETE, OPEN, READ, REWRITE, START, UNLOCK and WRITE as the
      *> statements that set the I-O status, so a CLOSE on a never-opened connector (status 42) or a READ on
      *> one (47) IS an attempted access and r2b governs. 15.29.4 r1c/r2b are the national twins.
      *> ARG/ARGN: an EXTERNAL file SELECTed as MixedExtF, read to end-of-file: 10MixedExtF (11 positions,
      *>   the -N result measured through DISPLAY-OF and LENGTH). Before PB63 the display name was recovered
      *>   from the registry KEY (the uppercased external name: 10MIXEDEXTF).
      *> EFC/EFR/EFU: CLOSE Closed -> 42Closed; READ Readf -> 47Readf; Untouch is genuinely never accessed ->
      *>   two spaces (before PB63 only OPEN and DELETE FILE recorded an access, so EFC/EFR were two spaces).
      *> NOARG: the no-argument form after the READ at end-of-file under EC-I-O checking: 10MixedExtF (r1c).
