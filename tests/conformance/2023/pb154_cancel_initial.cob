      *> kb/Work PB154 - 14.9.5 GR3 via 14.6.2.3.2, the SEVEN actions on a
      *> RECURSIVE unit's STATIC working-storage: after CANCEL the next
      *> CALL finds the dynamic-capacity table at its minimum (action 6),
      *> the DYNAMIC LENGTH item at length zero (action 7), the internal
      *> file connector in no open mode (action 3 - reopening answers 00,
      *> not 41), and the BASED item's address NULL (action 5 - the leg
      *> whose static bridge the compiler previously REJECTED as
      *> RecursiveWsPointerBacked on legal source).
      *> RE-PINNED HOST-INDEPENDENTLY (kb/Work PB168): the REOPEN=00 leg
      *> alone was host-locking-dependent - on POSIX a re-registration
      *> hands back a fresh closed connector even if CANCEL's implicit
      *> close never ran; only Windows' sharing violation ('30') would
      *> discriminate. THE FLUSHED LEG PROVES THE FLUSH BY ITS EFFECT ON
      *> EVERY HOST: GROW writes a record it never closes, and reading
      *> it back means the buffered write SURVIVED CANCEL - completed by
      *> the 14.9.5.4 GR9 implicit CLOSE, with Register's displaced-
      *> connector close (the PB168 hygiene, same observable effect) as
      *> the backstop. The leg pins the OUTCOME the standard requires,
      *> not which of the two same-effect mechanisms delivered it.
