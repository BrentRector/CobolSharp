      *> kb/Work PB164 wave 1 - the image predicate on the ONE ByteForm
      *> table: COMP-5 and BINARY-CHAR..DOUBLE leaves have a PINNED
      *> radix-2 big-endian byte form of StorageWidth bytes (A.1 items
      *> 205/208/215), so a group containing them IS image-capable. The
      *> DISCRIMINATING legs (the review fleet caught a same-shape group
      *> MOVE riding the memberwise fast path that never consults the
      *> predicate):

      *> through the alphanumeric intermediary (14.9.25.4 GR4: a group
      *> move "is treated exactly as if it were an alphanumeric to
      *> alphanumeric elementary move ... no conversion" - the bytes
      *> travel, and each leaf decodes its own bytes back). W - the
      *> same round trip for an UNSIGNED 8-byte COMP-5 carrier (ulong;
      *> the codec's unsigned lanes, whose absence made the generated
      *> C# uncompilable). A - CALL BY REFERENCE: "the activated
      *> runtime element operates as if the formal parameter occupies
      *> the same storage area as the argument" (14.2.3 GR8), so the
      *> callee's writes to BOTH leaves are the caller's.
