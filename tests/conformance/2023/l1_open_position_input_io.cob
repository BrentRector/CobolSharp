      *> ISO §14.9.27.4 GR14 — "When the organization of the file
      *> referenced by file-name-1 is sequential or relative and the
      *> INPUT or I-O phrase is specified in the OPEN statement, the
      *> file position indicator for that file connector is set to 1.
      *> When the organization is indexed, the file position indicator
      *> is set to the characters that have the lowest ordinal position
      *> in the collating sequence associated with the file, and the
      *> prime record key is established as the key of reference."
      *> Three organizations, both phrases the rule names.
      *> SEQUENTIAL / RELATIVE, "set to 1". §14.9.30.4 GR21b: "If the
      *> file position indicator was established by a prior successful
      *> OPEN or START statement, the first existing record that is
      *> selected is made available" — so a position of 1 shows as the
      *> FIRST record. Q1/Q2 walk two records; Q3 re-opens and gets the
      *> FIRST one again (the OPEN reset the indicator, it did not
      *> resume); Q4 does the same through the I-O phrase. R1/R2/R3 are
      *> the relative twin, and §14.9.30.4 GR25 moves the relative
      *> record number of the record made available into the RELATIVE
      *> KEY item, so the indicator's value is printed outright: 0001.
      *> INDEXED, "lowest ordinal position … and the prime record key
      *> is established as the key of reference". The three records are
      *> WRITTEN K005, K003, K007 — out of prime order, which
      *> §14.9.51.4 GR39 permits in dynamic access — so "first written"
      *> and "lowest key" differ. X1 = K003 is the lowest prime key.
      *> The alternate key values are A on K005, C on K003, B on K007,
      *> so the two orderings are different sequences. A START on the
      *> alternate makes it the key of reference (§14.9.41.4 GR16) and
      *> the walk follows alternate order: K007 (B) then K003 (C).
      *> After CLOSE and a fresh OPEN INPUT the walk is K003 then K005
      *> — prime order — which is only true if the OPEN re-established
      *> the PRIME key as the key of reference; under the alternate the
      *> first two would be K005 (A) then K007 (B).
