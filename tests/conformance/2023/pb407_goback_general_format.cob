      *> kb/Work PB407 - ISO 14.9.18.2's GENERAL FORMAT, read from the printed figure (PDF page 661 /
      *> printed folio 631, rendered at 300 dpi). The tail bracket carries CHOICE INDICATORS, so per
      *> ISO 5.2.6.4 "zero or more of the alternatives contained within the choice indicators shall be
      *> specified, but any single alternative may be specified only once" and "The alternatives may be
      *> specified in any order" - both phrases, either order, each once. STATUS is not underlined, so
      *> ISO 5.2.3 makes it an optional word; the EXCEPTION after LAST is not underlined either.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES ARE DERIVED FROM THE RULES, NOT MEASURED. Each subprogram DISPLAYs before its
      *> GOBACK and the main program DISPLAYs after each CALL, so the order is fixed by ISO 14.9.18.4 GR2
      *> ("control to return to the calling statement"). The status phrase reaches the operating system
      *> ONLY in a main program (GR7-GR10 each open "If the GOBACK ... is executing in a main program"),
      *> so in these CALLED programs it is screened and then inert - the run unit's own STOP RUN decides
      *> the termination indication. The RAISING phrase raises in the ACTIVATOR only "if checking for that
      *> exception condition is enabled in the activating runtime element" (GR1 b)); no >>TURN appears
      *> here, so nothing is raised and every CALL returns normally.
      *>
      *> The status phrase is a COBOL-2023 introduction (Annex E.3.3 item 32), which is why this golden
      *> lives at 2023. The RAISING LAST spelling in PB407D is 2002-available and is carried here because
      *> it shares the one raisingPhrase grammar rule with the spellings above it.
