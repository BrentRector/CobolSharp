      *> ISO §13.18.63.3 SR28 — "The words THROUGH and THRU are
      *> equivalent." — printed in the FORMAT 3 (condition-name) block;
      *> SR36 imports it into FORMAT 5, whose content-validation entry
      *> is a DECLINED feature here and so is not exercised.
      *>
      *> An EQUIVALENCE rule is testable only in BOTH directions on the
      *> SAME entry shape: declare the condition-name twice over one
      *> conditional variable, once with each word, and assert the two
      *> membership images are identical. That fails if EITHER spelling
      *> drifts. ⛔ Each line also PRINTS the shared image, so it cannot
      *> pass VACUOUSLY: two condition-names that were both always
      *> false would still compare equal, and "FFFFFFFFFF" is not the
      *> derived image.
      *>
      *> Before this golden NOT ONE program in the corpus wrote the
      *> word THROUGH in a VALUE clause — every level-88 range on disk
      *> spells it THRU, so the THROUGH half of the rule was untested.
      *>
      *> DERIVED EXPECTATIONS — from the rule text, not from a run.
      *> §13.18.63.4 GR18 sends the range to §14.7.8, whose rule 1
      *> makes a numeric range include "literal-1, literal-2, and all
      *> algebraic values between literal-1 and literal-2"; §8.8.4.5.3
      *> GR1 tests the conditional variable "within the specified range
      *> or ranges, including the end values" and GR3 makes the test
      *> true when one of the values equals the variable. §13.18.63.3
      *> SR26 a) requires literal-2 < literal-3, which 1 < 5, 1 < 2 and
      *> 8 < 9 satisfy. Position p of each image is the verdict for
      *> CV = p - 1, so with CV walking 0 … 9:
      *>   RANGE  1 THRU 5 is true at 1,2,3,4,5 (ENDS INCLUDED) and
      *>          false at 0 and at 6 … 9  =>  FTTTTTFFFF
      *>   LIST   two ranges in one clause, 1 THRU 2 and 8 THRU 9, is
      *>          true at 1,2,8,9 and false elsewhere  =>  FTTFFFFFTT
      *> The LIST arm matters because it puts the word in its SECOND
      *> occurrence inside one VALUE clause, and because a range that
      *> swallowed the rest of the list would print FTTTTTTTTT.
      *>
      *> The production carries no version predicate, so the row is
      *> 85/2002/2014/2023; the edition-floor twin
      *> 85/l1_value_thru_through_equivalent_85 is the copy that goes
      *> red if the word is ever edition-gated.
