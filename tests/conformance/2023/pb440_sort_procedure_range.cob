      *> kb/Work PB440 (sibling) - a SORT INPUT PROCEDURE range is resolved by the SAME procedure resolver
      *> as PERFORM, so it inherited the same defect: the emitter decoded "is this range empty?" as
      *> `Start <= End`, which is ALSO true of a legal INVERTED range, and dropped the whole procedure.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE SPEC AND NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>
      *> SORT 1 - INPUT PROCEDURE IS IN-B THRU IN-A, where IN-A physically PRECEDES IN-B. 14.9.28.4 GR6,
      *>   which governs the identically-composed PERFORM range, says "There is no necessary relationship
      *>   between procedure-name-1 and procedure-name-2 except that a consecutive sequence of operations is
      *>   to be executed beginning at the procedure named procedure-name-1 and ending with the execution of
      *>   the procedure named procedure-name-2" - so an inverted range is legal and is reached by the GO TO
      *>   written in IN-B. 14.9.40.4 GR11: "The compiler inserts a return mechanism after the last statement
      *>   in the input procedure", which is IN-A's fall-through. The procedure therefore RELEASES C, A, B,
      *>   and 14.9.40.4 GR8 a) - "If the contents of the corresponding key data items are not equal and the
      *>   key is associated with the ASCENDING phrase, the record containing the key data item with the lower
      *>   value is returned first" - orders them:
      *>       OUT=A / OUT=B / OUT=C.
      *>   Before the fix the whole input procedure was skipped and NO record was released at all.
      *> SORT 2 - INPUT PROCEDURE IS EMPTY-IN, a section with zero paragraphs (14.4.2). There is no first
      *>   statement to transfer to, so nothing is released and the output procedure returns no record:
      *>       EMPTYIN CNT=0.
