      *> ISO §14.9.41.4 GR3 — "The execution of the START statement
      *> does not detect, acquire, or release record locks."
      *> Three prohibitions, one line of evidence each. Two file
      *> connectors, FA and FB, share one physical indexed file with
      *> SHARING WITH ALL OTHER and LOCK MODE IS AUTOMATIC, so
      *> §12.4.5.9.4 GR4 applies — "If the AUTOMATIC phrase is
      *> specified, the lock mode is automatic. Records are locked when
      *> any READ statement is executed."
      *>   AREAD   FA reads BBB200 -> '00', and by GR4 now holds its
      *>           lock.
      *>   BLOCKED FB reads the same record -> '51' (§9.1.13.8 item 1,
      *>           "an attempt to access a record that is currently
      *>           locked by another file connector"). This line makes
      *>           the three that follow meaningful: without it a
      *>           uniform '00' would prove nothing.
      *>   ASTART  FA issues a START. It succeeds, '00'.
      *>   STILL   ...does NOT RELEASE: FB's read of BBB200 is STILL
      *>           '51'. §12.4.5.9.4 GR6 states the same exemption from
      *>           the other side — "Execution of any I-O statement
      *>           except START releases any previously locked record
      *>           in that file for that file connector" — so had this
      *>           been a READ instead, FB would now see '00'.
      *>   NOTHELD ...does NOT ACQUIRE: CCC300, the record FA's START
      *>           positioned at, is NOT locked, so FB reads it '00'.
      *>   BSTART  ...does NOT DETECT: FB starts on BBB200, the record
      *>           FA holds locked, and gets '00' — a START never
      *>           consults the lock, where FB's READ of the very same
      *>           record was refused.
      *> The three records are seeded through a third connector that is
      *> closed before FA and FB open, so Table 19 (§14.9.27.4 GR4) has
      *> only the two sharing-with-all-other connectors to arbitrate,
      *> and both opens are "Normal open".
