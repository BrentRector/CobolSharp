      *> kb/Work PB201 - THE CARRIER axis of a position operand; the twin of

      *> ISO 8.8.1.1 admits "an identifier referencing a numeric data item" and
      *> 8.4.2.3.2 makes a subscript arithmetic-expression-1, so EVERY numeric
      *> carrier is legal in the position; 8.4.3.3.3 rule 4 ("leftmost-position
      *> and length shall be arithmetic expressions") carries the same rule to a
      *> reference-modification bound. 8.4.2.3.4 GR1b makes the subscript "the
      *> result of the evaluation of arithmetic-expression-1", so an INTEGRAL
      *> float value selects its occurrence and raises nothing.
