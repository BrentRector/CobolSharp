      *> ISO §14.9.30.4 GR24 a) — "The I-O status of the file connector
      *> associated with file-name-1 is set to '10' to indicate the at
      *> end condition, and, if enabled, the EC-I-O-AT-END exception
      *> condition is set to exist."
      *> The two conjuncts are independent, and the SECOND is the one
      *> only this golden reaches: GR24 c) makes a written AT END phrase
      *> suppress "any other applicable exception processing
      *> statements", but a) sets the exception condition BEFORE c) is
      *> reached ("the following occurs IN THE ORDER SPECIFIED"), so the
      *> condition exists even though nothing handles it.  §9.1.13.1
      *> supplies the status-to-condition correspondence for the '1x'
      *> family.  §15.33.1: "The EXCEPTION-STATUS function returns an
      *> alphanumeric value that is the exception-name associated with
      *> the last exception status" — the observable for "set to exist".
      *> An implementation that set the EC only on the declarative path
      *> — i.e. after the GR24 c) short-circuit — would print two blank
      *> or stale EC lines here while still passing every status check.
