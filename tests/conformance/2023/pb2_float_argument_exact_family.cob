      *> PB2 - a FLOATING-POINT argument to an exact-family intrinsic.
      *> ISO 15.7.3 r1 and its siblings require class NUMERIC; a COMP-2 item IS class numeric (8.5.2.1
      *> Table 2), so every call below is legal COBOL. Before this fix the emitter dispatched on the
      *> FUNCTION's family rather than the ARGUMENT's type and handed a double to an Int128 parameter, so
      *> ten of these produced a raw Roslyn CS1503 that escaped as a backend error on legal source.
      *>
      *> ⛔ MOD LEFT THE FLOAT PAIR AT kb/Work PB248, and the correction is about WHICH RULE MOD CARRIES, not
      *> about the class reading above. This header's "class numeric, therefore legal" reasoning holds for
      *> every 'n'-family row here - REM included, whose 15.77.3 r1 says "shall be of class numeric" - but
      *> MOD's own 15.64.3 r1 says "Argument-1 and argument-2 shall be INTEGERS", which is 15.3's argument
      *> TYPE 6, not a class: "an arithmetic expression that will always result in an integer value or an
      *> integer data item". A floating-point item is neither (14.6.8.3 sets its content to "the algebraic
      *> value of the sending operand", so its declared value set contains non-integers) - the same reading
      *> that has rejected a PIC 9V9 operand at an integer position since PB40. MOD therefore takes integer
      *> operands here; the FLOAT-operand coercion it used to prove is now proved under --permissive by
      *> FloatIntegerArgumentPermissiveTests, which is the lane that semantics moved to.
      *>
      *> Every expected value is DERIVED FROM THE SPEC, not observed: the sign-discriminating pairs are the
      *> point of the fixture, because a wrong body agrees with a right one on positive operands.
      *>   15.64.4 MOD          floored  - result takes the sign of argument-2 => MOD(-7,3)  =  2
      *>   15.77.4 REM          truncated- result takes the sign of argument-1 => REM(-7,3)  = -1
