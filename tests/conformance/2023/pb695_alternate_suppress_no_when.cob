      *> kb/Work PB695 family 3 - WHEN is an OPTIONAL WORD of the SUPPRESS phrase.
      *> ISO 8.3.2.4.3: "Within each format, uppercase words that are not underlined are called
      *> optional words and may be specified at the user's option WITH NO EFFECT ON THE SEMANTICS OF
      *> THE FORMAT." Printed page 350 / folio 320 carries an underline rectangle under SUPPRESS
      *> (x 254.17-299.45 beneath a box of 252.66-300.40, 94.8% cover) and under DUPLICATES (95.8%),
      *> and NONE anywhere in WHEN's band (box 303.50-334.12; the nearest rule ends at 299.45). WITH
      *> is un-underlined too. So `DUPLICATES SUPPRESS "XX"` is a conforming spelling of the same
      *> clause that altkey_suppress_when.cob writes in full, and it must behave IDENTICALLY.

      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED FROM THE SPEC - NOT copied from the sibling golden:
      *> 12.4.5.6.4 GR6 withholds the ALTERNATE access path of a record whose alternate key equals
      *> literal-1, and its NOTE says such a record "is not considered to exist" for READ/START on
      *> that key - so the alternate-key walk yields 01/AA and 03/BB and skips 02/XX. GR6 leaves the
      *> record and its PRIME-key path untouched, so the prime-key walk yields all three keys in
      *> ascending order (12.4.5.20 / 14.9.32.4 GR9 c: sequential access on an indexed file returns
      *> records in ascending record-key order).
