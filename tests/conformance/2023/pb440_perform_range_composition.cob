      *> kb/Work PB440 - how an out-of-line PERFORM's SPECIFIED SET OF STATEMENTS is composed (ISO 14.9.28.4
      *> GR4/GR5/GR6). Every shape below was previously pinned ONLY by AssertSameAsLegacy differentials in
      *> SectionDifferentialTests, which measure the legacy oracle and can close no row; this program measures
      *> the rule.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE SPEC AND NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>
      *> EMPTYPARA - EMPTY-PARA is a paragraph with NO sentences. It still has its own place in the procedure
      *>   sequence, so GR4's set is "all statements beginning with the first statement of procedure-name-1 and
      *>   ending with the last statement of procedure-name-1" over a paragraph that has none: nothing runs, and
      *>   GR5 a)'s return mechanism ("after the last statement of procedure-name-1") fires immediately, so the
      *>   FOLLOWING paragraph PA does NOT run. Three times over nothing is still nothing => N=0000.
      *>   (This is the case that must stay correct after PB440 made the empty SECTION a first-class range.)
      *> PARATHRU  - GR4: PERFORM PA THRU PC is "all statements beginning with the first statement of PA and
      *>   ending with the last statement of PC" => 1 + 2 + 4, and GR5 b) puts the return after PC's last
      *>   statement, so PD does not run => N=0007.
      *> SECTION   - procedure-name-2 omitted and procedure-name-1 a SECTION: the set runs from the first
      *>   statement of its first paragraph through the last statement of its last (GR4 + 14.4.3), and GR5 a)
      *>   returns there, so NEXT-SEC does not run => 10 + 20 = N=0030.
      *> SAMETHRU  - PERFORM WORK-SEC THRU WORK-SEC names the same section twice; GR4's set is unchanged and
      *>   GR5 b)'s return is after the same last statement => N=0030.
      *> INVERTED  - GR6: "There is no necessary relationship between procedure-name-1 and procedure-name-2
      *>   except that a consecutive sequence of operations is to be executed beginning at the procedure named
      *>   procedure-name-1 and ending with the execution of the procedure named procedure-name-2." INV-A
      *>   physically PRECEDES INV-B and is reached by the GO TO written in INV-B, so the sequence is INV-B then
      *>   INV-A => 200 + 100 = N=0300. (NIST NC102A PFM-TEST-F1-10 is the same shape.)
      *> SPAN      - procedure-name-1 is the EMPTY section EMPTY-SEC (14.4.2). It has no first statement, so the
      *>   consecutive sequence GR6 describes begins at what follows it, and GR5 b) puts the return after
      *>   TAIL-SEC's last statement => TAIL-P runs once => N=1000. The composition needs no special case.
