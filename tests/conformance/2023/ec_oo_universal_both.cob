      *> ISO §14.9.23.4 GR7c: for an INVOKE through a UNIVERSAL object reference, "the rules for conformance
      *> specified in 14.8.2, Parameters and 14.8.3, Returning items apply. If a violation of these rules is
      *> detected, the EC-OO-UNIVERSAL exception condition is set to exist IF CHECKING FOR IT IS ENABLED IN
      *> BOTH the activated method and the activating runtime element, the method invocation is not successful,
      *> and execution continues as specified in General rule 7g."
      *>
      *> The argument is PIC 9(6) against a PIC 9(4) formal — a descriptor mismatch the compile-time check
      *> cannot see, because the receiver is universal. Checking is enabled ONCE at the top of the compilation
      *> group, so it covers both the activating program and the method: enabled in BOTH, so the condition IS
      *> set, the declarative selects, and RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT keeps the run unit alive.
      *>
      *> The paired golden ec_oo_universal_not_both is the same program with checking enabled only in the
      *> ACTIVATOR — there the condition is NOT set and nothing may be attributed to EC-OO-UNIVERSAL.
