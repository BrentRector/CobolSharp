      *> ISO §14.9.37.4 GR3 b) 1 — "If identifier-2 references an index
      *> data item, that data item is incremented by the same amount as,
      *> and at the same time as, the search index."
      *> GR4 increments the search index by ONE OCCURRENCE NUMBER per
      *> unsuccessful pass, so "the same amount" is one occurrence
      *> number per pass. §13.18.60.4 GR10 (USAGE) fixes the only
      *> portable reading of an index data item's content: it "contains
      *> a value that shall correspond to an occurrence number", the
      *> stored representation being implementor-defined — so the item
      *> is seeded and read back through an index-name (§14.9.39.4 GR2
      *> b) and c)), never displayed directly.
      *> Leg A: index data item at occurrence 2, search index at 1,
      *>        match at occurrence 4 = THREE passes -> 2 + 3 = 5.
      *> Leg B: index data item at occurrence 1, search index at 3,
      *>        match at occurrence 4 = ONE pass -> 1 + 1 = 2.
      *> The two legs differ in the DELTA, not the absolute value, which
      *> is what "the same amount" requires and what distinguishes it
      *> from an assignment of the search index.
