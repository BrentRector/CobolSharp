       *> observe: WHICH of the two names each surface reports.
       *>
       *> 1. FUNCTION MODULE-NAME(CURRENT) reports the DECLARED name PB303MO, not the AS
       *>    literal.  ISO 15.65.4 r4 leaves the FORM implementor-defined - "The
       *>    implementor may return the name as specified in the program-id, function-id,
       *>    or method-id paragraph.  They may also return the name as specified in the AS
       *>    clause of the Identification Division if used" - and docs/CONFORMANCE.md
       *>    DOC-A.1-135 documents the program-id form.  WS-NAME is PIC X(10) and
       *>    "PB303MO" is seven characters, so the MOVE space-fills three to the right
       *>    (ISO 14.9.24.4 GR3, alphanumeric receiving item) - the brackets make that
       *>    fill visible, and a compiler returning the eight-character "PB303MOX" would
       *>    show one fewer space.
       *> 2. INVOKE WS-OBJ "PB303MDX" reaches METHOD-ID PB303MD AS "PB303MDX".  ISO
       *>    14.9.23.2 gives INVOKE no WORD form for the method at all - only literal-1 or
       *>    identifier-2 - and 14.9.23.4 GR2 a) resolves that literal "as described in
       *>    8.3.2.2, User-defined words", i.e. against the externalized name.  The method
       *>    is therefore reachable ONLY under its AS literal, exactly as CALL is.
       *> 3. CLASS-ID PB303CL AS "PB303CLX" carries the phrase too (ISO 11.3.2), while the
       *>    object-class-name stays the word every reference uses (8.4.6.4) - the
       *>    REPOSITORY entry and the OBJECT REFERENCE clause below both name PB303CL.
