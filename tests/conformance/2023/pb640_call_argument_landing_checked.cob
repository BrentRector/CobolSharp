      *> kb/Work PB640 - the ACTIVATING element performs the GR9/GR10 argument crossing, so a
      *> BY CONTENT / BY VALUE numeric argument that overflows its formal's description raises
      *> EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION in the CALLER, under the CALLER's checking, before control transfers.
      *>
      *> THE RULE. ISO 14.2.3 GR9 (second branch: a prototyped program, an AS NESTED CALL, a
      *> method or a function) and GR10 both say the linkage record is "allocated by the
      *> activating runtime element during the process of initiating the activation", and both
      *> make the argument the sending operand of - "if the formal parameter is numeric, a
      *> COMPUTE statement without the ROUNDED phrase" - into it. A magnitude the formal cannot
      *> hold is 14.7.5 case 3, "after radix point alignment ... further from zero than permitted
      *> for the associated resultant data item", whose no-SIZE-ERROR-phrase rule 4 states: "if
      *> the result of the arithmetic statement is a value further from zero than permitted for
      *> the associated resultant data item, the EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION exception condition is set to
      *> exist". EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION is Table 13 FATAL, and 14.9.4.4 GR3 g) transfers control to
      *> the called program only "if a fatal exception condition has not been raised" - so the
      *> callee is NOT entered, GR3 h) item 2 runs the activating element's applicable exception
      *> processing statements (this USE declarative), and RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT continues
      *> after the CALL. Before PB640 the whole crossing ran CALLEE-side, where the caller's
      *> checking state and declaratives are out of scope, so every row below printed the callee's
      *> low-order digits silently.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED:
      *>  A1/A2 - BIG is 10**30 and the formal is PIC S9(9)V9(9). Aligned at scale 9 the result
      *>    is 10**39, which is further from zero than 18 digit positions permit => case 3 =>
      *>    EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION. BY CONTENT (GR9) and BY VALUE (GR10) are the SAME COMPUTE, so the
      *>    two rows must agree, and neither REF= nor VAL= may print.
      *>  A3 - the in-range control: 123.456 fits PIC S9(9)V9(9) exactly, so the landing raises
      *>    nothing and the callee prints +000000123.456000000.
      *>  A4 - the GR8 control: BY REFERENCE is "as if the formal parameter occupies the same
      *>    storage area as the argument" - no allocated record, no COMPUTE, no size error - and
      *>    the descriptions are identical, so the same characters print.
      *>  A5 - the LITERAL argument arm. 123456789012345678 aligned at scale 2 is
      *>    12345678901234567800, past the 6 digit positions of PIC S9(4)V99 => case 3 =>
      *>    EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION, and SML= does not print.
      *>  FUNCTION EXCEPTION-STATUS is the level-3 name (14.6.13.1.6), blank-padded to its
