      *> THE EXACT CARRIER'S ESCAPE BOUNDARY IS A SIZE ERROR, NEVER A WRAP.
      *> COBOLNET_NUMERIC_DESIGN.md's substrate paragraph fixes the policy: "the Int128 escape boundary is
      *> reached only when a single product ... exceeds Int128 (~38 digits) -> EC-SIZE-OVERFLOW". 15.4.1 asks at
      *> worst for "an implementor-defined approximation of the value of that expression", and a value produced by
      *> a silent modulo-2^128 wrap approximates nothing.
      *>
      *> ⛔ THIS GOLDEN EXISTS BECAUSE MEDIAN AND MIDRANGE SPENT A DIGIT THEIR SIBLINGS DO NOT (fix-queue PB32).
      *> Both return at scale common+1 so that their halving is exact - odd MEDIAN multiplies the middle by 10,
      *> even MEDIAN and MIDRANGE multiply the sum by 5 - and that scale bump costs a decimal digit of Int128
      *> headroom which MAX, MIN, SUM and RANGE never spend. So these two wrapped at ONE FIFTH the magnitude their
      *> siblings survive, silently, with an ON SIZE ERROR phrase present and NOT taken. MEASURED before the fix:
      *>     MAX      -> 99999999999999999999999999999.98   (exact)
      *>     MIN      ->                             0.00   (exact)
      *>     MIDRANGE -> 15971763307906153653662539256.81   (WRONG, and no size error)
      *>     hand EAE -> 49999999999999999999999999999.99   (correct, same compiler, same run)
      *> The compiler contradicting its OWN written 15.62.4 equivalent arithmetic expression, on legal source, is
      *> what makes this MIDRANGE's own defect rather than shared alignment residue: MAX and MIN are both right.
      *>
      *> ⚠ THE GUARD MUST NOT OVER-FIRE. The ordinary-magnitude cases below are the other half of the evidence -
      *> a boundary check that also broke MEDIAN(1 2 3 4) would trade a silent wrong answer for a loud one.
