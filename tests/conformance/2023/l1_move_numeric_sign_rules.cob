      *> ⛔ THE SIGN IS READ THROUGH AN EDITED ITEM, NEVER THROUGH A DISPLAY OF THE SIGNED ITEM.
      *> The representation of an operational sign on a USAGE DISPLAY item is an implementor
      *> determination (§13.18.52, SIGN clause — the overpunch that move_group_overpunch pins), so a
      *> DISPLAY of a signed item would measure that choice and not this rule. PIC -999 is the
      *> standard's own instrument: §13.18.40.5 rule 5, fixed insertion editing, Table 8 "Results of
      *> fixed insertion editing" gives the editing symbol '-' the result "space" for a positive or
      *> zero value and the minus character for a negative value.
      *>   python scripts/spec/cite.py --check 13.18.40.5 "Table 8, Results of fixed insertion
      *>   editing, shows the character(s) produced by an editing sign control symbol, depending on
      *>   the value of the data item."  ->  OK  §13.18.40.5 5)  (Editing rules)
      *> The §8.8.4.7 simple sign condition is the second, independent instrument: it "determines
      *> whether or not the algebraic value of an arithmetic expression is less than, greater than,
      *> or equal to zero", so it reads the stored VALUE rather than any rendering. Both are
      *> reported for each arm; a stored sign that failed to survive would break both.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, derived line by line:
      *>   A-UNSIGNED-SENDER  rule a, second sentence: "If the sending operand is unsigned, the sign
      *>                      shall be positive." PIC 9(3) VALUE 456 -> PIC S9(3) is +456, and
      *>                      Table 8 renders a positive value's '-' position as a SPACE: [ 456].
      *>   A-POS             the same fact through the sign condition: T.
      *>   A-NEG-SENDER      rule a, first sentence: the sign of the numeric value (-123) shall be
      *>                      represented in the receiving operand, so PIC -999 shows [-123].
      *>   A-NEG             the same fact through the sign condition: T.
      *>   A-POS-SENDER      a SIGNED sender that is positive keeps its sign: +789 -> [ 789].
      *>   B-UNSIGNED-RCVR   rule b: PIC S9(3) VALUE -123 into PIC 9(3) uses the ABSOLUTE VALUE,
      *>                      so the unsigned receiver holds 123 and DISPLAYs [123].
      *>   B-EDITED          rule b's second half, "no operational sign is generated for the
      *>                      receiving item": re-edited through PIC -999 the value is positive, so
      *>                      Table 8 gives a space: [ 123]. A generated negative sign would show.
      *>   B-NEG             the sign condition on the unsigned receiver: F.
      *>   F-SIGNED /        the rule's own FLOAT arm. Its opening sentence is implementor latitude
      *>   F-UNSIGNED        ("the implementor specifies ... alignment of the data by decimal
      *>                      point"), so this fixture uses an INTEGRAL float value, -125, which is
      *>                      exactly representable in FLOAT-SHORT and whose alignment by decimal
      *>                      point is the same under any choice the implementor could make. What is
      *>                      pinned is only what rules a and b fix and latitude does not: the
      *>                      signed receiver shows [-125] and the unsigned receiver, by rule b's
      *>                      absolute value, shows [125].
