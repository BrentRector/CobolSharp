      *> ISO §14.9.49.4 GR10: "If a GENERATE, INITIATE, or TERMINATE statement is executed within the range of
      *> a declarative procedure whose USE statement contains the BEFORE REPORTING phrase, the EC-FLOW-REPORT
      *> exception condition is set to exist, the result of the execution of the GENERATE, INITIATE, or
      *> TERMINATE statement is unsuccessful, and the state of the report is unchanged."
      *>
      *> The CHECKED half (its unconditional twin, at the edition with no >>TURN at all, is
      *> 85/pb326_flow_report_unconditional).  Table 13 makes EC-FLOW-REPORT Fatal, so under
      *> >>TURN … CHECKING ON the format-3 declarative runs and RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT (§14.9.33) returns to
      *> the statement after the nested GENERATE — i.e. back into the BEFORE REPORTING procedure, which then
      *> completes normally and the outer presentation proceeds.
      *>
      *> The program is legal: §14.9.49.3 SR10 forbids GENERATE/INITIATE/TERMINATE only "in a paragraph within a
      *> USE BEFORE REPORTING procedure", and GEN-P is a paragraph of a DIFFERENT declarative section, which SR4
      *> expressly lets BR-P reach with a PERFORM.

      *> DERIVATION OF THE EXPECTED OUTPUT.  The single GENERATE presents DET-1; §14.9.49.4 GR8/GR9d run BR-P
      *> just before the group's LINE clauses are processed.  BR-P sets WS-N to 1 and PERFORMs GEN-P, whose
      *> GENERATE is inside the range: EC-FLOW-REPORT is raised (the declarative prints HANDLED=), the GENERATE
      *> is unsuccessful and the report's state is unchanged.  The outer presentation then composes DET-1 with
      *> WS-N = 1.  Expected, in execution order: HANDLED=EC-FLOW-REPORT, N=1, and EXACTLY ONE detail line D=1.
