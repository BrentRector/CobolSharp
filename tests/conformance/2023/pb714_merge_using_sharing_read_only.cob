      *> kb/Work PB714 — MERGE's two implicit OPENs carry the SHARING
      *> phrases their general rules name, exactly as SORT's do.  The
      *> emitter serves both verbs from one pair of methods, so this golden
      *> is what keeps the MERGE half from being an unexercised claim.
      *>
      *> ISO 14.9.24.4 GR7 a) (USING): "The processing of the file is
      *> initiated.  If the file-control entry for the file has a SHARING
      *> clause with the ALL phrase, the initiation is performed as if an
      *> OPEN statement with the INPUT phrase and the SHARING WITH READ ONLY
      *> phrase had been executed; otherwise, the initiation is performed as
      *> if an OPEN statement with the INPUT phrase and without a SHARING
      *> phrase is executed."
      *> ISO 14.9.24.4 GR12 a) (GIVING): "The processing of the file is
      *> initiated.  The initiation is performed as if an OPEN statement
      *> with the OUTPUT and SHARING WITH NO OTHER phrases had been
      *> executed."
      *>
      *> 9.1.13.1 and 12.4.5.8.4 GR1 are what make either refusal readable:
      *> the I-O status of the as-if OPEN is stored into the FILE STATUS
      *> item before the USE procedure GR7 a) / GR12 a) invoke runs.  Every
      *> status item is seeded "ZZ" so a status that was never stored would
      *> show as such.

      *> LEG 1 — the USING arm.  FA declares the ALL phrase, so its implicit
      *> OPEN carries SHARING WITH READ ONLY; FA-OTH holds the same physical
      *> file open EXTEND, and Table 19 row "SHARING WITH READ ONLY / INPUT"
      *> x column "sharing with all other / extend I-O output" is
      *> Unsuccessful open => 9.1.13.9 item 1 => '61'.  FB is untouched, so
      *> the merge still delivers FB's records: GR4 orders equal keys by
      *> USING-file order, and a file that released nothing contributes
      *> nothing.
