      *> ISO §14.9.30.4 GR10 a) — "If the record operation conflict
      *> condition exists as a result of the READ statement: a) The file
      *> position indicator is unchanged."  GR13 a) says it from the
      *> other side: "The I-O status associated with file-name-1 is
      *> updated and, if the record operation conflict condition did not
      *> occur, the file position indicator is set."
      *>
      *> THE SUBJECT.  Three legs, one per ORGANIZATION — record
      *> sequential, relative and indexed — differing in NOTHING but the
      *> ORGANIZATION clause.  Each seeds three records through a plain
      *> connector, opens two SHARING WITH ALL OTHER / LOCK MODE MANUAL
      *> connectors A and B on it, has A lock the FIRST record with
      *> READ ... WITH LOCK (§12.4.5.9.4 GR5 — a manual lock is obtained
      *> only with the explicit phrase), then walks B.
      *>
      *> B1.  §14.9.30.4 GR9 — "If record locking is enabled for the
      *> file connector referenced by file-name-1 and the record
      *> identified for access is locked by another file connector ...
      *> If the RETRY phrase is not specified ... the record operation
      *> conflict condition exists."  §9.1.13.8 item 1 prices it '51'.
      *> The record identified for access is the FIRST existing record:
      *> B's file position indicator was established by its own OPEN, so
      *> §14.9.30.4 GR21 selects "the first existing record that is
      *> selected ... regardless of whether NEXT or PREVIOUS is
      *> specified" (relative rule b, sequential rule b) / indexed rule
      *> d) 1.).  GR10 c) makes the record area undefined, so B1 shows
      *> the STATUS only.
      *>
      *> B2 — THE POINT OF THE TEST.  After the lock is released
      *> (UNLOCK, §14.9.47.4 GR1), B's very next sequential READ shall
      *> deliver THAT SAME FIRST RECORD, because GR10 a) left B's file
      *> position indicator exactly where its OPEN put it.  '46' is NOT
      *> the answer: §9.1.13.7 item 6 requires BOTH that "a sequential
      *> READ statement is attempted referencing a file connector open
      *> in the input or I-O mode AND NO VALID NEXT RECORD HAS BEEN
      *> ESTABLISHED" and one of its two causes, and GR10 a) is exactly
      *> §14.9.30.4 GR18's "Unless otherwise specified" — GR18's blanket
      *> invalidation of the position on an unsuccessful READ is
      *> displaced here, so a valid next record IS still established.
      *> (Read the other way, GR10 a) and GR10 d) would have no
      *> observable consequence anywhere, and a '51' on a
      *> sequential-ORGANIZATION file — which has no START to reposition
      *> with — would be unrecoverable.)
      *>
      *> B3 is the control: the walk continues normally to the SECOND
      *> record, proving B2 was a re-delivery of the first and not a
      *> stalled indicator.
      *>
      *> LEG P - THE OTHER DIRECTION.  The record identified for access
      *> is direction-sensitive: §14.9.30.4 GR21 relative rule c)
      *> selects the record "greater than the file position indicator if
      *> NEXT is specified or implied or is less than the file position
      *> indicator if PREVIOUS is specified", so GR10 a) has to hold for
      *> a READ PREVIOUS as well.  The relative pair is reopened (which
      *> resets both indicators, §14.9.27.4 GR14); B walks forward to
      *> the third record, A then locks the SECOND with two
      *> READ ... WITH LOCK - single record locking releases the first
      *> (§12.4.5.9.4 GR6) so A holds exactly that one - and B's
      *> READ PREVIOUS is refused '51'.  After the UNLOCK the SAME
      *> statement delivers the SECOND record, because B's indicator is
      *> still on the third.  Were the refused read to have moved it,
      *> the second PREVIOUS would deliver the FIRST record instead.
