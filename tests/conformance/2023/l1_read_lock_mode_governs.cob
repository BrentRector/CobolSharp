      *> ISO §14.9.30.4 GR7 — "Whether record locking is in effect is
      *> determined by the rules specified in 12.4.5.9, LOCK MODE
      *> clause."  A pure delegation rule: the only thing it can be
      *> observed to do is make the READ's locking behaviour follow the
      *> file control entry, so the two legs below differ in NOTHING
      *> but the presence of the LOCK MODE clause.
      *> 12.4.5.9 GR1 a) "If the LOCK MODE clause is omitted from a file
      *>   control entry, ... If there is a SHARING clause in that file
      *>   control entry, no record locks are set by the execution of
      *>   I-O statements through the associated file connector."
      *> 12.4.5.9 GR4 "If the AUTOMATIC phrase is specified, the lock
      *>   mode is automatic.  Records are locked when any READ
      *>   statement is executed."
      *>
      *> LEG 1 (F1/F2, SHARING but no LOCK MODE).  F1 reads record 1
      *> WITH LOCK — §14.9.30.3 SR4 permits the phrase precisely because
      *> automatic locking was NOT specified — and GR1a means no lock is
      *> set, so F2 reads the same record successfully ('00').
      *> ⛔ WHY "READ ONLY" AND NOT "ALL OTHER" ON LEG 1 — DO NOT
      *> "SIMPLIFY" THESE TWO SELECTS TO MATCH F3/F4.  §14.9.27.3 SR8:
      *>   "When file-name-1 is not subject to an APPLY COMMIT clause,
      *>   then if the sharing phrase is omitted from the OPEN statement
      *>   and the ALL phrase is specified in the SHARING clause of the
      *>   file control entry for file-name-1 or if the ALL phrase is
      *>   specified on the OPEN statement, the LOCK MODE clause shall
      *>   be specified in the file control entry for file-name-1."
      *> LEG 1's whole point is a file control entry with NO LOCK MODE
      *> clause, so the ALL phrase is not available to it: SHARING WITH
      *> ALL OTHER here is non-conforming source and is rejected at the
      *> SELECT itself, before any OPEN is looked at (COBOLNET1512,
      *> DataBinder; see tests/conformance/negative/
      *> sharing-all-no-lockmode.cob, which carries no OPEN at all).
      *> Nor can an OPEN … SHARING WITH READ ONLY phrase rescue it —
      *> §14.9.27.4 GR23 lets the phrase override the clause, but this
      *> build rejects the entry regardless.  SHARING WITH READ ONLY on
      *> the SELECT is therefore the only legal carrier, and it keeps
      *> every conjunct of the derivation — it is still "a SHARING
      *> clause in that file control entry" so §12.4.5.9.4 GR1a applies
      *> verbatim, §9.1.15 item 2 says of it "Record locks are in
      *> effect" and permits a second connector in INPUT mode (Table 19,
      *> read only/input × READ ONLY/INPUT = normal open) — and it does
      *> not name the ALL phrase, so SR8 never fires.  F3/F4 keep ALL
      *> OTHER legally: they carry LOCK MODE IS AUTOMATIC.
      *> LEG 2 (F3/F4, SHARING plus LOCK MODE IS AUTOMATIC).  F3's PLAIN
      *> read locks record 1 (GR4), so F4's read of it is refused with
      *> the record operation conflict status '51' (§14.9.30 GR9,
      *> §9.1.13.8) and no record is made available.
      *> R2='00' against R4='51' IS the delegation: identical
      *> statements, opposite outcomes, decided only by 12.4.5.9.
