      *> SELECTS one, and both selections are mandatory:
      *>   - no USAGE clause -> 13.18.60.3 SR13(b) implies USAGE DISPLAY, and GR7
      *>     makes DISPLAY "an alphanumeric coded character set" -> one character per

      *> data items within a record, when a SYNCHRONIZED clause is not specified, is
      *> at the first bit position of the first available byte." -> byte 3. It is the

      *> characters" -> 1 char. 15.50.4 r5 requires that filler be COUNTED. 3+1 = 4.
