      *> kb/Work PB173 - a GROUP-USAGE BIT group crossing the CALL boundary. 14.9.4.3 SR6 admits it: "If the BY
      *> REFERENCE phrase is specified or implied for an identifier-2 that is a bit data item, identifier-2 shall
      *> be described such that it is aligned on a byte boundary and that subscripting and the leftmost position
      *> in a reference modification of identifier-2 consist of only fixed-point numeric literals ..." - and
      *> 13.18.29.4 GR1a makes a bit group "a bit data item", while a level-01 entry is byte-aligned by
      *> construction. 14.2.3 GR8 then makes the formal occupy "the same storage area as the argument", so the
      *> carrier across the boundary is the group's STORAGE IMAGE and the callee's store shows through.
      *> ⛔ THE DEFECT THIS PINS: the read half rendered the group's OPERAND value (GR1b's m boolean positions,
      *> AsBits) while the write half distributed it through FromImage, which reads ceil(m/8) PACKED characters -
      *> two alphabets on one carrier. Measured before the fix: A0 crossed as 11001010 and the callee saw
      *> 00110001 (the eight bits of the character '1'), and the caller got 00110000 back.
      *> GB is TWELVE bits, so its packed image is two characters with four pad bits - the leg that catches a
      *> round trip that drops the partial trailing byte.
