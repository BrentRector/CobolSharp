      *> ISO §13.18.55.3 SR2 — "SYNC is an abbreviation for SYNCHRONIZED."
      *> The abbreviation is accepted EVERYWHERE the full word is, in every
      *> form of the clause, and produces the identical layout.
      *>
      *> THE RULE. §13.18.55.3 SR2: "SYNC is an abbreviation for
      *> SYNCHRONIZED." An abbreviation is not a second clause with similar
      *> behaviour — it is the SAME clause spelled shorter, so every place
      *> §13.18.55 reaches has to answer identically to both spellings, and
      *> nowhere may accept one and refuse the other.
      *>
      *> WHERE THE CLAUSE CAN BE WRITTEN, and therefore what this golden has
      *> to pair.
      *>   §13.18.55.3 SR1: "The SYNCHRONIZED clause may be specified for
      *>   group and elementary items." — so both an elementary entry and a
      *>   group entry, and a level-77 entry, which §8.5.1.3.2 GR3 makes an
      *>   elementary item ("Entries that specify noncontiguous data items
      *>   that are not subdivisions of other items, and are not themselves
      *>   subdivided, have been assigned the special level-number 77").
      *>   §13.18.55.2's general format offers the optional LEFT / RIGHT
      *>   phrase, governed by GR4 and GR5 — so all three forms (bare, LEFT,
      *>   RIGHT) are written in both spellings.
      *> Group SYNCHRONIZED is a COBOL-2023 introduction, which is why the
      *> GROUP leg lives in the 2023 corpus; the companion witness
      *> negative/l1_sync_abbrev_group_below_2023 proves the ABBREVIATION
      *> reaches that same edition gate below 2023, which is the half a
      *> positive golden cannot show.
      *>
      *> THE NUMBERS, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT ARBITRARY.
      *> The absolute answers come from the §13.18.55.4 GR9 implementor
      *> determination, docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-195: COBOL.NET performs
      *> NO physical alignment for SYNCHRONIZED and generates NO implicit
      *> FILLER for it. Combined with DOC-A.1-205 (a BINARY/COMP item of 3-4
      *> digits occupies 2 bytes) and DOC-A.1-209 (USAGE DISPLAY is one byte
      *> per character position):
      *>   a PIC S9(4) COMP elementary item is 2 bytes — the L77 leg;
      *>   PIC X + PIC S9(4) COMP + PIC X is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 bytes — the ELEM,
      *>   LEFT, RIGHT and GROUP legs.
      *> SR2 itself is the EQUALITY of the two numbers on each line; the
      *> absolute value is what keeps the leg honest, since a pair that read
      *> "4 4" while the true answer was 3 would be two wrong answers in
      *> agreement.
      *>
      *> WHAT WOULD BREAK EACH LEG. If SYNC and SYNCHRONIZED were separate
      *> constructs, the failure would not be a different number — it would be
      *> a COMPILE error on whichever spelling one of the five positions did
      *> not accept, which is exactly what this golden's five position-pairs
      *> are for. The IMG leg then compares the two byte images directly:
      *> both groups hold "a", -1234 and "z", and §14.9.25.4 GR4 makes the
      *> group move to an alphanumeric item a byte transfer, so X1 = X2 is a
      *> comparison of the stored bytes, not of the described values.
