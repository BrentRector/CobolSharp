      *> ISO §13.18.52.4 GR4 / GR5 b) under the NON-DEFAULT over-punch convention — Annex A.1 items
      *> 177 and 178 (kb/Work PB803, owner decision 2026-09-09: "Keep both behind an option with the
      *> default being IBM and Micro Focus compatibility").
      *>
      *> ⛔ THIS GOLDEN COMPILES WITH AN OPTION, and the `*> options:` header on its first line is
      *> how it says so — the same place the negative corpus declares `*> reject-at:`, read by
      *> ConformanceCorpus.ApplySourceOptions.  Without the header this program compiles under the
      *> DEFAULT convention and every leg below is wrong, so the header is not decoration: it is the
      *> only thing that makes the option OBSERVABLE from the corpus, and its own failure mode is a
      *> loud one (an unknown key or value throws rather than falling back to the default).
      *>
      *> THE DETERMINATION PINNED HERE (docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-177 / -178, the `ascii` row).
      *> A POSITIVE digit is left alone and a NEGATIVE digit becomes digit + 0x40, so 0-9 fuse to
      *> "0123456789" positive and "pqrstuvwxy" negative.  This is GnuCOBOL's `-fsign=ascii`, its
      *> default on a PC host; the default `ibm` row of the same tables is pinned by
      *> conformance:2023/pb803_sign_default_representation.
      *>
      *> WHY EACH LEG CAN FAIL — expected values derived from the determination, not observed.
      *> NEG / LEAD / POS are the three images the two conventions DISAGREE on: under `ibm` they
      *>   would read `123M|`, `J234|` and `123D|`.  POS is the leg that is easy to get wrong in the
      *>   other direction -- under `ascii` a POSITIVE value is byte-identical to an unsigned one,
      *>   so an encoder that punched every sign would answer `1234|` only by accident and a decoder
      *>   that did not treat a plain digit as positive would lose the value.
      *> The `|` sentinel pins the width exactly as it does in the default golden: the fused sign
      *>   occupies a DIGIT position under every convention (§13.18.52.4 GR5 a), which is normative
      *>   and not part of the latitude), so PIC S9(4) is 4 characters here too.
      *> The class legs pin GR5 b)'s valid set for THIS convention, and the last two are the point:
      *>   `12C` and `12{` are valid signs under `ibm` and are NOT valid signs here.  A predicate
      *>   that answered from a fixed table would report them NUMERIC and the option would be a
      *>   half-measure that changed the encoder and not the class condition.
      *> `12p` / `12y` are the two ends of the negative run (digit 0 and digit 9), so the leg fails
      *>   if the table is off by one at either end.
