      *> PB59 / RV-15.12.4-1, RV-15.18.4-1 — a numeric literal is a LEGAL string-channel argument for
      *> exactly the functions whose §15.x.3 rules admit one, and it renders as its own characters.
      *> §15.18.3 r1 lists class NUMERIC among CONCAT's argument classes and §15.18.4 r1 concatenates
      *> "all of the characters"; §15.12.3 r1 admits "an unsigned integer ... literal" as BASECONVERT
      *> argument-1 below base 11. Both shapes used to compile CLEAN and abort at RUN TIME with
      *> NotImplementedCobolFeatureException (the wrong-stage family): the renderer's string channel
      *> had no numeric-literal arm, pinned as designed by a drift test — the pin moved WITH the fix.
      *> The folded nested numeric function (FUNCTION LENGTH of a fixed item folds to a numeric
      *> literal at bind) reaches the same arm. The admission is PER-FUNCTION: NUMVAL and friends
      *> still refuse a numeric literal (their §15.67.3/§15.69.3 rules exclude it).
