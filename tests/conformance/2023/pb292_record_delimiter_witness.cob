      *> ISO 12.4.5.11 RECORD DELIMITER clause - THE INERTNESS HALF of the
      *> kb/Work PB292 witness. The DECLINE half (COBOLNET1778 on both
      *> arms, every edition) cannot be asserted by a positive golden,
      *> because the corpus never reads the warning channel; it is pinned
      *> by conformance-test DocumentedNonSupportWitnessTests over THIS
      *> SAME source file, so both halves have one source of truth.
      *> WHAT THIS PROGRAM PROVES, AND WHY THE .OUT IS SPEC-DERIVED.
      *> The clause is declined whole: STANDARD-1 is Annex A.3 item 26
      *> ("The STANDARD-1 phrase of the RECORD DELIMITER clause is
      *> dependent upon a reel type of device") and 12.4.5.11.4 GR2 makes
      *> its medium a tape drive, which this implementation has none of;
      *> feature-name-1 names nothing because 12.4.5.11.3 SR2 leaves the
      *> available names to the implementor and this implementation
      *> specifies NONE (Annex A.1 item 150 is optional -
      *> docs/CONFORMANCE.md section 7). So 12.4.5.11.4 GR5 governs
      *> instead: "If the RECORD DELIMITER clause is not specified, the
      *> method used for determining the length of a variable-length
      *> record is specified by the implementor" - the 4-byte
      *> little-endian length prefix of Annex A.1 item 151.
      *> 12.4.5.11.4 GR1 is what makes the decline INERT rather than a
      *> wrong answer: "Any method used shall not be reflected in the
      *> record area or the record size used within the function, method,
      *> or program." So the lengths read back are the lengths written,
      *> whichever arm was written - and, the point of file D, whether or
      *> not the clause was written at all. That is the whole prediction.
      *> The lengths themselves come from 13.18.43.4 GR15: "after the
      *> successful execution of a READ or RETURN statement for the file,
      *> the contents of the data item referenced by data-name-1 will
      *> indicate the number of bytes in the record just read." Records
      *> of 3 and 8 bytes are written, so 03 and 08 are read back.
      *> THE FOUR FILES COVER THE GENERAL FORMAT AND GR5's ANTECEDENT.
      *> 12.4.5.11.2 is a plain required choice - on the printed page
      *> RECORD, DELIMITER and STANDARD-1 are underlined and IS is not -
      *> so the legal spellings are exactly: STANDARD-1 or feature-name-1,
      *> each with or without IS. A writes the STANDARD-1 arm with IS, B
      *> the feature-name arm with IS, C the STANDARD-1 arm with the
      *> optional word OMITTED. D writes NO clause at all, which is the
      *> only condition under which 12.4.5.11.4 GR5 speaks, and reads
      *> back identically - which is what "declined whole" means.
      *> All four files are 12.4.5.11.3 SR1-legal - "The RECORD DELIMITER
      *> clause may be specified only for variable-length records" - via
      *> the RECORD IS VARYING clause, SR1's own second NOTE case. The
      *> reference modification F1-REC(1:WS-LEN1) shows exactly the record
      *> and nothing of the area beyond it, so the prediction never
      *> depends on what a short READ leaves in the tail of the area.
