      *> ISO 14.9.6.4 GR10 - a multi-file CLOSE is N separate CLOSE
      *> statements in written order, and a declarative's RESUME NEXT
      *> STATEMENT resumes at the NEXT implicit CLOSE.
      *> Sentence 1 is pinned twice. (i) CLOSE F1 F2 F3 with F2 never
      *> opened: each file-name gets its OWN I-O status update -
      *> 00 / 42 / 00 - because GR1 makes only the F2 leg unsuccessful
      *> ("If the file connector is not open, the CLOSE statement is
      *> unsuccessful and the I-O status indicator for the file
      *> connector is set to '42'"), and F1 and F3 really were closed,
      *> proven by re-OPENing them ('00', not the already-open '41').
      *> (ii) CLOSE F1 F1 names ONE file twice: written as two separate
      *> statements the first is '00' and the second finds the connector
      *> no longer open, '42' - the order-sensitive form.
      *> Sentence 2: a USE AFTER STANDARD ERROR declarative fires on the
      *> SECOND of the three implicit CLOSEs and executes RESUME AT NEXT
      *> STATEMENT (AT is an optional word, 14.9.33.2); processing must
      *> resume at the THIRD implicit CLOSE, so F3 closes ('00' plus the
      *> successful re-OPEN) instead of control leaving the statement.
