      *> kb/Work PB157 - COMPUTE Format 2 over the bit-group model.
      *> 14.9.8.3 SR2 wants an ELEMENTARY boolean receiver and
      *> 13.18.29.4 GR1b makes a GROUP-USAGE BIT group exactly that
      *> (as-if PICTURE 1(m)) - the binder's raw-Pic readers REJECTED it
      *> while the sending side of the same statement accepted it.
      *> Legs: H1 - F2 direct with a bit-group receiver AND operand
      *> (GR3 width = max item positions = 6); HZ - bare figurative
      *> ZERO with a boolean receiver is LEGAL (8.8.2 lists ZERO and
      *> the ALL literal as DISJOINT operands; only the Format-6
      *> ALL B"..." falls under SR3's ban - this rejected before);
      *> H2 - the F1->F2 reroute on a sole bit-group reference; M1/M2 -
      *> multi-target Format 2 with END-COMPUTE (never once written);
      *> B3/B8 - a 6-position value truncates right into 1(3) and
      *> zero-fills into 1(8) per 14.6.8.6; W8 - the DISCRIMINATING
      *> mixed-width leg: A3 right-zero-extends to 6 (8.8.2 rule 9),
      *> the GR3 width is the LARGEST ITEM (6, the bit group) - a
      *> Gr3Width that counted the group as 0 resized to 3 and answered
      *> 11000000; AZ - ALL ZERO is Format 1's OPTIONAL-ALL figurative
      *> ZERO (8.3.3.6.2), never the ALL literal; NZ - B-NOT ZERO folds
      *> positionless all-ones and replicates to the receiver width
      *> (8.3.3.6.4 GR2); ZB - ZERO as ONE operand of a binary op is
      *> legal (8.8.2 rule 4 bars only BOTH being ALL literals).
