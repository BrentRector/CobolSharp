      *> ISO §14.9.27.4 GR17 — "If the file is not present, and the
      *> EXTEND or I-O phrase is specified in the OPEN statement, and
      *> the OPTIONAL clause is specified in the file control entry for
      *> file-name-1, the OPEN statement creates the file. This
      *> creation takes place as if the following statements were
      *> executed in the order shown: OPEN OUTPUT file-name-1. CLOSE
      *> file-name-1. These statements are followed by execution of the
      *> OPEN statement specified in the source element and the I-O
      *> status value associated with file-name-1 is set to '05'."
      *> (The clause's last three characters are an OCR artifact in the
      *> transcription; §9.1.13.2 item 4a supplies the value outright —
      *> "If the open mode is I-O or extend, the physical file has been
      *> created".)
      *> The rule has SIX arms — three organizations x {EXTEND, I-O} —
      *> and all six are exercised, none inferred from another.
      *> Per arm, all three lines are stated by the rule:
      *>   -OPEN   '05' (§9.1.13.2 item 4a).
      *>   -REOPEN a plain OPEN INPUT of the same file-name now reports
      *>           '00'. §9.1.13.2 item 4a's '05' is defined by "the
      *>           physical file is not present"; a '00' here is only
      *>           possible because the earlier OPEN CREATED the file.
      *>           This is the line that separates GR17 from GR13,
      *>           where the INPUT phrase creates nothing.
      *>   -READ   '10'. The creation is "as if OPEN OUTPUT … CLOSE",
      *>           and §14.9.27.4 GR18 says that leaves a file which
      *>           "contains no records" — so the first sequential READ
      *>           is the at end condition (§9.1.13.4 item 1a).
      *> §14.9.27.3 SR2 confines EXTEND to sequential access mode, so
      *> the keyed connectors below are ACCESS SEQUENTIAL.
