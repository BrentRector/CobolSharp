      *> GR3 b): "When the USING phrase of the ASSIGN clause is specified, the file connector referenced by
      *> file-name-1 is associated with a physical file identified by the content of the data item referenced by
      *> data-name-1 in the runtime element that executes the OPEN, SORT, or MERGE statement." GR3's lead sentence
      *> fixes the timing: "The association occurs at the time of execution of an OPEN, SORT, or MERGE statement
      *> that referenced file-name-1." So ONE connector reaches TWO physical files in one run unit, and the file
      *> named by the file-name (dynf.txt) is never written at all - the CHK connector proves it (kb/Work PB324).
