      *> the sending operand FOUR TIMES - addOperand / subtractOperand /
      *> multiplyOperand / divideOperand, each `dataReference | literal` - and all
      *> four omitted functionCall, while COMPUTE accepted it because its RHS is an
      *> arithmeticExpression. One rule written down four times, wrong in all four.

      *> bound the ARGUMENT - `ADD FUNCTION SQRT(W-Z) TO W-R` with W-Z = 4 added
      *> FOUR instead of TWO. It compiled and printed a plausible number. Only
