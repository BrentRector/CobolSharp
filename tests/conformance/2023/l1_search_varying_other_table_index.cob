      *> indexes specified in the INDEXED phrase in the OCCURS clause
      *> associated with identifier-1, the search index is the same as
      *> in General rule 3a. The index referenced by index-name-1 is
      *> incremented by one occurrence number at the same time as the
      *> search index is incremented." Plus GR3's closing sentence,
      *> "All other indexes associated with identifier-1 are unchanged".
      *> WS-E is INDEXED BY IX1 IX2 and holds 1..5; WS-F is a different
      *> table INDEXED BY JX. IX1 starts at 1, IX2 at 5, JX at 3, and
      *> the statement is SEARCH WS-E VARYING JX.
      *>   IX1 = 4  — the search index is still GR3a's first index-name
      *>              and GR1a leaves it at the matching occurrence.
      *>   JX  = 6  — three unsuccessful passes, three occurrence
      *>              numbers: 3 + 3. §13.18.38.4 GR2 guarantees an

      *>              so 6 is inside the required range of a 5-element
      *>              table's index.
      *>   IX2 = 5  — an index of identifier-1 that was not indicated.
