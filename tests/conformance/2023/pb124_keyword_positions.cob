      *> kb/Work PB124 (AR-15.3-7 / FMT-15.96.2) — the intrinsic phrase keywords bind POSITIONALLY, and a
      *> word in a non-keyword position is the user's own name. ISO 15.50.2: LENGTH(argument-1 [PHYSICAL]) —
      *> PHYSICAL is not a reserved word (8.10 has no row), so a data item NAMED PHYSICAL is legal and
      *> LENGTH(PHYSICAL) measures IT (3 here); the old unordered swallow consumed the name as the keyword
      *> and degraded the call to zero arguments. LENGTH(WS-G PHYSICAL) is the keyword form (10 — this
      *> implementation's PHYSICAL is transparent, 15.50.4 r8 determination). ISO 15.96.2 places TRIM's
      *> [LEADING|TRAILING] AFTER argument-1 (the figure notes: a plain bracket between argument-1 and the
      *> repeated argument-2). ISO 15.87.2 places [ANYCASE] [FIRST|LAST] before each SUBSTITUTE pair in that
      *> order: "aAa" with ANYCASE FIRST "a"->"z" replaces only the FIRST case-insensitive match: "zAa".
