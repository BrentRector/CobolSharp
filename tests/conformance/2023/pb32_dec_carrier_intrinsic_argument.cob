      *> MaxScaled(params Int128[]) as a raw CobolDec, which has no conversion operator. The user saw the

      *>       error CS1503: Argument 1: cannot convert from 'CobolNet.Runtime.CobolDec' to 'System.Int128'
      *> That is the PB2 shape on the Dec axis: an INTERNAL failure escaping as a backend error, phrased in C#
