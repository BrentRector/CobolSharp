      *> kb/Work PB135 - the OO environment plumbing whole. (1) 10.6.1 prints [options-paragraph] in
      *> every skeleton: the CLASS-level OPTIONS DEFAULT ROUNDED MODE NEAREST-EVEN reaches M1's bare
      *> ROUNDED (COMPUTE 5/2 -> 2, nearest-even; the old grammar made the paragraph a bare parse error),
      *> and M2's OWN paragraph overrides per 11.9.4 GR1 for ITS body only (5/2 -> 3, nearest-away) with
      *> no leak back. (2) The class SPECIAL-NAMES device mnemonic (SYSOUT IS MYCONSOLE) resolves inside
      *> a method - the old MnemonicRegistry walk never met the class configuration (COBOLNET0817 on
      *> legal source) while the SWITCH map from the SAME rule resolved. Derived: CLS-EVEN=0002,
      *> MTH-AWAY=0003.
