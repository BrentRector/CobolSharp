      *> ISO §13.18.60.4 GR7 — USAGE DISPLAY: size and representation of characters
      *> (Annex A.1 item 209).
      *>
      *> THE RULE. §13.18.60.4 GR7: "The implicit or explicit USAGE DISPLAY clause specifies
      *> that an alphanumeric coded character set shall be used to represent a data item in
      *> the storage of the computer, and that the data item is aligned on a character
      *> boundary. Alphanumeric characters shall be represented in the storage of the computer
      *> as characters of uniform size equal to or less than the size of characters in the
      *> computer's national character set. Each implementor shall specify the size and
      *> representation of characters stored for usage DISPLAY."
      *>
      *> Three testable obligations, and the implementor determination is ONE BYTE per
      *> character position:
      *> UNI  - "characters of UNIFORM size": the byte count is exactly n x s for a PIC X(n),
      *>        with the same s at every n. 1, 5, 9 for X(1), X(5), X(9) is s = 1 measured
      *>        three times; a non-uniform representation (a variable-width external encoding,
      *>        say) would not scale linearly.
      *> LEQN - "equal to or LESS THAN the size of characters in the computer's national
      *>        character set": the national determination is 2 bytes per position (GR8's twin
      *>        obligation, UTF-16 code units), so 1 <= 2 satisfies GR7. This leg is the one
      *>        that makes the DISPLAY size a CONSTRAINED choice and not a free one — it fails
      *>        for any DISPLAY size above the national size.
      *> POS  - the size of a character IS one byte, stated as the identity of the two length
      *>        functions on the same item: FUNCTION LENGTH counts alphanumeric character
      *>        POSITIONS (§15.50.4 r3) and FUNCTION BYTE-LENGTH counts BYTES (§15.14.1), and
      *>        they agree at 5 only because one position occupies one byte.
      *> ALIGN- "the data item is aligned on a character boundary": X(1) + X(3) + X(1) is
      *>        1 + 3 + 1 = 5 with no implicit FILLER anywhere — a character boundary is every
      *>        byte, so nothing is ever skipped to reach one.
      *> NUM  - the representation of a NUMERIC display item, which is USAGE DISPLAY by
      *>        implication (§13.18.60.3 SR13 b: "otherwise, a USAGE DISPLAY clause is
      *>        implied"): one character position, hence one byte, per digit position. 9(5) is
      *>        5. S9(5) with no SIGN clause is ALSO 5, because §13.18.52.4 GR5 a puts the
      *>        operational sign "associated with the leading (or, respectively, trailing)
      *>        digit position" — an existing position, not a new one. S9(5) SIGN IS TRAILING
      *>        SEPARATE is 6, because §13.18.52.4 GR6 a makes the sign "the leading (or,
      *>        respectively, trailing) character position ... this character position is not
      *>        a digit position". The three answers 5 / 5 / 6 are the whole GR7 x SIGN grid.
