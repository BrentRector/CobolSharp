      *> kb/Work PB178. FUNCTION CONVERT's ANY source format over a Tier-B REDEFINES group VIEW.
      *>
      *> §15.19.3 r7: "When the source-format is ANY, argument-1 shall be of any usage, except index,
      *> message-tag, object reference, pointer, function-pointer or program-pointer. It is not necessary for
      *> the contents to be valid according to the usage" — the exclusion list is keyed on USAGE and names only
      *> the address/index shapes, so a GROUP is legal argument-1 and r7 asks for its RAW STORAGE.
      *> §13.18.44.4 GR1: "Storage association for the subject of the entry starts at the first bit of the data
      *> item referenced by data-name-2 and continues over an area sufficient to contain the number of bits
      *> required by the data item referenced by the subject of the entry" — a REDEFINES view IS the same
      *> storage, so its raw-storage image is the redefined item's bytes, never a second encoding.
      *>
      *> THE DEFECT: OperandText.AsStorageImage's group arm spelled `{Read(p)}.AsImage()` itself and had no
      *> RedefViewPlace arm, while a Tier-B view's Read() is ALREADY the (offset, width) character window — so it
      *> emitted `CobolStr.RefMod(_redef_A, 1, 8).AsImage()`, a backend CS1061 on `string`. The PB176 capability
      *> guard did not help: it is the WRONG AXIS — the shape IS image-capable; the READ is already a window.
      *> The fix routes it through PlaceRenderer.SendingGroupImage, THE ONE reader, whose doc-comment already
      *> stated the law ("a consumer that spells .AsImage() itself is wrong for the window shape").
