      *> ISO §15.40.3 r3 - "Argument-2 shall be a value in integer date
      *> form." §15.5.2 IS that form: "A value in integer date form is a
      *> positive integer that represents a number of days succeeding
      *> December 31, 1600, in the Gregorian calendar. It shall be greater
      *> than zero and shall be less than or equal to the value of FUNCTION
      *> INTEGER-OF-DATE (99991231), which is 3,067,671."
      *>
      *> So the admissible interval is [1, 3067671] and BOTH ends are legal
      *> values, not merely non-errors. Outside it §15.3 rule 14 applies -
      *> "If the evaluation of an argument results in an incorrect value for
      *> that argument ... the EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION exception condition is
      *> set to exist" - which is what the declarative below observes. The
      *> RESULT on a violating leg is NOT asserted: rule 14's last sentence
      *> makes it implementor-defined when checking is not enabled, so only
      *> the exception is a spec-derived expectation.
      *>
      *> A LOCAL combined format is used throughout so that r3's own screen
      *> is what is measured: the §15.40.4 r2 UTC roll can also carry a date
      *> out of the form, and that interaction is r25_utc_roll_date_range's.
      *>
      *> Derivation of the two legal values (§15.5.2's epoch, integer date
      *> 1 = 1601-01-01): 1 renders 16010101 and 3067671 renders 99991231,
      *> which is the clause's own stated maximum. §15.5.5: 45296 seconds
      *> past midnight is 12:34:56.
