      *> ISO 8.3.2.1: "Each character of a COBOL word ... shall be selected from
      *> the set of basic letters, basic digits, extended letters, and the basic
      *> special characters HYPHEN AND UNDERSCORE. The hyphen or underscore shall
      *> not appear as the first or last character in such words."
      *>
      *> The underscore is a COBOL-2002 introduction (the '85 word character set
      *> is hyphen-only), so `01 MY_NAME PIC X(6).` is legal at three of the four
      *> editions this compiler targets - and it did not parse at ANY of them
      *> (fix-queue R02). It died as `no viable alternative at input 'MY_'`, which
      *> is an unexplained rejection rather than a named edition diagnostic; the
      *> COBOL-85 rejection is now the construct gate user-word-underscore-2002
      *> (COBOLNET0900), pinned by the version matrix.
      *>
      *> WATCH THE SECOND HALF OF THAT SENTENCE. "nor last" held only in the
      *> ALPHA-start lexer alternative; the two DIGIT-start alternatives ended in
      *> a `*` over the separator class, so `1A-` and `42-X-` were ACCEPTED - a
      *> pre-existing hole for the HYPHEN that the underscore would have silently
      *> inherited. Both are rejected now (negative fixture
      *> r02-word-trailing-separator), which is why this golden asserts the legal
      *> digit-start shapes explicitly: they are what that fix must not break.
