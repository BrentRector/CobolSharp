      *> kb/Work PB391. The 2002-and-later halves of ISO 1989:2023 14.7.6's CORRESPONDING rules, which the
      *> COBOL-85 fixture (85/pb391_corresponding_rule2_table16_85) cannot express.
      *>
      *> RULE 2 - "the resulting move is valid according to the rules for the MOVE statement" - over the
      *> categories 14.9.25.3 table 16 adds beyond the '85 set, read AS PRINTED:
      *>   National           -> National, National-edited        = Yes  NA2 becomes XYZ
      *>   Boolean            -> Boolean                          = Yes  BO2 becomes 1010
      *>   Numeric/Integer    -> Boolean                          = No   NB2 keeps 0000
      *>   Numeric/Noninteger -> National, National-edited        = No   NV2 keeps QQQ
      *> A refused pair is a SILENT non-selection, so the receiver keeps its prior content; MM proves the
      *> statement ran. 14.9.25.4 GR11 NOTE 5 is why the elementary national and boolean children are reached
      *> at all: "bit group items and national group items are processed as group items", so the binder
      *> descends into them and pairs their elementary members.
      *>
      *> RULE 4 - "Neither data item contains an OCCURS, REDEFINES, or RENAMES clause or is of class index,
      *> message-tag, object, or pointer." K is class pointer in both groups, so the namesake pair is NOT a
      *> corresponding pair and PK stays NULL while the alphanumeric sibling MP moves. Table 16 has no pointer
      *> row or column and therefore ADMITS a pointer x pointer pair - rule 4 is the only thing refusing it,
      *> which is exactly what CorrespondingRule2DriftTests pins. 13.18.60.3 SR14 is why the pointer sits
      *> under a STRONG type declaration: that is the one spelling legal below level 1.
      *>
      *> Before PB391 the binder answered rule 2 from a second, private, partial copy of table 16 whose sender
      *> switch ended `_ => false` and whose receiver axis was one boolean: NA2 and BO2 were silently DROPPED,
      *> NB2 read 1010 and NV2 read 035 - and the pointer pair was excluded only by that same `_ => false`
      *> accident, so deleting the copy without rule 4 would have copied a pointer silently.
