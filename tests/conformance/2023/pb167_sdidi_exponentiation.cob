      *> kb/Work PB167 - owner decision D-C (2026-08-30): FUND the SDIDI exponentiation development.
      *> 8.8.1.5.4 r2e leaves the equivalent arithmetic expression for a non-integer exponent to the
      *> implementor but binds the DEVELOPMENT - "Operands used in the development of that value shall be in
      *> SDIDI form.  All additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions performed in the development
      *> of the result shall be performed in accordance with the corresponding rules in ISO/IEC 60559:2020."
      *> The development is now exp(operand-2 x ln operand-1) carried entirely on CobolDec (decimal128)
      *> operations - no binary64 bridge anywhere - with ONE special case:
      *>
      *>   |operand-2| = 1/2  ->  FUNCTION SQRT(operand-1), and r3's 1/(operand-1 ** 1/2) at -1/2.
      *>
      *> SQRT is the one 15 function whose standard-decimal returned value the standard fixes EXACTLY
      *> (15.84.4 r2: "the absolute value of the exact square root of argument-1 rounded to 34 digits
      *> according to the rules for standard-decimal arithmetic"), so choosing it as the r2e equivalent
      *> expression makes b ** 0.5 and FUNCTION SQRT(b) equal BY CONSTRUCTION - 15.4.1 r1 consistency
      *> rather than luck.  Before D-C both were binary64 approximations and the two DISAGREED.
      *>
      *> The pinned digits: the SQRT lines are the spec-exact value (15.84.4 r2), truncated by the receiver
      *> (14.7.4 - no ROUNDED phrase).  The transcendental lines show 21 significant digits of the true value;
      *> the development carries more than that but 8.8.1.5.2's 34-digit per-operation rounding means an
      *> r2e development can never promise all 34, so the goldens deliberately stop short of the last digits
      *> (CONFORMANCE.md 7 records the determination in those terms).
      *>
      *> r3 (a NEGATIVE operand-2) is NOT implementor latitude - r2's latitude is scoped "When the value of
      *> operand-2 is greater than zero", and r3 fixes the outer expression as a DIVISION:
      *>
      *>   operand-2 < 0  ->  (1 / (operand-1 ** FUNCTION ABS (operand-2)))
      *>
      *> The reciprocal is now written ONCE, in CobolDec.Pow, over |operand-2| - so every arm below it is
      *> r3-correct by construction rather than by which arm the operands happened to reach.
