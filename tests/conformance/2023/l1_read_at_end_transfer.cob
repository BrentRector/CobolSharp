      *> a) "The I-O status ... is set to '10' to indicate the at end
      *>    condition" (the EC half of a) is pinned by the companion
      *>    golden l1_read_at_end_ec).
      *> c) "If the AT END phrase is specified in the READ statement
      *>    causing the condition, control is transferred to
      *>    imperative-statement-1.  Any other applicable exception
      *>    processing statements are not executed."
      *> d) "If the AT END phrase is not specified in the input-output
      *>    statement, any applicable at end exception processing
      *>    statements are executed."
      *> A USE AFTER STANDARD ERROR declarative per file stands in for
      *> "exception processing statements" (§9.1.12 item 2); its DISPLAY
      *> is the observable for whether they ran.
      *>
      *> LEG A (file F, AT END written).  A2 is the at end read: the
      *> imperative runs ("A2-ATEND=10", GR24 c first sentence) and NO
      *> "DF=" line may appear (c second sentence).  A3 proves that
      *> silence is meaningful rather than a dead declarative: the READ
      *> after an unsuccessful one is '46' (GR21 first sentence), which
      *> is NOT the at end family, so the AT END phrase does not cover
      *> it and the SAME declarative fires — "DF=46" with no
      *> "A3-ATEND".  A3 is also GR24 b)'s only observable: the file
      *> position indicator now designates no next or previous logical
      *> record, and the following sequential READ is unsuccessful.
      *> LEG B (file G, no AT END phrase).  B2 is the at end read: the
      *> declarative runs — "DG=10" — per GR24 d).
