      *> ISO §14.9.28.3 SR9 — "At least six AFTER phrases shall be
      *> permitted in varying-phrase."
      *>
      *> A MINIMUM-CAPACITY rule: the only way to discharge it is to
      *> write the sixth AFTER phrase and run it. But "it parses" is
      *> not what the rule buys — a sixth AFTER that parsed and then
      *> nested or reset wrongly would satisfy a parse-only witness and
      *> still be broken, so this program asserts the SEQUENCE that
      *> §14.9.28.4 GR13 e) prescribes for seven levels.
      *>
      *> Seven induction variables, each FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL x > 2, so
      *> each admits exactly the values 1 and 2:
      *>
      *>   COUNT — GR13 e) runs the body once per combination of the
      *>   admitted values (step 2's "otherwise b." is the only arm
      *>   that executes it), so 2 ** 7 = 128.
      *>
      *>   SNAP2 — the tuple at the SECOND body execution. GR13 e) 2.
      *>   "otherwise b." increments the induction variable associated
      *>   with the CURRENT condition, and the current condition at the
      *>   moment the body runs is always the rightmost, so the seventh
      *>   variable is the one that varies fastest: 1111112, not
      *>   2111111. This is what a wrongly-NESTED seventh level breaks.
      *>
      *>   FINAL — the values left behind, derived by walking GR13 e)
      *>   2.'s true-branch on the last unwind: I7 reaches 3, so a. sets
      *>   it to its initialization value 1, b. makes condition-6
      *>   current and c. increments I6 to 3; the same three steps then
      *>   repeat leftwards until d. reaches condition-1, which is
      *>   incremented to 3 and, being condition-1, sends execution to
      *>   step 1, where 3 > 2 transfers control to the end. So the
      *>   first variable is left at 3 and every other at its
      *>   initialization value 1: 3111111. This is what a missing
      *>   RESET of an inner level breaks.
      *>
      *> The rule is worded identically in COBOL-85/2002/2014/2023.
