      *> kb/Work PB288 - ISO 14.2.3 GR9/GR10: a CALL argument crossing to a NUMERIC formal
      *> parameter IS "a COMPUTE statement without the ROUNDED phrase" whose receiving operand is
      *> a data item of the FORMAL's own description (GR9's NESTED/prototyped branch allocates
      *> exactly that record; GR10's BY VALUE record is the same shape), and GR11 resolves every
      *> reference to the formal through that same linkage description. So a magnitude the formal
      *> cannot hold is 14.7.5 case 3 - "after radix point alignment ... further from zero than
      *> permitted for the associated resultant data item" - whose no-SIZE-ERROR-phrase disposition
      *> with EC-SIZE checking off is documented in CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-70: execution continues
      *> and the receiver takes the LOW-ORDER digits of the result aligned at its scale. It is
      *> never the two's complement of an Int128 intermediate, which is not any rule.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED:
      *>  REF/VAL rows 1-3 - the argument is 10**30 (14.8.2 admits the 31-digit literal; 8.3.3.3.2
      *>    requires 1 through 31 digits). The formal is PIC S9(9)V9(9), so the result aligned at
      *>    scale 9 is 10**39 and the receiver's 18 digit positions keep its low-order 18, all of
      *>    them zero => +000000000.000000000. The fixed-point and floating spellings denote the
      *>    same value and MUST AGREE; BY VALUE (GR10) and BY CONTENT (GR9) MUST AGREE too - they
      *>    are the same COMPUTE into the same description.
      *>  REF/VAL rows 4-5 - the binary64 lane. F holds the double nearest 10**30, whose exact
      *>    value is 1000000000000000019884624838656; at scale 9 that is
      *>    1000000000000000019884624838656000000000 and the low-order 18 digits are
      *>    624838656000000000 => +624838656.000000000. The two arms MUST AGREE.
      *>  SML - 123456789012345678 into PIC S9(4)V99: aligned at scale 2 that is
      *>    12345678901234567800, low-order 6 digits 567800 => +5678.00.
      *>  MOV/CMP - the inline comparators. GR9 names a COMPUTE, and 14.9.25.4 GR6's MOVE keeps the
      *>    same low-order digits here, so all three rows MUST print the same characters. This is
      *>    the one-rule assertion: the crossing is not a second, weaker store rule.
      *>  Last REF - the control. 123.456 fits the formal, so the landing is exact and NOT a
      *>    blanket zero => +000000123.456000000.
