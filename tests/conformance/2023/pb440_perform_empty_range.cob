      *> kb/Work PB440 - PERFORM of an EMPTY procedure range. A section with ZERO paragraphs is legal:
      *> ISO 14.4.2 - "A section consists of a section header followed by zero, one, or more successive
      *> paragraphs". It makes 14.9.28.4 GR4's SPECIFIED SET OF STATEMENTS empty, and an empty set is a set.
      *>
      *> Two arms of one root cause were wrong and each is measured below.
      *>   ARM A - the binder returned a no-op for `start > end`, DELETING the whole control phrase with the
      *>           body, so GR13 a) never ran: the induction variables kept whatever a preceding MOVE left
      *>           in them and no condition of any level was ever evaluated.
      *>   ARM B - with THRU written that test was skipped and the dispatcher was handed the inverted pair
      *>           (start, start-1). Its return test (`__atExit && __pc == __exitPc + 1`) can never fire on
      *>           such a pair, so it ran from the range start to the END OF THE PC SPACE - the FOLLOWING
      *>           sections' statements, once per iteration of the control phrase.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE SPEC AND NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>
      *> 14.9.28.4 GR4 - "An inline PERFORM statement and an out-of-line PERFORM statement function
      *>   identically according to the following rules." The first two lines are the SAME control phrase
      *>   written both ways over the same (empty) body, so they shall agree digit for digit.
      *> 14.9.28.4 GR13 a) - "All induction variables are set to their associated initialization values in
      *>   the left-to-right order in which the induction variables are specified" => A=1, B=1 BEFORE any
      *>   transfer of control. VALUE 7 is therefore erased whatever the body does.
      *> 14.9.28.4 GR13 e) - condition-1 (A > 3) is evaluated first; while it is false the AFTER condition
      *>   (B > 3) is the current one, and each time IT goes true its induction variable is RESET to its
      *>   initialization value and the variable to its left is augmented. So B walks 1,2,3 then resets to 1
      *>   while A becomes 2 ... and the statement ends when A reaches 4 with B just reset:
      *>       A=4 B=1, and identically C=4 D=1.
      *> 14.9.28.4 GR5 - "control is transferred to the first statement of the specified set of statements":
      *>   an EMPTY set has no first statement, so NO transfer takes place and TAIL-SEC never runs. Every
      *>   N below is therefore 0 - PLAIN (GR8, the set executed once), THRUBASIC (GR8 over the empty THRU
      *>   composition), THRUTIMES (GR9, three iterations of nothing), THRUVAR (GR13 over the same set).
      *>   Before the fix these read N=1, N=3 and nine executions of TAIL-SEC respectively.
      *> 14.9.28.4 GR10 - "If the condition is true when the PERFORM statement is entered, and the TEST
      *>   BEFORE phrase is specified or implied, no transfer to the specified set of statements takes
      *>   place": ZEROTRIP's condition N = 0 holds on entry, so the statement is a zero-trip loop => N=0.
