      *> THE RULES.
      *>   f) "When the UCS-4 phrase is specified, the coded character set referenced shall be
      *>      as specified in ISO/IEC 10646 as UTF-32. Each character of UTF-32 is associated
      *>      with a corresponding character of the native national character set. The
      *>      implementor shall specify the correspondence between the characters of UTF-32
      *>      and the characters of the native national character set. ..."
      *>   g) "When the UTF-8 phrase is specified ... The association is the same as the
      *>      association for the UCS-32 character from which the UTF-8 character was
      *>      transformed."
      *>   h) "When the UTF-16 phrase is specified ... The association is the same as the
      *>      association for the UTF-32 character from which the UTF-16 character was
      *>      transformed."
      *> Table 6 makes all three references to a CODED CHARACTER SET, so the observation
      *> point is the coded-set surface, not a collating surface. §12.3.7.4 GR11 c is the
      *> surface used here: "When NATIONAL is specified, the value of figurative constant
      *> symbolic-character-1 is the internal representation of the character at ordinal
      *> position integer-1 in the native national character set or, if the IN phrase is
      *> specified, in the character set referenced by alphabet-name-3." §12.3.7.3 SR16 f1
      *> requires that alphabet to define a NATIONAL character set, which all three phrases
      *> do. So `SYMBOLIC CHARACTERS FOR NATIONAL s IS n IN a` NAMES the character at ordinal
      *> n of a, and FUNCTION ORD then reports which NATIVE national character that is —
      *> §15.70.4 r2 reads the national program collating sequence, which is left NATIVE here,
      *> and §12.3.7.4 GR6 makes the native ordinal association the implementor's ("The
      *> implementor shall define the order of characters within the native alphanumeric
      *> coded character set and the native national coded character set, associating each
      *> character with an ordinal position within the character set"). COBOL.NET's
      *> determination is UTF-16 code units in code-unit order, so the native ordinal of a
      *> character is its code unit + 1 (§15.70.1 "The lowest ordinal position is 1").
      *> Each printed number is therefore THE CORRESPONDENCE GR7 asks the implementor to
      *> document, read out of the compiler.
      *>
      *> A / S - the correspondence on the shared BMP range, at two ordinals, in all three
      *>     sets. Ordinal 66 is the 66th character of each set = U+0041, native ordinal 66;
      *>     ordinal 353 is U+0160, native ordinal 353. The determination is the IDENTITY
      *>     over U+0000..U+D7FF, and the non-ASCII probe is what makes that a measurement
      *>     rather than an accident of the ASCII range.
      *> E - THE DISCRIMINATOR, and it is pure rule text. The characters of UTF-32 (and hence
      *>     of UTF-8, by g's "same association") are the ISO/IEC 10646 SCALAR VALUES; the
      *>     surrogate code points U+D800..U+DFFF are not characters of those sets. Ordinals
      *>     1..55296 are therefore U+0000..U+D7FF and ordinal 55297 is the NEXT scalar value,
      *>     U+E000 — whose native ordinal is 57344 + 1 = 57345. A UCS-4 or UTF-8 coded set
      *>     built as a plain 0-origin table over code units would answer 55297 instead. The
      *>     UTF-16 phrase is deliberately NOT probed at this ordinal: the native national set
      *>     is code units and the standard's own transformation wording leaves that shape a
      *>     separate question, so this golden claims only what f and g settle.
