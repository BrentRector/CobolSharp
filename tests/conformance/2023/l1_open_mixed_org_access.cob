      *> ISO §14.9.27.3 SR4 — "The files referenced in the OPEN
      *> statement need not all have the same organization or access."
      *> A PERMISSIVE rule: conformance means the compiler imposes no
      *> agreement it was not asked for. ONE OPEN statement names a
      *> SEQUENTIAL/ACCESS SEQUENTIAL file, a RELATIVE/ACCESS RANDOM
      *> file and an INDEXED/ACCESS DYNAMIC file — three organizations
      *> and three access modes in one list — and it is written twice,
      *> once OUTPUT and once INPUT.
      *> Expected values, derived only from the rule text:
      *>  - SR4 makes the mixed list legal, so the program COMPILES.
      *>  - §14.9.27.4 GR20: the result "is the same as if a separate
      *>    OPEN statement had been written for each file-name in the
      *>    same order", so each file-name gets its OWN I-O status.
      *>  - Table 18 (§14.9.27.4 GR4): OUTPUT on an unavailable file =
      *>    "Open causes the file to be created"; INPUT on an available
      *>    file = "Normal open". Successful, no further information ⇒
      *>    §9.1.13.2 item 1, '00', on every leg.
      *>  - The three records read back prove each connector really was
      *>    associated with its OWN file, not with a shared one.
