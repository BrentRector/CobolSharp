      *> ISO 14.9.10.4 GR11 - transfer of control after a DELETE RECORD
      *> depends on the presence or absence of the optional INVALID KEY
      *> and NOT INVALID KEY phrases "as specified in 9.1.14, Invalid
      *> key condition". All four 9.1.14 arms are exercised on a
      *> relative file in ACCESS RANDOM (14.9.10.3 SR2 forbids the
      *> phrases in sequential access mode, so random is the only legal
      *> carrier), with a USE AFTER STANDARD ERROR declarative standing
      *> in for "any applicable exception processing statements"
      *> (9.1.12 item 2); its DISPLAY is the observable for whether
      *> exception processing ran.
      *>  A  invalid key condition + INVALID KEY written (9.1.14 item
      *>     2): imp-1 runs and the applicable exception processing
      *>     statements are NOT executed - "INV=23", no "D=" line.
      *>  B  no invalid key condition, successful completion (9.1.14
      *>     not-exists item 2): control goes to the NOT INVALID KEY
      *>     imperative - "NOTINV=00"; INVALID KEY is ignored.
      *>  C  invalid key condition with NO INVALID KEY phrase (9.1.14
      *>     item 3): exception processing IS executed - "D=23" - and
      *>     the NOT INVALID KEY imperative is not taken, because
      *>     not-exists item 2 runs it only on SUCCESSFUL completion.
      *>  D  an unsuccessful completion that is NOT an invalid key
      *>     condition ('49' - 9.1.13.7 item 9; the open mode is not
      *>     I-O, 14.9.10.4 GR1) with INVALID KEY written (9.1.14
      *>     not-exists item 1): the phrase does NOT cover it, so imp-1
      *>     must not run and exception processing must - "D=49"
      *>     appears and "INV-D" does not. This is the arm a blanket
      *>     phrase-suppression gets wrong.
