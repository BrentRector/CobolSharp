      *> ISO 14.9.41.4 GR18/GR19 meet 12.4.5.6.4 GR6 - START FIRST and
      *> START LAST see EVERY record, including the ones an ALTERNATE
      *> RECORD KEY's SUPPRESS WHEN phrase withholds.
      *> GR18 - "the file position indicator is set to the value of the
      *>   primary key of the first existing logical record in the
      *>   physical file and the key of reference is set to the primary
      *>   key"; GR19 the same for LAST and the last existing record.
      *> 12.4.5.6.4 GR6 - "Alternate record key suppression specifies
      *>   that an ALTERNATE RECORD KEY ACCESS PATH to a particular
      *>   record shall not be provided when the value of data-name-1
      *>   or record-key-name-1 in that record is equal to literal-1."
      *> The suppression is a property of the ALTERNATE path alone, so
      *> a FIRST/LAST that ran under an inherited alternate key of
      *> reference would not merely order the file wrongly - it would
      *> not see the suppressed records AT ALL.
      *> SX has RECORD KEY SX-PRIME and ALTERNATE SX-ALT WITH
      *> DUPLICATES SUPPRESS WHEN "ZZ"; the records are
      *>   prime 01 alt ZZ (suppressed) / prime 02 alt MM /
      *>   prime 03 alt ZZ (suppressed)
      *> so the ALTERNATE path offers exactly one record, 02, while
      *> the physical file holds three.
      *>   A  START KEY IS EQUAL TO SX-ALT on "MM" succeeds and makes
      *>      the ALTERNATE the key of reference (14.9.41.4 GR16).
      *>   F1..F3  START FIRST then three READ NEXTs: GR18 positions on
      *>      primary key "01" - a record with NO alternate path - and
      *>      the reads walk 01, 02, 03 in prime order.  F4 is at end
      *>      ('10', 14.9.30.4 GR24).
      *>   L1  START LAST then READ NEXT: GR19 positions on primary key
      *>      "03", also a suppressed one, and the read delivers it.
