      *> ISO 1989:2023 §12.4.5.3 GR3 b) and §13.18.34.4 GR6 b) - THE OPERANDS BELONG TO THE ACTIVATION THAT
      *> EXECUTES THE STATEMENT, not to the last one that ran its prologue. The connector of a RECURSIVE,
      *> non-INITIAL program is UNIT-SCOPED last-used state (§8.6.4 "one copy of the item is available in a run
      *> unit"; §14.6.2.3.3), so ONE connector serves every activation while LOCAL-STORAGE is allocated afresh
      *> for each (§8.6.4) - which makes "whose data item?" observable.
      *>
      *> §13.18.34.4 GR6 b): "If a data-name is specified, the value is the content of the data item referenced
      *> by the associated data-name at the following times when the indicated statement references the
      *> associated file: 1. At the completion of an OPEN statement with the OUTPUT phrase." That statement is
      *> executed by depth 1, AFTER depth 2 has returned.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED, derived from the rules (depth 1's LOCAL-STORAGE: page size 4, footing start 3, file
      *> "pb673o.dat"; depth 2's: page size 9, footing start 9, file "pb673i.dat"):
      *>   OPEN=00   the association is made with depth 1's LS-NAME.
      *>   §13.18.34.4 GR7 d) sets LINAGE-COUNTER to one at the OPEN OUTPUT; each WRITE AFTER ADVANCING 1 LINE
      *>   increments it by one (GR7 c) 2.), so the counters observed after the two writes are 02 and 03.
      *>   EOP=N LC=02  counter 2 is below the footing start 3 - no end-of-page (§14.9.51.4 GR26).
      *>   EOP=Y LC=03  §14.9.51.4 GR26 b): "the execution of the WRITE statement causes printing or spacing
      *>                within the footing area of a page body ... when the associated LINAGE-COUNTER is equal
      *>                to or exceeds the current value of the footing start and is less than the page size" -
      *>                3 >= 3 and 3 < 4.  (Neither write reaches the page size, so GR26 a) never applies and
      *>                this golden does not depend on the GR26 a)/b) boundary at counter = page size, which
      *>                LinageConformanceTests pins.)
      *>   CHKI=05   "pb673i.dat" - depth 2's name - was never associated, so it is absent.
      *>   CHKO=00   "pb673o.dat" - depth 1's name - holds the output.
      *> Before kb/Work PB673 the connector held one installed source closure and one installed LINAGE evaluator
      *> closure, both re-installed unguarded at every activation, so depth 2's returned activation answered
      *> depth 1's OPEN: the wrong file, and a page model with no footing area in reach (EOP=N twice).
