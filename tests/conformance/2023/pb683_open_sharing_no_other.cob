      *> ISO §9.1.15 — "The SHARING phrase on an OPEN statement overrides
      *> the SHARING clause in the file control entry for establishing the
      *> sharing mode.  If there is no SHARING phrase on the OPEN statement,
      *> the sharing mode is determined by the SHARING clause in the file
      *> control entry."  The companion of pb683_open_sharing_read_only for
      *> the OTHER spelling a clause-less SELECT can acquire at OPEN time
      *> (kb/Work PB683), on all three organizations.
      *>
      *> §9.1.15 item 1 — "The sharing with no other mode specifies exclusive
      *> access to a physical file.  Associating this file connector with the
      *> physical file will be unsuccessful if the physical file is currently
      *> open through other file connectors.  If the OPEN statement is
      *> successful, subsequent requests to open the physical file through
      *> other file connectors before this file connector is closed will be
      *> unsuccessful.  Record locks are ignored."  Four observations, and
      *> the golden makes all four, in both directions:
      *>   OPEN N first  → N='00', then S's plain OPEN is refused  ('61')
      *>   OPEN S first  → S='00', then N's NO OTHER OPEN is refused ('61')
      *>   N's own unphrased READ, which is now routed through the record-
      *>   lock-governed path because N IS a sharing participant, still
      *>   answers '00': the governed route may not invent a conflict where
      *>   the standard says record locks are ignored.
      *> '61' is §9.1.13.9 item 1, "the sharing mode ... is incompatible" —
      *> §14.9.27.4 Table 19's Unsuccessful open cell.
      *>
      *> N's file control entry writes NO SHARING clause and NO LOCK MODE
      *> clause: every sharing fact about it comes from its own OPEN
      *> statement, which is exactly the fact a compile-time governance
      *> predicate could not see.
