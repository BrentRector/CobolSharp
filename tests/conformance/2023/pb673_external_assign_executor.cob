      *> ISO 1989:2023 §12.4.5.3 GR3 b) - THE ASSIGN ... USING SOURCE IS THE EXECUTING RUNTIME ELEMENT'S.
      *> "When the USING phrase of the ASSIGN clause is specified, the file connector referenced by file-name-1
      *> is associated with a physical file identified by the content of the data item referenced by data-name-1
      *> in the runtime element that executes the OPEN, SORT, or MERGE statement."
      *>
      *> The connector here is EXTERNAL, so §13.18.22.4 GR4 a) makes it ONE file connector for the whole run
      *> unit ("the file connector associated with this file description entry is an external file connector"),
      *> shared by BOTH describing programs - and §12.4.5.3 GR1 b) asks of their file control entries only "A
      *> consistent specification for data-name-1, device-name-1, and literal-1 in the ASSIGN clause. The
      *> implementor shall specify the consistency rules"; it does NOT require the same data item the way GR1 i)
      *> does for FILE STATUS ("where data-name-4 shall reference the same corresponding external data item").
      *> COBOL.NET's consistency rule is the same data-name SPELLING (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §7, DOC-A.1-72), which
      *> both entries below satisfy while each program keeps its OWN storage for FNAME.
      *>
      *> ORDER OF EVENTS: PB673A activates (registering the run-unit connector), CALLs PB673B - which activates
      *> and is therefore the LAST program to have run its file-section prologue - and only then executes the
      *> OPEN. GR3 b) names the EXECUTOR, so the physical file is the one PB673A's FNAME names.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED, derived from the rule:
      *>   OPEN=00  the association succeeds and the file is created (§14.9.27.4 Table 18, OUTPUT).
      *>   CHKB=05  "pb673b.dat" - the name in the LAST ACTIVATOR's data item - was never associated, so the
      *>            OPTIONAL connector finds it absent (§14.9.27.4 GR14 / §9.1.13.2 item 5).
      *>   CHKA=00  "pb673a.dat" - the name in the EXECUTOR's data item - exists and holds the record.
      *>   READA=AAAAA  read back through the same EXTERNAL connector.
      *> Before kb/Work PB673 the connector held ONE installed source closure, re-installed unguarded at every
      *> activation, so PB673B's FNAME answered PB673A's OPEN: the record landed in pb673b.dat, silently.
