      *> ISO §14.9.49.3 SR7 — "The INPUT, OUTPUT, I-O, and EXTEND phrases may each be specified
      *> only once in the declaratives portion of a given procedure division." This is the
      *> ACCEPTING complement of that rule (its rejecting half is
      *> tests/conformance/negative/l1-use-input-phrase-twice): all FOUR phrases appear, each
      *> exactly once, so the source conforms and each phrase names a DISTINCT open-mode scope.
      *> The four fired handlers are what makes the once-each reading falsifiable: were any two
      *> of the four phrases treated as one scope, this program would have to be rejected as a
      *> duplicate, and were a phrase mapped to the wrong mode the wrong handler line would
      *> appear.
      *> DERIVATION — every expected line follows from the rule text, nothing from the compiler.
      *>  · FI, FIO, FE: §14.9.27.4 GR4 Table 18 — for a NON-optional file that is unavailable,
      *>    "Open is unsuccessful" in the INPUT, I-O and EXTEND rows — and §9.1.13.6 rule 5 gives
      *>    the value: an OPEN "with the INPUT, I-O, or EXTEND phrase … attempted on a file that
      *>    is not described as optional and the physical file is not present" sets I-O status
      *>    35. The corpus runner runs each program in a fresh empty directory and nothing
      *>    creates these three files, so 35 is deterministic.
      *>  · FO: Table 18's OUTPUT row — an unavailable file is CREATED, a normal open — so the
      *>    first OPEN OUTPUT is successful, §9.1.13.2 rule 1 "I-O status = 00". The second is
      *>    §14.9.27.4 GR2, "The file connector referenced by file-name-1 shall not be open. If
      *>    it is open, the execution of the OPEN statement is unsuccessful and the I-O status
      *>    associated with file-name-1 is set to '41'" (§9.1.13.7 rule 1 names the same value).
      *>  · Handler selection is §14.9.49.4 GR6 b) INPUT / c) OUTPUT / d) I-O / e) EXTEND: each
      *>    procedure is executed for a file "open in the <mode> mode or in the process of being
      *>    opened in the <mode> mode". No declarative names a file, so GR3 b) reaches them and
      *>    GR5's file-name precedence never applies.
      *>  · FIO is ORGANIZATION INDEXED so that OPEN I-O is unambiguously an operation the
      *>    organization supports and §9.1.13.6 rule 6 a) 2. (status 37) cannot be the applicable
      *>    rule instead of rule 5.
      *>  · Control returns from each handler by §14.9.33.4 GR2 a) (RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT).
