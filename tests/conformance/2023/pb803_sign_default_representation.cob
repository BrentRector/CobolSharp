      *> ISO §13.18.52.4 GR4 — the operational sign of a signed numeric item whose PICTURE
      *> contains 'S' and to which NO SIGN clause applies (Annex A.1 item 177, §8.5.1.5;
      *> kb/Work PB803, owner decision 2026-09-09).
      *>
      *> THE RULE. §13.18.52.4 GR4: "A numeric item whose picture character-string contains the
      *> symbol 'S', and to which no SIGN clause applies, has an operational sign. Neither the
      *> representation nor the position of that operational sign is specified by the symbol 'S'.
      *> The implementor shall specify the position and representation of the operational sign.
      *> General rules 5 and 6 do not apply to such signed numeric items."  §8.5.1.5 states the
      *> obligation from the other end: "This clause is optional; if it is not used, operational
      *> signs will be represented as defined by the implementor."
      *>
      *> THE DETERMINATION PINNED HERE (docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-177). The sign is fused onto
      *> the TRAILING digit position, and WHICH character the digit becomes is the compile option
      *> --sign-encoding, whose default `ibm` is in force for this program: positive 0-9 fuse to
      *> "{ABCDEFGHI" and negative 0-9 to "}JKLMNOPQR".  So -123 is `12L` (negative table position
      *> 3) and +123 is `12C` (positive table position 3), and the fused sign occupies an EXISTING
      *> digit position: the item is 3 character positions, never 4.  The ALTERNATIVE convention is
      *> pinned by conformance:2023/pb803_sign_encoding_ascii, which compiles under
      *> `*> options: sign-encoding=ascii`.
      *>
      *> WHY EACH LEG CAN FAIL — expected values derived from the determination above, not observed.
      *> NEG / POS read the two table halves as RAW CHARACTERS through an alphanumeric GROUP move
      *>   (§14.9.25.4 GR4: a group move transfers character positions "without consideration for
      *>   the individual elementary or group items contained within"), so what is displayed is the
      *>   STORAGE and not a re-rendering of the value.
      *> The `|` sentinel immediately after the signed item inside the same group is what makes the
      *>   WIDTH claim falsifiable: were the fused sign to take a character position of its own, the
      *>   sentinel would sit at position 5 and the 4-character window would show the digits shifted
      *>   with no `|` at all.  FUNCTION BYTE-LENGTH states the same two widths independently (3 for
      *>   the item, 4 for the group), so the leg fails if either reader alone drifts.
      *> TRAIL / LEAD are GR4's OTHER half, the POSITION, and they are the reference points that
      *>   make the claim refutable: an item that WRITES `SIGN IS TRAILING` must produce the SAME
      *>   image as the no-clause item (`12L`) and one that writes `SIGN IS LEADING` a DIFFERENT one
      *>   (`J23`).  A determination of LEADING would invert both comparisons.
      *> VNEG / VPOS close the round trip: the character that carried the sign carries it back, so
      *>   the representation and the algebraic value are pinned to agree rather than separately.
