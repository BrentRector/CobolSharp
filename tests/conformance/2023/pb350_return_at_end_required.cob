      *> ISO §14.9.34.2 — RETURN's AT END phrase is MANDATORY, and the two shapes that keep it so are legal.

      *>     RETURN file-name-1 RECORD [ INTO identifier-1 ]
      *>         AT END imperative-statement-1
      *>         [ NOT AT END imperative-statement-2 ]
      *>         [ END-RETURN ]
      *> — the AT END line carries NO brackets while the two lines under it do, and §5.2.6.2 makes brackets
      *> the only convention that lets a portion of a general format be omitted. This is the ACCEPT side of
      *> COBOLNET1850 (kb/Work PB350): both a bare AT END and the §14.9.34.3 SR4 REVERSED pair still compile,
      *> because the screen keys on the AT END phrase being ABSENT, never on the order it is written in.

      *>    is associated with the ASCENDING phrase, the record containing the key data item with the lower
      *>    value is returned first" — released 3/CCC, 1/AAA, 2/BBB, so every drain returns AAA, BBB, CCC.
      *>  · §14.9.34.4 GR4: with no at end condition "control is transferred to imperative-statement-2, if
      *>    specified; otherwise, control is transferred to the end of the RETURN statement". DRAIN-1 writes
      *>    NO NOT AT END phrase, so its three successful returns fall to the end of the statement and the
      *>    guarded DISPLAY after END-RETURN prints A=AAA / A=BBB / A=CCC. DRAIN-2 writes one, in SR4's
      *>    reversed order, so its three successful returns transfer INTO it and print B=AAA / B=BBB / B=CCC.
      *>  · §14.9.34.4 GR3: on the fourth execution "the at end condition is set to exist and control is
      *>    transferred to imperative-statement-1 of the AT END phrase. If control is returned from
      *>    imperative-statement-1, control is then transferred to the end of the RETURN statement" — so each
      *>    AT END sets its flag, the PERFORM UNTIL re-tests it and the loop ends. The same rule says the
      *>    record area is UNDEFINED once the at end condition exists, which is why DRAIN-1's DISPLAY is
      *>    guarded by the flag and DRAIN-2 reads the record only from the NOT AT END arm.
