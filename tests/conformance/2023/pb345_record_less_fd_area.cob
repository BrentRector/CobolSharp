      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §13.4.5.3 SR3 -- "When no record description entries are
      *> specified: a) a RECORD clause shall be specified in the file description entry,
      *> ... c) an INTO phrase shall be specified on all READ statements associated with
      *> the file." SR7 withdraws that permission only "For an indexed file", so BOTH of
      *> the record-description-less file description entries below -- SEQUENTIAL FIN and
      *> RELATIVE RLF -- are LEGAL source.
      *> §14.9.30.4 GR6 says what such a file's record area IS: "The execution of a READ
      *> statement with the INTO phrase when there are no record description entries
      *> subordinate to the file description entry proceeds as though there were one
      *> record description entry describing an alphanumeric group item of the maximum
      *> size established by the RECORD clause."
      *> kb/Work PB345: before it, NEITHER organization registered a file connector for
      *> such an entry and the first I-O verb aborted the run unit.
      *>
      *> DERIVATION of every line of the .out --
      *>   OPEN=00  §9.1.13.2 item 1: "The input-output statement is successfully executed
      *>            and no further information is available concerning the input-output
      *>            operation."
      *>   R1       the implied 20-byte area moved to a PIC X(20) receiver: same bytes.
      *>   R2       the implied entry is a GROUP item, so §14.9.25.4 GR4 second paragraph
      *>            governs the implicit MOVE -- "Any move that is not an elementary move
      *>            ... is treated exactly as if it were an alphanumeric to alphanumeric
      *>            elementary move" -- and the leftmost 5 characters of
      *>            "12345ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO" land in the PIC 9(5) receiver: 12345. Were the
      *>            implied entry an ELEMENTARY alphanumeric item instead, GR4's FIRST
      *>            paragraph would make this an elementary alphanumeric-to-numeric move
      *>            of all 20 characters, which are not a numeric value at all. This line
      *>            is what pins GR6's word "group".
      *>   R3=10    §9.1.13.4 item 1 a): "A sequential READ statement is attempted and no
      *>            next or prior logical record exists in the physical file because
      *>            a) NEXT was specified or implied and the end of the physical file has
      *>            been reached".
      *>   U1=42    UNLOCK on a CLOSED connector. §14.9.47.4 GR2 -- "File-name-1 shall
      *>            reference a file connector in the open mode." -- is unmet, GR3 --
      *>            "The execution of the UNLOCK statement causes the value of the I-O
      *>            status of the file connector referenced by file-name-1 to be updated."
      *>            -- still applies, and §9.1.13.7 item 2 names the value: "I-O status =
      *>            42. A CLOSE or UNLOCK statement is attempted for a file connector that
      *>            is not in an open mode." RS is seeded "ZZ" first, so 42 is measured
      *>            and not left over.
      *>   RD1=47   READ on a CLOSED connector: §9.1.13.7 item 7, "The execution of a READ
      *>            or START statement is attempted referencing a file connector that is
      *>            not open in the input or I-O mode."
      *>   OO=00 / CL=00   successful OPEN OUTPUT and CLOSE (§9.1.13.2 item 1).
      *>   U2=00    UNLOCK on an OPEN connector: §14.9.47.4 GR1 -- "The presence or
      *>            absence of any record locks does not affect the success of the
      *>            execution of the UNLOCK statement."
      *>   RD2=23   a RANDOM READ of relative record 1 of the empty file just created:
