      *>
      *> §14.2.3 GR8: "If the argument is passed by reference, the activated runtime element operates as if the
      *> formal parameter occupies the same storage area as the argument" - which COBOL.NET realizes through the
      *> generated AsImage()/FromImage() round trip. §14.9.23.4 GR8 delivers the RETURNING item the same way.
      *> So every leaf value the invoker sets must come back byte-identical, whatever the leaf's usage.
      *>
      *> THE DEFECT: OoEmitter.EmitMethod spelled `{root}.FromImage({param})` and `{formal}.AsImage()` itself,
      *> with NO capability consult - while RecordStructEmitter emits that codec for exactly ElementImageCapable
      *> items. A method DECLARING an imageless group formal therefore failed BACKEND compilation (CS1061), and
      *> nothing invoked it: DataBinder.Oo applies no image screen, and OoConformance.DescriptionMismatch's
      *> !formal.IsImageCapable arm runs only when an INVOKE or an override/implements PAIR exists. The three
      *> sites now route through PlaceRenderer, THE ONE channel; held by BoundaryImageChannelTests.
      *>
      *> LEG 1 is also the REGRESSION NET for a repro that DISSOLVED: PB177's note named `05 N USAGE INDEX` as
      *> its crash shape twice, but PicInfo.IndexItem is (Numeric, Usage.Index) and ByteForm maps Usage.Index to
      *> Binary, so HasImageByteForm is TRUE and an INDEX-leaf group has been fully image-capable since R40.
      *> The formal here spans EVERY leaf kind the R40 + PB164 widening admits, so the dissolution stays proved.
      *> LEGS 2 and 3 are the SURVIVING live repros, compiled but never invoked - the pointer/object-class leaf
      *> (PicCategory.Pointer is in neither ElementImageCapable list) and the variable-length group
      *> (IsImageCapable short-circuits on the dynamic axis). Both crashed the backend before this fix; both now
      *> emit the documented Tier-C loud in a body nobody runs, so the compilation group builds.
