      *> PB13 (siblings) - the float->fixed quantizer's three OTHER faces. The headroom golden
      *> pb13_float_quantize_headroom pins the two cases the fix-queue entry carried; this one pins the cases the
      *> SWEEP for that entry's siblings found (CLAUDE.md rule 4 - every bug is a pattern), each of which was

      *> THE MECHANISM, once: CobolIntrinsics#FromDouble lands a double at a WORKING scale and saturates at
      *> Int128.MaxValue. The store then rescales working->receiver scale, which DIVIDES the saturation sentinel
      *> back down and so destroys the evidence the receiver's digit-capacity check exists to see. That is why the
      *> saturation was SILENT rather than a size error. ReceiverContext.FloatWorkingScale now caps the working
      *> scale at the receiver's Int128 headroom (ws <= 38 - integer digits), which makes a value that FITS never
      *> saturate and a value that does NOT always trip the capacity check.
      *>
      *> SIBLING 1 - NumericRenderer#Power reaches the SAME quantizer with the SAME formula, so ** carried the
      *> identical defect: 10 ** 30 into PIC 9(31) stored 0170141183460469231731687303715. 8.8.1.2 r6 places no
      *> exactness requirement on a native exponentiation and 8.8.1.3 makes native arithmetic implementor-defined,
      *> so only the MAGNITUDE is asserted here - a saturated result differs in the first digit.
      *>
      *> SIBLING 2 - the receiver-less ** relation, the exact shape of the headroom golden's EXP10 case: with no
      *> receiver there is no scale to quantize to, both sides saturated to the same Int128.MaxValue, and two
      *> values a FACTOR OF TEN apart compared EQUAL. 8.8.4.2.4 makes a native comparison proceed by the rules of
      *> native arithmetic, and 15.4.1 leaves the returned value's representation to the implementor - COBOL.NET's
      *> determination is binary64, so 10**30 and 10**31 are distinct and the relation is FALSE.
      *>
      *> SIBLING 3 - a value that genuinely EXCEEDS the receiver must raise the size error condition, never store a
      *> saturated one. 14.7.5 case 5 makes an out-of-range native intermediate a size error condition when the
      *> implementor defines that range as checked; EXP(700) is about 1E+304 and cannot fit PIC 9(31).
      *>
      *> SIBLING 4 - the receiver-less TEXT channel. This printed 170141183460469231731687303715.884105727 - the
      *> saturation sentinel rendered as if it were the value. docs/CONFORMANCE.md's 15.4.1 / 14.9.11.4 GR1
      *> determination already required that a FLOAT-valued function render through the same shortest-round-trip
