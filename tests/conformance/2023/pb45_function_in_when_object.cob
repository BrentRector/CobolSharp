      *> ISO 14.9.13 - A FUNCTION-IDENTIFIER AS AN EVALUATE SELECTION OBJECT
      *> (fix-queue PB45, the open half). 8.4.3.1.2 Format 1 makes a function-
      *> identifier an identifier, and 14.9.13.2 writes the selection object as
      *> identifier-2 / arithmetic-expression-2 / condition-2 - all sending, so
      *> 8.4.3.2.3 SR1 (receiving only) does not bar it.
      *>
      *> IT WAS THE GRAMMAR'S ARITY, NOT THE LEXER AND NOT THE ALTERNATIVE ORDER.
      *> evaluateWhenGroup was `NOT? evaluateWhenItem+`, but 14.9.13.2's format is
      *> `{ { WHEN selection-object [ ALSO selection-object ] ... } ... }` - objects
      *> repeat ONLY through ALSO, never by juxtaposition (SR2 fixes the count
      *> against the subjects). That unlicensed `+` gave `WHEN FUNCTION SQRT(W-Z) > 1`
      *> a second reading: take `FUNCTION SQRT` as a bare zero-argument object and
      *> re-read the ARGUMENT PARENTHESIS as a second object `(W-Z) > 1`. The correct
      *> reading cannot consume the trailing `> 1` once the item ends, so only the
      *> peel survived - and it bound as a VALUE object under an EVALUATE TRUE
      *> subject: a CLEAN COMPILE that threw at RUN TIME. For an alphanumeric
      *> function (T3) the same peel was a raw parse error instead.
      *> `FUNCTION PI > 1` (T4) always worked - it has no parenthesis to peel, which
      *> is what identified the argument parenthesis as the discriminator.
      *>
      *> WHY BOTH BRANCHES OF EVERY TEST ARE EXERCISED: a WHEN object that wrongly
      *> matches EVERYTHING passes a one-branch golden. T2 is the false case of T1.
      *> T6-T10 pin the arms an alternative REORDER would silently retarget
      *> (14.9.13.4 Table 15 makes the object's legality depend on the SUBJECT), so a
      *> future "just put condition before valueOperand" edit fails here.
      *>
      *> FUNCTION SQRT(4) = 2 throughout.
