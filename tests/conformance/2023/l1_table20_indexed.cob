      *> ISO §14.9.27.4 GR8 — "In Table 20, Permissible I-O statements
      *> by access mode and open mode, 'X' at an intersection indicates
      *> that the specified statement, used in the access mode given
      *> for that row, may be used with the open mode given at the top

      *> This program walks Table 20 for the INDEXED organization;
      *> l1_table20_seq_relative.cob walks it for SEQUENTIAL and
      *> RELATIVE. Every X cell is exercised and shall report success;
      *> every BLANK cell is exercised and shall report the status
      *> §9.1.13.7 names for it:
      *>   item 7 → '47'  READ or START, connector not open input/I-O
      *>   item 8 → '48'  WRITE: a) access sequential and not open
      *>                  extend/output; b) access random or dynamic
      *>                  and not open I-O/output
      *>   item 9 → '49'  REWRITE or DELETE RECORD, not open I-O
      *> The Extend column for the Random and Dynamic rows is blank but
      *> UNREACHABLE from legal source — §14.9.27.3 SR2 confines EXTEND
      *> to sequential access — so it is pinned at the runtime instead,
      *> by unit:Table20WriteOpenModeTests (kb/Work PB325).
      *> The Random row's START cells are blank in every column:
      *> §14.9.41.3 SR1 rejects that at compile time (see
      *> conformance:negative/pb325-start-random-access).
