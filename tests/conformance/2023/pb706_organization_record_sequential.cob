      *> ORGANIZATION IS RECORD SEQUENTIAL (kb/Work PB706).
      *> ISO 12.4.5.10.2 prints the ORGANIZATION clause as
      *>     [ ORGANIZATION IS ] { { LINE | RECORD } SEQUENTIAL
      *>                         | RELATIVE | INDEXED }
      *> and the rendered page (PDF p357) underlines LINE and SEQUENTIAL
      *> but NOT RECORD: an optional word (5.2.3), so RECORD SEQUENTIAL
      *> and a bare SEQUENTIAL are the same alternative.  12.4.5.10.3 GR3:
      *> "The RECORD SEQUENTIAL phrase specifies that the file
      *> organization is record sequential."  GR6: "When the ORGANIZATION
      *> clause is not specified, sequential organization with the RECORD
      *> SEQUENTIAL phrase is implied."  The phrase was a raw parse error
      *> (no grammar alternative) at every edition.
      *>
      *> Three files, one per spelling - RECORD SEQUENTIAL written out,
      *> bare SEQUENTIAL (ORGANIZATION IS omitted too), and no clause -
      *> each written two records and read back.  All three are the same
      *> organization, so every leg reads back exactly what it wrote:
      *>   R: AAAA / BBBB   S: CCCC / DDDD   T: EEEE / FFFF
      *> A leg that mis-bound RECORD SEQUENTIAL to another organization
      *> (or dropped the SELECT) would fail the READ or print nothing.
