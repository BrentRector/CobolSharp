      *> ISO §14.9.18.2 / §14.9.18.4 GR3 — GOBACK … WITH {ERROR|NORMAL} STATUS [id|lit] (COBOL-2023: annex
      *> item 32 adds to GOBACK the same status phrase STOP allows). In a main program a GOBACK operates as a
      *> STOP statement carrying the status phrase (GR3), so the run unit terminates normally here. The phrase is
      *> parsed, 2023-introduction-gated, and its VALUE wired to the process exit code (§14.9.18.4 GR10 →
      *> RunUnit.ExitStatus → Environment.ExitCode). This stdout golden keeps to NORMAL STATUS 0 (exit 0, which the
      *> golden harness's ExitCode==0 check requires); the nonzero-status exit codes are asserted by
      *> StopGobackExitCodeTests.
