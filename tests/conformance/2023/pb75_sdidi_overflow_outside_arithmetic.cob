      *> PB75 - a size error raised OUTSIDE an arithmetic statement is the fatal exception condition 14.7.5's
      *> no-phrase rules name, not a raw CLR crash. 14.7.5: the size error condition "may occur as a result of ...
      *> the evaluation of an arithmetic expression", and with no SIZE ERROR phrase EC-SIZE-OVERFLOW "is set to
      *> exist, and processing proceeds as specified in 14.6.13.1.3": #5 - a USE declarative for the condition runs
      *> (RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT continues after the offending statement - 14.9.33.4 GR2a3: "the lowest level
      *> statement, not the containing statement", NOTE 1: after the END-IF even though neither branch ran); #4 - an
      *> enclosing exception-checking PERFORM's WHEN handler runs (its RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT likewise; without one
      *> the run unit terminates abnormally after the handler); and an arithmetic statement's own ON SIZE ERROR
      *> phrase still takes precedence (#1). ONE dispatch per raise: the PERFORM's own guard lets the condition its
      *> inner statement already dispatched pass (before this landing every enclosing statement re-dispatched it -
      *> the USE declarative ran twice for one raise inside a PERFORM). Under STANDARD-DECIMAL 10 ** 100000 exceeds decimal128 (8.8.1.5.2 r2) in a CONDITION, a FUNCTION
      *> ARGUMENT, and a MOVE sender - each used to die with an unhandled CobolSizeError, exit 127.
      *> (With checking OFF the same raise reaches the run-unit boundary and terminates loudly, exit 1 -
      *> 14.6.13.1.3 #8, the implementor's documented choice; pinned by SdidiOverflowDispositionTests.)
