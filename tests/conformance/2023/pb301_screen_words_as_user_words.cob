      *> kb/Work PB301 - the COBOL-2023 half of the screen-word rule. ISO 8.10 lists these fifteen words as
      *> CONTEXT-SENSITIVE ("screen description entry", and for BELL, BLINK, HIGHLIGHT, LOWLIGHT, REVERSE-VIDEO
      *> and UNDERLINE also "SET attribute statement"), and 8.9 reserves NONE of them at ANY edition - so
      *> 8.3.2.1 rule 3 makes every one a legal user-defined word here, exactly as at COBOL-85
      *> (tests/conformance/85/pb301_screen_words_as_user_words). This is the twin that would catch a
      *> reservation gate applied to the wrong axis: a word this compiler tokenizes for a DECLINED module is
      *> still the user's to name, and the SCREEN-position complement - the same words still recognized in
      *> their own clause and refused BY NAME - is the a42-screen-* negative set.
