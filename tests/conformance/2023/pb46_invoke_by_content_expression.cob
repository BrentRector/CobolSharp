      *> ISO 14.9.23.2 — the INVOKE general format's BY CONTENT branch admits
      *> `arithmetic-expression-1 | boolean-expression-1 | identifier-5 |
      *> literal-2`. Read off the RENDERED figure, not the prose.
      *>
      *> `invokeArgument` admitted only `(dataReference | literal)`, and the
      *> failure was NOT a parse error (fix-queue PB46). `BY CONTENT N + 1`
      *> matched `N` as a dataReference and started a SECOND argument at `+ 1`,
      *> so the statement reported COBOLNET0828 "2 USING argument(s) for 1
      *> formal parameter(s)" — an arity diagnostic about a rule the program
      *> does not violate, pointing the reader at the method signature. A silent
      *> mis-parse is worse than a rejection.

      *> 14.8.2.3.3 rule 2a governs the crossing: an expression is transferred
      *> "according to the rules of the COMPUTE statement", so the formal must be

      *> `BY CONTENT A` silently began matching the expression arm — losing the
      *> 14.9.23.3 SR9/SR10 object-data rules, the 14.8.2.3.2 conformance check
      *> and the ref-mod handling — while `BY CONTENT "XY"` stopped binding at
      *> all. Both are asserted here so that regression cannot return.
