      *> ISO §15.37.4 rule 5 — "If argument-1 or argument-2 is of zero length, the function shall
      *> return zero." — plus the degenerate reach of rule 3 ("If no match is found, the function
      *> shall return zero") where argument-2 is LONGER than argument-1 and the scan has no position
      *> to start from.
      *>
      *> A zero-length operand is legal here and its result is DEFINED, not diagnosed: §8.3.3.1 makes
      *> `""` a zero-length literal ("If the opening and closing delimiters are contiguous, the length
      *> of the literal is zero, and it is known as a zero-length literal"), §15.37.3 states no
      *> prohibition on one — unlike §15.59.3 r3, §15.63.3 r3, §15.66.3 r3, §15.71.3 r2 and §15.72.3 r2,
      *> which each read "Argument-1 shall not be a zero-length literal.", and §15.85.3 r4, which reads
      *> "Neither argument-1 nor argument-2 shall be a zero-length literal." — and r5 gives the answer.
      *> So every Z line below must COMPILE and return zero.
      *>
      *> r5's subject is "argument-1 or argument-2", which §15.37.3 r1 defines as "a data item or
      *> literal", and §8.5.4 (Zero-length items) lists nine ways to BE one — eight of them DATA
      *> ITEMS, whose length is a RUN-TIME fact rather than a compile-time constant. A file of
      *> zero-length LITERALS alone would leave that whole half unreached, so three species are
      *> written: the zero-length literal (§8.5.4 item 8 — Z1..Z6), a group containing only an
      *> occurs-depending table whose current number of occurrences is zero (item 1 — ZG1/ZG2, whose
      *> extent is set at run time by MOVE 0 TO ZN), and a reference-modified item that has resolved
      *> to a length of zero under >>REF-MOD-ZERO-LENGTH (item 9 — ZR1/ZR2).
      *> ZN is declared OUTSIDE ZG on purpose: that is the arm of §13.18.38.4 GR8 a) which states the
      *> consequence outright — "If the data item referenced by data-name-1 is outside the group, only
      *> that part of the table area that is specified by the value of the data item referenced by
      *> data-name-1 at the start of the operation will be used. If there are no elementary data items
      *> defined between the data description entry of the group data item and the definition of the
      *> table ... and the value ... at the start of the operation is zero, the group data item is a
      *> zero-length item." ZT is ZG's only subordinate, so nothing stands between them.
      *>
      *> r5 is unconditional: it names no phrase and no exception, so Z4 (LAST, START AFTER 1 and
      *> ANYCASE all written over a zero-length argument-2) is zero for the same reason as Z2.
      *> POPULATION GUARDS — a file whose every expected value is zero can pass for the wrong reason,
      *> so each species is paired with a reach that is NOT zero-length and must answer non-zero:
      *> CTRL / NCTRL use the same alphanumeric and national items over non-zero-length operands, and
      *> ZGCTRL is the SAME ODO group read at its full three-occurrence extent, so a run that read a
      *> stale or fixed extent instead of a zero one would answer 2 at ZG1 and 1 at ZG2, not 0.
