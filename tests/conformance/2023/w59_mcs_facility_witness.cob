      *> kb/Work R43 / PB1198 — the asynchronous messaging (MCS) facility
      *> is DECLINED. Annex A.3 item 4: "The asynchronous messaging
      *> facility is dependent on the capability of a processor to allow
      *> run units to communicate with each other." §4.2.6 lets an
      *> implementor decline it ("Language elements that pertain to
      *> specific processor-dependent elements for which support is not
      *> claimed need not be implemented") and makes the compile-time
      *> WARNING mandatory: "An implementation shall provide a warning
      *> mechanism at compile time to indicate use of syntactically-
      *> detectable processor-dependent language elements not supported
      *> by that implementation." That warning, COBOLNET1578, once at
      *> the RECEIVE and once at the SEND, is the DECLINE half, pinned by
      *> conformance-test DocumentedNonSupportWitnessTests.
      *> THE OUTPUT IS THE INERT HALF. Declined, neither statement
      *> performs message I-O, so no message is ever received or sent:
      *> neither the ON EXCEPTION nor the NOT ON EXCEPTION imperative
      *> runs, the receiving area keeps its VALUE, and control reaches
      *> the next statement. A conforming MCS would print OK or EXC at
      *> each statement (§14.9.31.4 GR4/GR5, §14.9.38.4 GR2/GR3), so this
      *> .out is the posture docs/CONFORMANCE.md §4 item 1 documents, and
      *> it discriminates a silently half-implemented facility from the
      *> declined one.
