      *> TWO CAUSES, NEITHER THE ONE THE QUEUE ENTRY NAMED. The entry blamed a
      *> missing arm in ReferenceResolver.RenderSegment's token switch; PB42 had
      *> already widened that switch's `default:` to route everything
      *> unrenderable to the D18 materializer, so no arm was missing. What was:
      *>   (a) the SUB_IDENTIFIER arm returned null instead of routing to D18 -
      *>       SUBSCRIPT mode has no ZERO token, so the figurative arrives as a
      *>       plain identifier, resolves to no data item, and that early return
      *>       was the ONE place in the renderer deciding a segment was
      *>       unrenderable without asking D18; and
      *>   (b) SubscriptExpressionFragment - the D18 re-parse itself - did not
      *>       apply ZeroTokenRewriter, so even once routed there the bare ZERO
      *>       could not match arithmeticExpression.
      *> Both had to go for either symptom to work.
