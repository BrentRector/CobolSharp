      *> ISO 14.9.40.4 GR15 a): "The processing of the file is initiated.
      *> The initiation is performed as if an OPEN statement with the OUTPUT
      *> and SHARING WITH NO OTHER phrases had been executed.  This
      *> initiation is performed after the execution of any input
      *> procedure."  9.1.15 1) is what the phrase buys: "The sharing with
      *> no other mode specifies exclusive access to a physical file."
      *>
      *> The exclusive half of that mode — refusing OTHER connectors while
      *> the GIVING file is open — is not reachable from a single-threaded
      *> COBOL program, because no statement of the program's runs between
      *> the implicit OPEN and the implicit CLOSE; CobolFileLockTests
      *> pins it at the registry, where the emitted call lands.  What IS
      *> reachable, and what this golden pins, is the other half: the
      *> as-if OPEN's own I-O status.  9.1.13.1 — "The value of the I-O
      *> status is set during the execution of a CLOSE, DELETE, OPEN, READ,
      *> REWRITE, START, UNLOCK or WRITE statement and prior to the
      *> execution of ... any applicable exception processing statements" —
      *> with 12.4.5.8.4 GR1 puts it in the FILE STATUS item before the USE
      *> procedure GR15 a) invokes ("if there is an applicable USE procedure
      *> that completes normally, processing for the file connector that
      *> caused the exception condition is bypassed").  D-ST is seeded "ZZ",
      *> so an implicit OPEN that stored no status shows as "ZZ".
