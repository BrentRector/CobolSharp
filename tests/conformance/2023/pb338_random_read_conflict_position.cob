      *> ISO §14.9.30.4 GR10 a) and d) on the FORMAT-2 (random) READ —
      *> "If the record operation conflict condition exists as a result
      *> of the READ statement: a) The file position indicator is
      *> unchanged. ... d) The key of reference for indexed files is
      *> unchanged."  GR10 is an ALL FORMATS rule; the two legs below
      *> are the only two organizations Format 2 admits.
      *>
      *> LEG I — THE KEY OF REFERENCE (GR10 d).  One indexed file, prime
      *> key P1/P2/P3 carrying AAAAA/BBBBB/CCCCC and an ALTERNATE key
      *> whose order is the exact REVERSE (Z3/Z2/Z1), so the two walks
      *> diverge and the answer names which one ran.
      *>   I-ST : START B KEY IS NOT LESS THAN the alternate key makes
      *>          the ALTERNATE the key of reference (§14.9.41.4 GR16).
      *>   I-N1 : the first READ NEXT then delivers the LOWEST alternate
      *>          key, Z1 — the record whose prime key is P3, CCCCC
      *>          (§14.9.30.4 GR21 indexed rule d) 1.).
      *>   I-A  : the other connector locks the record whose PRIME key
      *>          is P3 with a random READ ... WITH LOCK (§12.4.5.9.4
      *>          GR5 — manual locking obtains a lock only with the
      *>          explicit phrase).
      *>   I-R  : B now executes a FORMAT-2 random READ on its PRIME
      *>          key P3.  §14.9.30.4 GR30/GR31 would establish the
      *>          prime key as B's key of reference "for this retrieval"
      *>          — but the record is locked by another file connector,
      *>          so GR9 + §9.1.13.8 item 1 make it '51' and GR10 d)
      *>          leaves the key of reference UNCHANGED: still the
      *>          alternate.  GR10 a) likewise leaves the file position
      *>          indicator at Z1.
      *>   I-N2 : THE DISCRIMINATOR.  A READ NEXT under ACCESS DYNAMIC
      *>          continues in the key of reference (GR30/GR31 —
      *>          "this key of reference is also used for retrievals by
      *>          any subsequent executions of sequential format READ
      *>          statements"), so it delivers the next record in
      *>          ALTERNATE order after Z1: Z2, whose data is BBBBB.
      *>          Had the refused READ established the prime key of
      *>          reference and moved the indicator to P3, this READ
      *>          would answer '10' — P3 is the LAST record in prime
      *>          order (kb/Work PB338).
      *>
      *> LEG R — THE FILE POSITION INDICATOR (GR10 a).  One relative
      *> file, five records.  §14.9.30.4 GR29: "For a relative file,
      *> execution of a READ statement sets the file position indicator
      *> to the value contained in the data item referenced by the
      *> RELATIVE KEY clause for the file".
      *>   R-N1 : a sequential READ NEXT leaves the indicator at RRN 1.
      *>   R-A  : the other connector locks RRN 4.
      *>   R-R  : B's FORMAT-2 random READ of RRN 4 is refused '51', and
      *>          GR10 a) forbids GR29's assignment — the indicator is
      *>          still 1.
      *>   R-N2 : so the next sequential READ delivers RRN 2 (GR21
      *>          relative rule c), "greater than the file position
      *>          indicator"), NOT RRN 5.
