      *> Wave H — the ISO §4.2.6 ¶3 recognize-and-name band. MCS (SEND/RECEIVE), COMMIT/ROLLBACK and
      *> VALIDATE are facilities COBOL.NET does not implement: MCS and commit/rollback are PROCESSOR-DEPENDENT
      *> (§4.2.6, Annex A.3 items 4 and 6-7) and VALIDATE is OPTIONAL (§4.2.7, A.4.14) and, at 2023, also
      *> OBSOLETE (§4.2.13, F.2 item 5). §4.2.6 ¶3 nonetheless makes the compile-time WARNING MECHANISM
      *> mandatory, and §14.6.13.1.1 licenses raising no exception condition for them.
      *> This golden pins the resulting posture: the program COMPILES, RUNS, and the facilities are INERT —
      *> named warnings COBOLNET1578/1579/1580 go to the non-failing compile channel (not stdout), so the
      *> observable behaviour is simply that the surrounding statements execute normally.
      *> Before Wave H each of these was a GENERIC parse error, which satisfied neither the warning
      *> obligation nor the project's never-a-silent-wrong-answer rule.
