      *> ISO §14.9.22 — INSPECT BACKWARD (COBOL-2023: Annex E.3 item 34 adds the BACKWARD context-sensitive
      *> word to INSPECT): inspection proceeds right-to-left. Re-editioned from 2002 at the W3 audit (DEVLOG 597).
      *> R: FIRST "A" backward = the RIGHTMOST "A" (forward FIRST would hit index 0).
      *>    "ABABA" -> "ABAB*".
      *> T: LEADING "0" backward counts the trailing run of zeros (2). Forward LEADING would be 0.
      *> C: CONVERTING "AB"->"XY" BEFORE INITIAL "-" backward converts only the segment to the RIGHT
      *>    of the rightmost "-" (the part scanned before reaching "-"): "AB-AB" -> "AB-XY".
