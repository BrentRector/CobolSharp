      *> ISO 14.9.23.2 — the INVOKE general format's BY CONTENT branch admits
      *> `arithmetic-expression-1 | boolean-expression-1 | identifier-5 |
      *> literal-2`. The arithmetic operand landed in a previous change
      *> (pb46_invoke_by_content_expression); this is boolean-expression-1, the
      *> operand BY VALUE deliberately does NOT carry, and the one that needed a
      *> value channel of its own (D-B1: a '0'/'1' bit string, never the numeric
      *> or DISPLAY channel).
      *>
      *> THE ROOT CAUSE WAS ONE LAYER LOWER AND FAR WIDER THAN THE OPERAND.
      *> 14.8.2.3.2's identical-description check switched on the formal's
      *> category with arms for object-reference, numeric and alphanumeric, and a
      *> default that answered "formal category {c} is not yet carried across
      *> INVOKE". So a category-BOOLEAN, category-NATIONAL, NUMERIC-EDITED,
      *> POINTER or PROGRAM-POINTER formal parameter was impossible in EVERY
      *> passing mode — BY REFERENCE, BY CONTENT and bare alike. Nothing was
      *> missing but the screen: the three string-imaged categories were already
      *> carried by the marshaling arms. 14.8.2.3.2 states one rule for every
      *> category, and its own lettered exceptions b and c pair a BIT GROUP and a
      *> NATIONAL GROUP with the matching elementary items.
      *>
      *> The crossing itself is 14.8.2.3.3 rule 2d — a non-numeric formal takes
      *> "the same [rules] as for a MOVE statement with the argument as the
      *> sending operand" — so 14.9.25.3 Table 16's BOOLEAN row governs: boolean
      *> and alphanumeric receivers are "Yes", alphabetic / numeric /
      *> numeric-edited are "No" (the negative fixture
      *> pb46-invoke-by-content-boolean-numeric-formal).
      *>
      *> WATCH THE OVER-REACH CONTROLS (13-16). The boolean alternative is gated
      *> by {boolExprAhead()}?, the SHARED condition predicate, whose scan runs to
      *> the statement's period — so in `BY CONTENT N + 1 BY CONTENT B1 B-AND B2`
      *> the FIRST argument reaches the boolean node on the strength of the
      *> SECOND argument's B-AND. The binder reduces a B-operator-free boolean
      *> expression back to its bare operand, so all four earlier channels bind
      *> exactly as they would alone. InvokeContentOperandChannelTests asserts the
      *> over-reach really happens, which is what makes these four evidence.
