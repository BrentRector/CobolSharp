      *> ISO §13.18.60.4 GR4 — USAGE BINARY: computer storage allocation, alignment and
      *> representation of data (Annex A.1 item 205; docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-205).
      *>
      *> THE RULE. §13.18.60.4 GR4: "The USAGE BINARY clause specifies that a radix of 2 is
      *> used to represent a numeric item in the storage of the computer. Each implementor
      *> specifies the precise effect of the USAGE BINARY clause upon the alignment and
      *> representation of the data item in the storage of the computer, including the
      *> representation of any algebraic sign. Sufficient computer storage shall be allocated
      *> by the implementor to contain the maximum range of values implied by the associated
      *> decimal picture character-string."
      *> Three obligations, one leg each: a WIDTH that is sufficient, an ALIGNMENT, and a
      *> REPRESENTATION including the sign.
      *>
      *> W - THE WIDTH LADDER, MEASURED AGAINST GR4'S OWN FLOOR rather than a convention.
      *>     The closing sentence makes a width WRONG if it cannot hold the picture's range:
      *>       S9(2)  -> max 99;                   1 byte holds -128..127        -> 1 suffices.
      *>       S9(4)  -> max 9 999;                1 byte cannot, 2 (32 767) can -> 2.
      *>       S9(9)  -> max 999 999 999;          2 cannot, 4 (2 147 483 647) can -> 4.
      *>       S9(18) -> max 10**18 - 1;           4 cannot, 8 (2**63 - 1 =
      *>                                           9 223 372 036 854 775 807) can -> 8.
      *>       S9(19) -> max 10**19 - 1;           8 CANNOT (10**19-1 > 2**63-1)  -> 16.
      *>     1/2/4/8/16 is therefore the SMALLEST byte ladder GR4 permits at these digit
      *>     counts, and FUNCTION BYTE-LENGTH (§15.14.1 "an integer equal to the length of the
      *>     argument in bytes") reports it. The S9(19) leg is the one that fails on the
      *>     common "8 bytes for everything from 10 digits up" shortcut.
      *> SIGN - the width is SIGN-INDEPENDENT: S9(4) and 9(4) both answer 2. GR4 leaves this
      *>     to the implementor; COBOL.NET's determination sets the boundary by the SIGNED
      *>     worst case so one picture never splits into two widths (the GR21 precedent, which
      *>     pins SIGNED and UNSIGNED to one length for the fixed-width binary usages).
      *> ALIGN - GR4's "alignment" obligation. COBOL.NET's determination is NO alignment: the
      *>     binary leaf begins at the next byte and no implicit FILLER is generated, so
      *>     X(1) + S9(4) BINARY + X(1) is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. An implementation aligning the
      *>     binary item to a 2-byte boundary answers 6 (1 + pad 1 + 2 + 1 + pad 1).
      *> BE - GR4's "representation ... including the representation of any algebraic sign".
      *>     Two's complement, MOST SIGNIFICANT BYTE FIRST. -1234 in 16 bits is
      *>     65 536 - 1234 = 64 302 = X"FB2E", so the group image holds X"FB" then X"2E".
      *>     FUNCTION ORD is 1-based (§15.70.1 "The lowest ordinal position is 1") and the
      *>     native alphanumeric ordinal of a character is its code unit + 1, so the two bytes
      *>     read 251+1 = 252 and 46+1 = 47. A little-endian implementation answers "47 252".
      *>     The bytes are reached through a group move to an alphanumeric item, which
      *>     §14.9.25.4 GR4 makes a byte transfer ("treated exactly as if it were an
      *>     alphanumeric to alphanumeric elementary move"), never a numeric conversion.
      *> RT - the same bytes decode back to the same value and leave the neighbours intact.
