      *> kb/Work R10 (Phase-B F73/F74/F75) - unsigned COMP-5 carriers own the full container range.
      *> Derived from ISO/IEC 1989:2023:
      *>   15.43.4 r2 - HIGHEST-ALGEBRAIC returns "the positive algebraic value of greatest finite
      *>                magnitude that may be represented in argument-1"; the 15.43.4 NOTE table's
      *>                BINARY-CHAR UNSIGNED row (+255 on an 8-bit container) fixes the container-range
      *>                reading for the fixed-width binary usages, and COMP-5's documented representation
      *>                (13.18.60.4 GR12; CONFORMANCE.md) is the same full-container rule:
      *>                8-byte (10-18 digits) -> 2^64-1; 16-byte (19-31 digits) -> 2^128-1 unsigned,
      *>                2^127-1 signed (LOWEST -2^127, 15.58.4 r2).
      *>   14.9.25.4 GR6d2b - an unsigned receiver stores the absolute value, no operational sign.
      *>   14.7.5 - the size error condition. F74's shift-mask bug collapsed the 16-byte container
      *>                range to [0,1) unsigned / empty signed, so EVERY checked 16-byte store reported
      *>                size error; the fixed boundary fires only genuinely (at the max: ADD 1 = SIZE,
      *>                SUBTRACT 1 = NOSIZE). The documented native intermediate is Int128
      *>                (8.8.1.3 implementor-defined; CONFORMANCE.md): reading an operand beyond it
      *>                raises the size error condition rather than silently wrapping.
