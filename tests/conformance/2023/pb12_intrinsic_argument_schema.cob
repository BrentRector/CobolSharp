      *> THE PER-POSITION ARGUMENT SCHEMA (fix-queue PB12/PB30/PB31).
      *>
      *> The ISO 15.3 class screen carried ONE kind per FUNCTION, so a function
      *> whose positions differ in class could not be screened at all without
      *> rejecting legal source. 15.37.3 is the clearest case: r1 makes
      *> argument-1 "a data item or literal of class alphabetic, alphanumeric,
      *> or national", r2 makes argument-2 the same family, and r3 makes
      *> argument-3 "an integer data item or integer literal". A single-kind row
      *> would have screened argument-3 as a string and REFUSED the legal call.
      *>
      *> THIS GOLDEN IS THE ACCEPT SIDE, and it is the half that matters most:
      *> the PB1 disaster was a screen that rejected 12 legal corpus programs,
      *> so every row here is legal COBOL that must keep compiling AND keep
      *> computing the right value. The reject side is pinned by the three
      *> pb12-* / pb31-* negative fixtures.
