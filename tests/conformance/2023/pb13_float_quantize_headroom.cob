      *> (receiver integer digits + 9) decimal digits and Int128 supplies only ~38, so a 31-digit receiver is two
      *> digits short. PB5 fixed one instance and recorded the clamp as "unreachable from a declarable receiver";
      *> that premise is false twice - PictureAnalyzer caps digits at 31 (CA33), so PIC 9(31) is legal, and the
      *> clamp fires at the FUNCTION's quantization point, before any store, so it needs no receiver at all.

      *> Int128.MaxValue/10**9 is not an approximation of it - it is wrong by a factor of about fifteen.

      *> CASE 2 - the receiver-free half, and the sharper one. A relation operand renders under
