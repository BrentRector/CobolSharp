      *> kb/Work PB837 - EACH implicit input-output operation of a
      *> SORT/MERGE transfer offers ITS OWN I-O status to the USE procedure.
      *>
      *> ISO 14.9.40.4 GR12 (SORT USING): a) "as if an OPEN statement",
      *> b) "Each record is obtained as if a READ statement with the NEXT
      *> phrase, the IGNORING LOCK phrase, and the AT END phrase had been
      *> executed", c) "as if a CLOSE statement without optional phrases",
      *> and the closing paragraph: "These implicit functions are performed
      *> such that any applicable USE procedures are executed".  14.9.24.4
      *> GR7 is the same rule for MERGE; 14.9.40.4 GR15 (GIVING) performs
      *> each record "as if a WRITE statement without any optional phrases".
      *> 14.9.49.4 GR6 runs the USE procedure "upon the unsuccessful
      *> execution of an input-output operation unless an AT END or INVALID
      *> KEY phrase takes precedence" - so three as-if statements that fail
      *> are three declarative invocations, each seeing its own status
      *> (9.1.13.1: the status is set "prior to the execution of ... any
      *> applicable exception processing statements").
      *>
      *> LEGS 1 AND 2 (USING, SORT then MERGE).  The input connector's
      *> file-control entry has SHARING WITH ALL OTHER, so the implicit
      *> OPEN carries SHARING WITH READ ONLY (GR12 a / GR7 a), and another
      *> connector holds the same physical file open EXTEND: Table 19 row
      *> "SHARING WITH READ ONLY / INPUT" x "sharing with all other /
      *> extend" is an unsuccessful open, 9.1.13.9 item 1 => '61'.  '61' is
      *> NONFATAL, so "the SORT statement continues as if the exception
      *> condition did not exist" (GR12 a; MERGE GR7 a continues after a
      *> USE procedure that completes normally).  The as-if READ then meets
      *> a connector that is not open: 14.9.30.4 GR2 - "the execution of
      *> the READ statement is unsuccessful and the I-O status value for
      *> file-name-1 is set to '47'" - which is not the at end condition,
      *> so the AT END phrase does not take precedence and the USE
      *> procedure runs.  The retrieval ends there (it is unsuccessful),
      *> and the as-if CLOSE of a connector that is not open is
      *> unsuccessful with '42' (14.9.6.4 GR1) - a third invocation.
      *> EXPECTED per leg: 61, 47, 42, then no record from that file.
      *>
      *> LEG 3 (GIVING).  The GIVING file is LINE SEQUENTIAL and the middle
      *> sorted record holds X"01", outside the line sequential character
      *> set (Annex A.1 item 115, docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-115: U+0020
      *> and above).  14.9.51.4 GR23: "the execution of the WRITE statement
      *> is unsuccessful and the I-O status ... is set to '71'" - one USE
      *> invocation with '71', and since '71' is not an attempt to write
      *> outside the file's boundaries the transfer goes on (the GR15
      *> boundary paragraph is the only one that ends it) - "C" is still
      *> written, and the as-if CLOSE succeeds without a declarative.
      *> EXPECTED: one 71, then the file reads back A and C.
      *>
      *> Every invocation displays a running sequence number, so the ORDER
      *> is part of the expected output.
