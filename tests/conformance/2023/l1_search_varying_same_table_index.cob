      *> ISO §14.9.37.4 GR3 c) 1 — "If index-name-1 is specified in the
      *> INDEXED BY phrase in the OCCURS clause associated with
      *> identifier-1, the index referenced by index-name-1 IS the
      *> search index." Not an extra varied index: the search index
      *> itself, which displaces the GR3a default.
      *> The table is INDEXED BY IX1 IX2 and holds 1..5. IX1 (the GR3a
      *> default) is pre-set to 5 and IX2 to 2, and the statement is
      *> SEARCH WS-E VARYING IX2. Three consequences follow and all
      *> three are printed:
      *>   the scan STARTS from IX2's value (GR4 reads the search
      *>   index's initial setting: 2, not IX1's 5);
      *>   it ENDS at the matching occurrence (GR1a: IX2 = 4);
      *>   IX1 is UNCHANGED (GR3's closing sentence: 5).
      *> Had IX1 remained the search index the scan would have begun at
      *> occurrence 5 and run off the end, taking AT END.
