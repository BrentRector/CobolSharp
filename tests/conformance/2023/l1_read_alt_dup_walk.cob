      *> ISO §14.9.30.4 GR21 indexed rule f + GR27 — the sequential walk
      *> when the previous operation was a successful READ and the key
      *> of reference IS an alternate key that allows duplicates.
      *> f.1 "If NEXT is specified or implied, and there exists in the
      *>      physical file a record whose key value is equal to the
      *>      key of reference and whose logical position within the
      *>      set of duplicates is after the record that was made
      *>      available by that prior READ statement, the record within
      *>      the set of duplicates that is immediately after the
      *>      record that was made available by that prior READ
      *>      statement.  Otherwise, the first record in the physical
      *>      file whose key value is greater than the key of reference
      *>      value."
      *> f.2 is the mirror for PREVIOUS: the duplicate immediately
      *>      before, otherwise the LAST record of the greatest smaller
      *>      key.  (f.2's printed text is garbled — "is made
      *>      available." lands mid-sentence — but it mirrors f.1.)
      *> "Logical position within the set of duplicates" is fixed by
      *> GR26: duplicates are made available "in the same order, or, in
      *> the case of PREVIOUS, in the reverse order, in which they are
      *> released by execution of WRITE statements" — RELEASE order,
      *> NOT prime-key order.  The records below are therefore released
      *> OUT of prime order (03, 01, 04, 02) so the two orders differ:
      *> release order among the XX duplicates is 03, 01, 02.
      *> GR27 sets the I-O status to '02' on a successful sequential
      *> read whose key of reference is an alternate record key when
      *> a) the FOLLOWING record duplicates that key (NEXT), or
      *> b) the record immediately PRECEDING it does (PREVIOUS).
      *>
      *> Alternate-key sequence (alt value, release order):
      *>     XX/03  XX/01  XX/02  YY/04
      *> LEG A (NEXT):     03, 01, 02, 04 then at end — a prime-order
      *>   walk would give 01, 02, 03, 04 and a "next greater prime"
      *>   walk would leave 02 behind 04.  Statuses 02,02,00,00 are
      *>   GR27 a): only the last XX has no duplicate after it.
      *> LEG B (PREVIOUS): 04, 02, 01, 03 then at end — the exact
      *>   reverse (GR26).  B2 is f.2's "otherwise" arm: the LAST
      *>   record of the XX duplicate set, not its first.  Statuses
      *>   00,02,02,00 are GR27 b).
