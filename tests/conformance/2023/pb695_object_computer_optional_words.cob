      *> the omission semantics-preserving). Each clause here is written with every one of them left
      *> out, which is the shortest conforming spelling of the paragraph:
      *>     CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM-DEFAULT           (CHARACTER and IS omitted)
      *>     SEQUENCE ALPHANUMERIC IS REV            (PROGRAM, COLLATING and FOR omitted)
      *> Before PB695 the grammar demanded CHARACTER, PROGRAM and FOR; `OBJECT-COMPUTER. SEQUENCE IS
      *> REV.` was a parse error at the word SEQUENCE.
      *> DERIVATION of the expected lines:
      *>  . 12.3.6.4 9): "When the PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE clause is specified, the initial
      *>    alphanumeric program collating sequence is the collating sequence associated with
      *>    alphabet-name-1", and 8.8.4.2.7 compares alphanumeric operands under the alphanumeric
      *>    program collating sequence in effect. AL-REV is declared by the
      *>    12.3.7.2 ALPHABET clause as `"Z" THRU "A"`, whose 12.3.7.4 reading assigns the characters
      *>    of the native set the ordinal positions of that reversed range - so within this program
      *>    "A" collates AFTER "Z" and the first comparison is FALSE while the second is TRUE.
      *>  . The comparison is unaffected by the CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION clause, which governs the
      *>    locale used for class conditions and case conversion (Annex A.4.9 item 7), not the
      *>    program collating sequence. It is written here to prove the CHARACTER-omitted spelling
      *>    reaches the binder as the clause it is.
