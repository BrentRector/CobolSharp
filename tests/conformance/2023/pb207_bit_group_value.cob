      *> kb/Work PB207 - the 13.18.63.4 GR5 group-VALUE AREA of a BIT GROUP, in BOOLEAN POSITIONS.
      *> 13.18.29.4 GR1 a) makes a GROUP-USAGE BIT group "a bit group and also a bit data item; its class and
      *> category are boolean", and GR1 b) describes it "as though it were an elementary data item of usage bit
      *> and class and category boolean described with PICTURE 1(m), where m is the bit length of the group".
      *> So GR5's "the group area is initialized without consideration for the individual elementary or group
      *> items contained within this group" deposits m BOOLEAN POSITIONS, laid out by the 8.5.1.6.3 walk - not
      *> the ceil(m/8) CHARACTERS the group occupies.  13.18.63.3 SR13 admits the operand (a boolean literal is
      *> "of the same category as the group item"); SR10 caps it at "the size of the group item", so no leg here
      *> writes a literal longer than its group.
      *> GR7 sends the literal through 14.6.8, and the arm is the RECEIVING category's: 14.6.8.6 for category
      *> boolean - "transferred ... into the corresponding boolean positions of the receiving data item, with
      *> ZERO FILL or truncation to the right".  ZERO, not the space 14.6.8.5 gives an alphanumeric area; leg 3
      *> is the leg that tells the two arms apart.
      *> BEFORE: every program below was REFUSED by name (COBOLNET0899).  Before that refusal the multi-member
      *> shape CRASHED the compiler (ArgumentOutOfRangeException out of GroupValueSlicer.SliceInit, slicing a
      *> 1-character area for two members that each occupy ceil(2/8) = 1 character) and the single-member shape
      *> stored ONE boolean position where the literal has four.
      *> EVERY VALUE-BEARING LEG IS PAIRED WITH ITS MEMBER-WISE CONTROL (the byte-identical group whose members
      *> carry their own VALUEs instead).  The claim is not "some bits came out" but "the group-level VALUE and
      *> the member-wise spelling of the same storage give the SAME answer" - a control that drifts is the
      *> failure this file exists to catch.
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, COMPUTED FROM THE SPEC BEFORE THE CONFIRMING RUN.  m is 8.5.1.6.3's cursor walk: a
      *> bit item "immediately following an elementary bit data item or bit group item of the same level" goes
      *> at the next bit position (the only byte-sharing case); any other goes at "the first bit position of the
      *> first available byte"; and the NOTE under the trailing-filler rule excludes "a record that is entirely
      *> a bit group", so a bit group keeps its EXACT extent.
