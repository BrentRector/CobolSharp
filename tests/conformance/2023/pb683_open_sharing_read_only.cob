      *> ISO §9.1.15 — "The SHARING phrase on an OPEN statement overrides
      *> the SHARING clause in the file control entry for establishing the
      *> sharing mode."  A connector whose SELECT declares NEITHER a SHARING
      *> clause NOR a LOCK MODE clause is therefore open FOR FILE SHARING
      *> when its own OPEN statement writes SHARING WITH READ ONLY, and
      *> §9.1.15 item 2 says of that mode "Record locks are in effect".
      *> §9.1.16 — "While locked by a given file connector, a record is not
      *> accessible to another file connector in the same or a different run
      *> unit, except by the execution of a READ statement with the IGNORING
      *> LOCK phrase."  So the READ below is refused, and §14.9.30.4 GR9/GR10
      *> b) price the refusal: "A value is placed into the I-O status
      *> associated with file-name-1 to indicate the record operation
      *> conflict condition" — '51' (§9.1.13.8 item 1), and no record is made
      *> available (GR10 c).
      *>
      *> ⛔ WHY THIS GOLDEN EXISTS (kb/Work PB683).  Every operand of that
      *> derivation is a RUN-TIME fact.  The emitter used to decide record-
      *> lock governance from the file control entry and the statement's own
      *> phrases — both compile-time facts — and routed an unphrased READ on
      *> a connector like B or C to an UNGOVERNED runtime entry, which
      *> answered '00' and handed over a record another connector had locked.
      *> Leg C is the discriminator that made the defect unmistakable: RETRY
      *> 0 TIMES is a behavioural NO-OP by §14.7.9.3 GR4 a) — "If the RETRY
      *> phrase is not specified or the result of the evaluation of
      *> arithmetic-expression-1 or arithmetic-expression-2 is negative or
      *> zero, the statement is unsuccessful" — yet writing it changed the
      *> answer from '00' to '51', because the compile-time predicate could
      *> see the RETRY phrase and could not see the OPEN's SHARING phrase.
      *> B and C shall now agree, on all three organizations.
      *>
      *> Each leg is one physical file with two connectors.  A carries the
      *> clauses (SHARING WITH ALL OTHER needs a LOCK MODE clause by
      *> §14.9.27.3 SR8) and locks the first record with an explicit WITH
      *> LOCK phrase, legal under MANUAL locking (§12.4.5.9 GR5).  B and C
      *> carry NO sharing or locking clause at all and become sharing
      *> participants only through their own OPEN statement.  Table 19
      *> permits the opens: A is INPUT, and §9.1.15 item 2 refuses a READ
      *> ONLY connector only when another connector's "open mode is other
      *> than input".
