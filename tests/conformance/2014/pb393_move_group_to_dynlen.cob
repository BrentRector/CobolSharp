      *> kb/Work PB393. ISO 1989:2023 14.9.25.4 GR8: "If the sending or receiving item is a dynamic-length
      *> elementary item, the current content of the dynamic-length elementary item is moved or changed as
      *> specified in 8.5.1.10.4, Operations on dynamic-length elementary items." And 8.5.1.10.4: "If a
      *> dynamic-length elementary item is a receiving operand and is not reference-modified, the new value
      *> becomes the content of the item. The new length of the dynamic-length elementary item is determined by
      *> the length of new content", with "If the maximum length is reached, the value is truncated on the
      *> right as necessary."
      *> Neither operand is a variable-length GROUP here, so 14.9.25.3 SR9 and GR9 do not apply at all: the
      *> sender is a plain fixed group (14.9.25.4 GR4's group move) and the receiver is a bare dynamic-length
      *> item. A= the whole 5-character group image with the new length 5; B= the same image truncated on the
      *> right to the LIMIT 3, length 3.
      *> Before this fixture the ONE dynamic-length store lived in the MOVE conversion path, which only
      *> MoveKind.Convert reaches; a GROUP sender routes to the group-to-elementary renderer, which asked for a
      *> whole-group character image the receiver does not have and ABORTED the run unit.
