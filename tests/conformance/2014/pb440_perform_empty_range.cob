      *> kb/Work PB440 - PERFORM of an EMPTY procedure range, at --std 2014. The full derivation and both
      *> measured arms are in tests/conformance/2023/pb440_perform_empty_range.cob; this is the 2014
      *> WITNESS, because the rule is edition-INDEPENDENT and the defect had no edition arm.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE SPEC AND NOT FROM A RUN:
      *> 14.4.2  - "A section consists of a section header followed by zero, one, or more successive
      *>            paragraphs", so EMPTY-SEC is legal and 14.9.28.4 GR4's specified set is empty.
      *> GR4     - "An inline PERFORM statement and an out-of-line PERFORM statement function identically":
      *>            the two VARYING phrases below are the same phrase written both ways => same answer.
      *> GR13 a) - all induction variables are set to their initialization values BEFORE any transfer, so
      *>            VALUE 7 is erased: A=1,B=1 at entry.
      *> GR13 e) - B walks 1,2,3 and resets to 1 as A is augmented; the statement ends with A=4, B=1.
      *> GR5     - an empty set has no first statement, so no transfer takes place and TAIL-SEC never runs;
      *>            GR8 (the set executed once) and GR9 (three times) both leave N=0.
      *> ⛔ THE INLINE TWIN'S BODY IS `CONTINUE`, AND THAT IS THE RULE, NOT A CONCESSION (kb/Work PB396).
      *> 14.9.28.2 Format 2 prints `PERFORM [ times|until|varying ] imperative-statement-1 END-PERFORM`
      *> with imperative-statement-1 UNBRACKETED, and 5.2.6.2 gives the omission licence to BRACKETED
      *> portions only — so the standard offers NO inline spelling of an empty imperative-statement-1.
      *> The EMPTY procedure RANGE this program is about is an out-of-line fact (14.4.2 lets a section
      *> consist of zero paragraphs); its GR4 inline twin is a body that DOES NOTHING, which 14.9.9 spells
      *> CONTINUE — "a no operation" — so the loop's induction-variable behaviour, and this program's
      *> expected output, are unchanged. Written empty, the statement parsed only because the grammar
      *> said `statementBlock*`; it is now COBOLNET2072.
