      *> kb/Work PB965 (finisher) - A VARIABLE-LENGTH GROUP ARGUMENT INTO A FIXED-LENGTH GROUP FORMAL OF A
      *> METHOD, and both mixed RETURNING pairs of an INVOKE.
      *>
      *> The INVOKE twin of pb965_vlg_into_fixed_boundary. 14.8.2.2: "If either the formal parameter or the
      *> argument is a variable length group, the formal parameter and the argument shall be compatible, as
      *> described in 8.5.1.12"; 14.8.3.2 says the same of a RETURNING pair and applies its length rule only
      *> when "neither of them is strongly typed or a variable length group". The compiler refused both
      *> RETURNING pairs (COBOLNET0828, "character length mismatch (formal 7, argument 5)") by comparing the
      *> variable-length group's collapsed width.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED:
      *>   LF   - VT has capacity 2 opposite LF's 3-occurrence LT; 14.6.9.2 space fills the third -> [ghkl ij].
      *>   SG   - the method's variable-length returning item LR (capacity 3) into the fixed SG (8.5.1.12.3).
      *>   VG   - 14.2.3 GR8: L1 := qq and LT(1..3) := m n o reach VG. DETERMINATION: a formal with a FIXED
      *>          occurrence count cannot change the argument table's capacity, so VCAP stays 2 and the third
      *>          occurrence the formal stored has no storage in VG.
      *>   VG2  - the second method returns a FIXED item into VG: its 3 occurrences become VT at capacity 3.
