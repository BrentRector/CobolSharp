      *> ISO §15.40.3 r5 — FORMATTED-DATETIME's argument-4 MAGNITUDE bound, both arms.
      *> "Argument-4 is an integer specifying the offset from UTC expressed in minutes. If argument-4 is
      *> specified, the magnitude of the value shall be less than or equal to 1439."
      *> (cite.py --check 15.40.3 "the magnitude of the value shall be less than or equal to 1439" -> OK,
      *> §15.40.3 rule 5.) The clause's own NOTE explains the number: "The offset value 1439 represents
      *> 23 hours 59 minutes, which is one minute less than a day."
      *>
      *> ⛔ THE RULE'S OBLIGATION IS THE EXCEPTION, NOT A VALUE. §15.3 item 14: an argument that "results in
      *> an incorrect value for that argument ... according to the rules specified in the function
      *> definition" sets EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION; the RESULT is implementor-defined and only when checking is
      *> not enabled. So this program turns checking ON and asserts the exception. Enforced NOWHERE before
      *> kb/Work PB11 landed CobolDate.OffsetOutOfRange: 2000 minutes rendered offset-hours 33 and 9999
      *> rendered 166, both violating §15.3.3.6.2 ("The offset-hours subfield ... shall contain a value from
      *> 00 to 23 inclusive") and the second one overflowing the width the format describes — a fabricated
      *> value with no exception condition, never mere over-acceptance.
      *>
      *> THE FORMAT IS AN OFFSET FORMAT, which is what §15.40.3 r6 requires before argument-4 may be written
      *> at all (its violation is conformance:negative/l1-formatted-datetime-offset-local-format). §15.40.4
      *> r3 then fixes the expectation without any arithmetic: "the value in argument-3 is reflected DIRECTLY
      *> in the time portion of the returned value, and the offset in argument-4 is reflected DIRECTLY in the
      *> offset portion" — so the time never moves and only the offset field changes across the five probes.
      *>
      *> Hand-derived values. Integer date 153569 is 2021-06-16 (§15.5.2 epoch 1601-01-01 = 1, as
      *> 2014/formatted_datetime pins); 45296 seconds is 12:34:56 (§15.5.5). §15.3.3.6.1 gives the EXTENDED
      *> offset subformat as "six characters: a plus sign; two lowercase 'h' characters representing the
      *> offset-hours subfield; a colon character; and two lowercase 'm' characters representing the
      *> offset-minutes subfield", and its later paragraph fixes probe 3's sign: "If the values contained in
      *> offset-hours and offset-minutes subfields of data in a receiving field associated with an offset
      *> subformat are both zero, the position corresponding to the plus sign in the format shall contain a
      *> plus sign" — so a zero offset renders "+00:00", not "-00:00" and not "000:00":
