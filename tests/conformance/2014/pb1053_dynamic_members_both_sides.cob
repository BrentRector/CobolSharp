      *> kb/Work PB1053 - a record whose dynamic-length members sit on
      *> BOTH sides of a fixed member (and side by side) round-trips
      *> through every organization that frames its records, and through
      *> the sort. The record is sent as its contiguous image (ISO
      *> 8.5.1.11.2), so "AA" "KEY" "CCCC" and "AAKEY" "CCC" "C" are the
      *> same characters; the frame carries each member's length beside
      *> the record (determination D-FRA (v), docs/CONFORMANCE.md section
      *> 3), and a READ / RETURN into the same description gives every
      *> member back the content it was written with (8.5.1.10.4: "the
      *> new value becomes the content of the item"). The keys below
      *> follow a dynamic member and precede another; the trailing FILLER
      *> keeps each key's furthest reach within the minimum record size
      *> (14.9.40.3 SR6 g; 12.4.5.12.3 SR4), and each key is found at the
      *> position the record's own member lengths give it (14.9.30.4 GR32;
      *> 14.9.40.4 GR8).
