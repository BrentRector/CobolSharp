      *> ISO §15.48.3 r1 — "Argument-1 shall be a national or alphanumeric
      *> literal": the NATIONAL alternative, which nothing in the corpus exercised.
      *>
      *> ⛔ THE RULE NAMES TWO CLASSES AND ONE SHAPE, and only the alphanumeric
      *> class was ever written. Every existing INTEGER-OF-FORMATTED-DATE golden
      *> passes an alphanumeric literal, and the two negative fixtures around this
      *> function both constrain ARGUMENT-2 (r3), so the national arm of r1 has
      *> never been contradicted — a rule half-exercised reads as enforced. Both
      *> alternatives are written here, side by side, and must return the SAME
      *> integer: the class of the format literal changes how the argument is
      *> spelled, never what date it denotes.
      *>
      *> §15.48.3 r3 — "Argument-2 shall be a data item of the same type as
      *> argument-1" — forces the pairing: an alphanumeric format takes a PIC X
      *> item, a national format a PIC N item. (The mismatched pairing is already
      *> pinned the other way by negative/pb58-iofd-national.)
      *>
      *> THE VALUE, from §15.48.4 r1 ("the integer date form equivalent of the date
      *> represented by argument-2 when analyzed according to argument-1") over
      *> §15.5.2 ("a number of days succeeding December 31, 1600", starting date
      *> Monday, January 1, 1601): 1995-02-15 is 143,950 days after 1601-01-01, so
      *> its integer date form is 143951. "YYYYMMDD" is the §15.3.1.2 basic
      *> calendar date format in both classes — the format's eight characters are
      *> 'Y','M','D' letters, which the national character repertoire contains.
