      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §8.4.3.2 — a function-identifier written with FUNCTION-POINTER-NAME-1, the consumer
      *> SET Format 8 (kb/Work PB452) landed without. kb/Work PB847.
      *>
      *> §8.4.3.2.2 — the function-identifier's name is function-pointer-name-1, function-prototype-name-1 or
      *>   intrinsic-function-name-1; §8.4.3.2.3 SR4 — "Function-pointer-name-1 shall be defined as a
      *>   function-pointer data item"; SR2 — with function-pointer-name-1 "the word FUNCTION may be omitted";
      *>   SR5 — "If function-pointer-name-1 is specified, the parentheses shall be specified."
      *> §8.4.3.2.4 GR1 — the result's description is that of the RETURNING item "of the function prototype
      *>   identified by the TO phrase of the USAGE clause in the definition of function-pointer-name-1".
      *> §8.4.3.2.4 GR4 — that prototype determines "the characteristics of the activated element", and GR6c —
      *>   "the runtime system attempts to execute the function at the address pointed to by
      *>   function-pointer-name-1. If function-pointer-name-1 is NULL, the EC-FUNCTION-PTR-NULL exception
      *>   condition is set to exist, no function is activated".
      *> §14.9.39.4 GR14 — SET Format 8 stores a same-signature function's address; PBTRP has PBDBP's signature.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, derived line by line:
      *>   A=000000010  FP holds PBDBP's address; FUNCTION FP(5) activates it: 5 * 2.
      *>   B=000000015  FP re-SET to PBTRP (same signature, GR14); FP(5) — FUNCTION omitted (SR2) — activates
      *>                the function the pointer HOLDS (GR6c), not the prototype its TO phrase names: 5 * 3.
      *>   C=IF         FP(2) = 6 in an IF condition (the per-evaluation activation path): 2 * 3 = 6.
      *>   D=3          PERFORM VARYING I FROM 1 UNTIL FP(I) > 7 — the condition is evaluated before each pass
      *>                (§14.9.28.4), activating PBTRP each time: 3, 6, 9 — so the loop stops with I = 3.
      *>   Z=000000077  FUNCTION FZ() — a zero-argument function through a pointer; SR5's parentheses written.
      *>   H: EC-FUNCTION-PTR-NULL  FP is SET TO NULL; FP(5) raises GR6c's condition (checking is ON), and the
      *>                declarative associated with it runs (GR6f), reporting it through EXCEPTION-STATUS …
      *>   AFTER        … and RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT continues after the statement that raised it (§14.9.33.4
      *>                GR2 a) 2.).
