      *> kb/Work PB329 - THE IMPLEMENTOR-DEFINED LINE SEQUENTIAL
      *> CHARACTER SET (Annex A.1 item 115, required + documented;
      *> the determination is docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-115: the
      *> set is every character whose code point is U+0020 or above).
      *> ONE set, three rules, and this golden walks all three plus
      *> the boundary:
      *>
      *>   14.9.30.4 GR16 - "If the execution of the READ statement is
      *>   successful but the record area contains one or more
      *>   characters not in the implementor-defined character set for
      *>   a line sequential file, the I-O status in the read file
      *>   connector is set to '09'." (9.1.13.2 item 7 says the same
      *>   from the status side.)  R1 below.
      *>
      *>   14.9.51.4 GR23 - "For a line sequential file, if the record
      *>   area contains one or more characters that are not in the
      *>   implementor-defined character set defined for a line
      *>   sequential file, the execution of the WRITE statement is
      *>   unsuccessful and the I-O status in the write file connector
      *>   is set to '71'."  W2 below.
      *>
      *>   14.9.35.4 GR17 d) - the same sentence for REWRITE.  X2.
      *>
      *>   9.1.13.10 item 1 adds that after a '71' "the write or
      *>   rewrite operation was unsuccessful and the record area
      *>   remains unchanged" - proved by re-reading the file and
      *>   finding only the records the successful writes released.
      *>
      *> HOW A BAD CHARACTER GETS ONTO THE MEDIUM AT ALL: all three
      *> rules are organization-scoped ("for a line sequential file"),
      *> so a RECORD sequential connector carries no such rule and its
      *> print stream frames the record with CR/LF. Writing an extract
      *> or print file and reading it back under a different
      *> description is exactly the idiom 9.1.13.2's warning statuses
      *> exist for.
