      *> kb/Work PB965 (finisher) - A VARIABLE-LENGTH GROUP ARGUMENT INTO A FIXED-LENGTH GROUP FORMAL, and
      *> the mixed RETURNING pair, on an AS NESTED CALL.
      *>
      *> 14.8.2.2: "If either the formal parameter or the argument is a variable length group, the formal
      *> parameter and the argument shall be compatible, as described in 8.5.1.12". 14.8.2.2 rule 1 (the
      *> formal "shall be described with the same number or a smaller number of bytes as the corresponding
      *> argument") binds the fixed side, and 8.5.1.12.3 sets the lengths it compares: "For purposes of
      *> determining compatibility, the dynamic-capacity table is considered to be the same length as the
      *> corresponding table". VG's VT corresponds to LF's 3-occurrence LT, so VG counts 2+3+2 = 7 against
      *> LF's 7. The compiler used to compare VG's collapsed width (5, one element for VT) and refuse this
      *> source (COBOLNET1688), and the two RETURNING pairs too (COBOLNET1736) - although 14.8.3.2 applies
      *> its length rule only when "neither of them is strongly typed or a variable length group".
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED:
      *>   LF   - VT has capacity 2 opposite a 3-occurrence table; 14.6.9.2 fits it: the missing third
      *>          occurrence is space filled -> [ghkl ij].
      *>   VG   - 14.2.3 GR8 ("operates as if the formal parameter occupies the same storage area as the
      *>          argument"): L1 := qq reaches V1. DETERMINATION: a formal with a FIXED occurrence count
      *>          cannot change the argument table's current capacity, so VCAP stays 2.
      *>   LC   - BY CONTENT, the same view; the callee's MOVE never reaches VG (14.2.3 GR9).
      *>   LP   - a table-less formal of 2 characters is a PREFIX (14.8.2.2 rule 1); VT lies past its last
      *>          character (8.5.1.12.2's last sentence). P1 := PP reaches V1 and the rest of VG survives.
      *>   VG2  - RETURNING a FIXED item into VG: RT's 3 occurrences become VT at capacity 3 (8.5.1.12.3).
      *>   SG   - RETURNING a variable-length item into a fixed SG: WT's 3 occurrences fill ST.
