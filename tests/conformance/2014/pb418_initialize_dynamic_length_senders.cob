      *> kb/Work PB418 / PB415 — ⚖ DETERMINATION D-DL1 (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §3): ISO 14.9.20.4 GR7, "When a
      *> dynamic-length elementary item is initialized, its length is set to zero", is the GR6c arm's rule, not
      *> a post-pass over all three sending-operand arms. The sibling golden initialize_dynamic_length pins the
      *> GR6c pole (a bare INITIALIZE); this one pins the two poles GR7 must NOT reach, and the ordering between
      *> them. Every expected value below is derived from the rules, not measured:
      *>   L1 GR6a3 — "The actual sending-operand is a literal that, when moved to the receiving-operand with a
      *>      MOVE statement, produces the same result as the initial value of the data item as produced by the
      *>      application of the VALUE clause" — and 8.6.4, "When the data description entry of a dynamic-length
      *>      elementary item contains a VALUE clause, the rules of the VALUE clause define the length of that
      *>      item in its initial state". DV's initial state is 5 characters "hello", so TO VALUE restores 05.
      *>   L2 14.9.20.3 SR8 — "If the REPLACING phrase is specified, literal-1 or the data item referenced by
      *>      identifier-2 is the sending operand." The sender is the 3-character "ABC", so DN takes 03.
      *>   L3 GR6c gives an alphanumeric receiver "Figurative constant alphanumeric SPACES", whose length is one
      *>      character by 8.3.3.6.4 GR3b; GR7 is what makes it 00 instead — 13.18.19.4 GR1's minimum.
      *>   L4 8.3.3.6.4 GR3b again, from the VALUE side: a figurative VALUE other than ALL literal-1 is ONE
      *>      character, so DF's initial state is one space and GR6a3 restores 01 — NOT 00. This is the line
      *>      that separates D-DL1 from the unconditional reading most sharply.
      *>   L5 GR8 - elementary items of a group are initialized in definition order; DG takes its own VALUE
      *>      (GR6a3) and the fixed-length sibling FX takes its VALUE padded by the MOVE rules.
      *>   L6 GR5c is a disjunction tested in order: DV qualifies through GR5c1 (VALUE), so GR6a governs and the
      *>      DEFAULT phrase cannot overwrite it - 05 again.
      *>   L7 DN carries no VALUE clause, so GR5c1b and GR5c1c are both false; it qualifies through GR5c3
      *>      (DEFAULT) and GR6c + GR7 give 00.
      *> DYNAMIC LENGTH is COBOL-2014 (8.5.1.10 / 13.18.19); the negative below it is
      *> tests/conformance/negative/pb418-initialize-dynamic-length-2002.
