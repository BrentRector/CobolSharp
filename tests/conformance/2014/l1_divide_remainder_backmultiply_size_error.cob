      *> ISO §14.9.12.4 GR7 — "When native arithmetic is in effect, the remainder is the result of
      *> multiplying the subsidiary quotient and the divisor and subtracting the product from the
      *> dividend."
      *> (cite.py --check 14.9.12.4 "the remainder is the result of multiplying the subsidiary quotient and
      *> the divisor and subtracting the product from the dividend" -> OK, §14.9.12.4 General rules 7.)
      *>
      *> THE PRODUCT GR7 NAMES IS AN INTERMEDIATE, AND §14.7.5 GOVERNS IT. Case 5 of the SIZE ERROR
      *> phrase's list raises the size error condition "if native arithmetic is in effect and the
      *> implementor defines that the range of values allowed for the intermediate data item is to be
      *> checked" — this implementation checks exactly when an ON SIZE ERROR phrase makes the check
      *> observable. So a back-multiply that overflows the intermediate shall RAISE, never wrap.
      *>
      *> DERIVED BEFORE MEASURING. The operands satisfy §14.7.7 rule 2's composite of 12 + 14 = 26 digits,
      *> so the statement is legal and its receivers are in range — yet the product GR7 forms is
      *> (subsidiary quotient) × (divisor) ≈ 10**12 × 1, carried unscaled at 14 + 14 = 28 fraction digits,
      *> i.e. of the order 10**40, which no 128-bit integer intermediate can hold. The derived behaviour
      *> is therefore: the size error condition is raised, imperative-statement-1 runs, and identifier-4
      *> keeps its previous content — 7, printed with the receiver's own 9(12)V9(9) picture as
      *> 000000000007000000000 (a V-scaled item's display carries no decimal point).
      *>   OVF=SIZEERR BR=000000000007000000000
      *> The failure this discriminates is a silent wrap: an unchecked C# Int128 multiply produces a
      *> wrong remainder with no size error, takes the NOT ON SIZE ERROR arm, and prints OVF=NONE.

      *> EDITION. The 26-digit receiver needs the 2014 arithmetic range; the version matrix owns the gate
      *> below it.
