      *> kb/Work PB393. ISO 1989:2023 14.9.25.4 GR9a's table half - "Where two tables correspond, as specified
      *> in 8.5.1.12.2, Positional correspondence, the table in the sending group is moved to the corresponding
      *> table in the receiving group, as specified in 14.6.9.2, Moving a table" - in BOTH directions, because
      *> 8.5.1.12.1 admits a FIXED group as the other operand ("only one of the operands may be a
      *> variable-length group") and 8.5.1.12.3 says how: a corresponding table that is not dynamic-capacity
      *> "is treated as though it were a dynamic-capacity table whose capacity is ... its fixed number of
      *> occurrences", the same conversion 14.6.9.1 states for the operation itself.
      *>
      *> D= dynamic-to-dynamic. 14.6.9.2: "The operation recreates or overwrites the receiving table with a
      *>    copy of the sending table" - the receiving table's capacity becomes the sender's 2, whatever its
      *>    own FROM 1 seed was, so CB=2 and both elements arrive.
      *> F= dynamic-to-FIXED. 14.6.9.2 rule 2: "If the sending table has a lower current capacity than the
      *>    receiving table, all the remaining elements of the receiving table are space filled" - the sender
      *>    holds 2 elements, the receiving fixed table has 3, so FX-T(3) is spaces.
      *> R= FIXED-to-dynamic. The fixed table is a dynamic-capacity table of capacity 3 by 8.5.1.12.3, and
      *>    "recreates or overwrites the receiving table with a copy of the sending table" makes the receiving
      *>    dynamic table's capacity 3.
      *> X= the EXCESS PART. SFIX is a FIXED group with no table at all, and 8.5.1.12.2's last sentence
      *>    admits the pair anyway: "where the relative byte position of a dynamic capacity table in the
      *>    longer group is beyond the last character of the shorter group, the dynamic capacity table is
      *>    treated as if it corresponds to a space-filled fixed-length table". 14.9.25.4 GR9b step 2 then
      *>    sends RV-T to 14.6.9.4: "the current capacity of the dynamic table is unaffected, and each
      *>    element of the dynamic table is space-filled" - so the capacity stays 2 and both elements are
      *>    spaces. It is NOT recreated at capacity zero, which is what 14.6.9.2 would do for a sender that
      *>    really carried an empty table; the two cases are the same zero-length component and are told
      *>    apart by whether one was carried at all.
