      *> GR3: "When a sending operand is described with a standard
      *>   floating-point usage, and the content of the sending operand
      *>   would evaluate to true in an infinity class condition or to
      *>   true in a FLOAT-NOT-A-NUMBER class condition, the
      *>   EC-DATA-NOT-FINITE exception condition is set to exist,
      *>   except in the following circumstances: - a sending item is
      *>   referenced in a class condition, or - a sending item is
      *>   referenced in a sign condition, or - the sending and
      *>   receiving items in a MOVE statement are defined with the same
      *>   standard floating-point usage specification, with the
      *>   exception of endianness, or - a sending item is processed in
      *>   a VALIDATE statement."
