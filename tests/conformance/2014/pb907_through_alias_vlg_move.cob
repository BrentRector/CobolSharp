      *> kb/Work PB907 - A LEVEL-66 THROUGH ALIAS IS A GROUP ITEM ON EITHER SIDE OF A VARIABLE-LENGTH MOVE.
      *>
      *> 13.18.45.4 GR2: "When the THROUGH phrase is specified, data-name-1 defines an alphanumeric group
      *> item that includes all elementary items starting with data-name-2 ... and concluding with
      *> data-name-3". 14.9.25.4 GR9: "If both the sending operand and the receiving data item are group
      *> items and one or both is a variable-length group, the following rules apply". 14.9.25.3 SR9 makes
      *> the pair legal when the groups are compatible as specified in 8.5.1.12. SALIAS (S1 THRU S3) and
      *> DST are compatible: 8.5.1.12.2 "Two tables correspond if at least one of them is a dynamic-capacity
      *> table and they occupy the same relative byte positions within their groups" - ST and D1 both start
      *> at relative byte position 2 - and 8.5.1.12.3 "Two corresponding tables match when the byte length
      *> of their elements is equal" (1 and 1). This program used to be refused with "the sending operand
      *> is not a group item", which is false of an alias by GR2.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED:
      *>   L1 - GR9 a) (equal lengths: 8.5.1.12.3 makes D1 the same length as ST, so both are 7 bytes):
      *>        D0 takes "CD", D3 takes "EF", and 14.6.9.2 "recreates or overwrites the receiving table
      *>        with a copy of the sending table", so D1's capacity becomes 3 and its elements are TTT.
      *>   L2 - the reverse move into the alias: the receiving table ST is fixed-capacity, and 14.6.9.2
      *>        rule 2 "If the sending table has a lower current capacity than the receiving table, all
      *>        the remaining elements of the receiving table are space filled" - B1 holds 2 elements, so
      *>        ST becomes "ZW ". S1 takes "XY", S3 takes "UV", and S0 (outside the alias) keeps "AB".
      *>   L3 - the move's result is the same through the structural twin TG (a plain group with the
      *>        alias's layout) - the equivalence GR2 states.
