      *> kb/Work PB393. ISO 1989:2023 14.9.25.4 GR9 - "If both the sending operand and the receiving data item
      *> are group items and one or both is a variable-length group" - over three shapes. The operation is a
      *> STRUCTURAL walk over the two groups' 8.5.1.12 components, which the COMPARISON twin states outright
      *> (8.8.4.2.17: "when corresponding dynamic-length elementary items are encountered, the length is
      *> determined as described in 8.5.1.10.4 ... comparison continues with the next data item in each of the
      *> compatible groups"), so GR9a's "corresponding character position" is the position under 8.5.1.12.2's
      *> correspondence - the accounting in which a dynamic-length item is of zero length - and not the
      *> receiver's incidental current content length.
      *>
      *> E= GR9a, groups of EQUAL length (5 = 3+0+2 and 1+2+0+2, the dynamic item at relative byte 3 in both).
      *>    "The content of each character position that is not occupied by a corresponding table is moved to
      *>    the corresponding character position in the receiving group": the fixed run ABC|YZ lands as
      *>    RA=A, RC=BC, RB=YZ across DIFFERENT leaf boundaries, and the corresponding dynamic-length items
      *>    move per 8.5.1.10.4 ("the new value becomes the content"), R-D = PQRS.
      *> S= GR9b with the SENDING group SHORTER (fixed run 3 against 7): "each location that occupies the
      *>    excess part is space filled ... 3. All other character positions are filled with space characters"
      *>    - so TB, which lies wholly in the excess part, is four spaces while TA and T-D still take the
      *>    common part per GR9a.
      *> L= GR9b with the SENDING group LONGER (fixed run 7 against 3): "the character positions that occupy
      *>    the excess part are ignored by the operation" - UA takes MNO, U-D takes the dynamic content, and
      *>    the sender's trailing WXYZ is dropped.
      *> Z= 8.5.1.10.4's zero-length arm reached through GR9: "If the length of the sending operand is zero,
      *>    no data is moved and the new length of the dynamic-length elementary item is set to zero", so
      *>    FUNCTION LENGTH of the receiving dynamic item is 0 after a zero-length sender.
