      *> ISO 8.9 - the word PADDING as a USER-DEFINED word (kb/Work PB300).
      *> PADDING is a lexer token because the ANSI X3.23-1985 file-control PADDING
      *> CHARACTER clause spells it, but 8.9 reserves it at 85 and 2002 ONLY: it is
      *> absent from the 2023 reserved-word list (which runs PACKED-DECIMAL -> PAGE)
      *> and from the whole 2023 text, and reserved-words.json records r2014 false.
      *> So every one of these declarations and references is legal COBOL at 2014 and
      *> 2023, and each was a raw COBOL0001 parse error until PB300 made PADDING a
      *> reservation-gated cobolWord row - declining or deleting a clause may not cost
      *> the user the WORD.
      *>
      *> Three legs, because the fix has three surfaces:
      *>   W=   the plain name slot (cobolWord),
      *>   E1=/E2= a SUBSCRIPTED reference, which needs PADDING in the lexer's
      *>        _dataNameTokens trigger set or `PADDING (` never enters SUBSCRIPT mode,
      *>   Q=   qualification, so the word survives a two-name reference too.
      *> Expected output is read straight off the source: W= is the VALUE clause "ABC";
      *> E1= is the "PQ" moved into occurrence 1; E2= is occurrence 2, subscripted by a
      *> data item rather than a literal, holding the "RS" moved into it; Q= is the same
      *> scalar reached as PADDING OF WS-SCA.
