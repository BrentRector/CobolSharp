      *> kb/Work PB654 at COBOL-2014 -- ONE INITIAL EVALUATION, AND ONE 14.7.4.3 r7 GATE OVER IT, FOR EVERY
      *> FIXED-SCALE RECEIVER CATEGORY. ROUNDED MODE IS is a COBOL-2014 introduction, so this is the earliest
      *> edition that can state the defect at all (COBOLNET0803 below it -- the negative is
      *> tests/conformance/negative/pb653-nested-float-rounded-mode-below-2014).
      *>
      *> (1) THE DOUBLE EVALUATION. ArithmeticEmitter.StoreArith wrote the right-hand side's expression TWICE
      *> -- once into the r7 representability test and once into the store that follows. 14.7.7 rule 4 a) says
      *> "The initial evaluation of the statement is done and the result of this operation is placed in an
      *> intermediate data item" and rule 4 b) says "the intermediate data item is stored in or combined with
      *> and then stored in each single resulting data item": ONE evaluation, held, tested, then stored. For a
      *> function reference whose successive references are not the same value the second spelling is a second
      *> returned value -- 15.75.3 rule 5: "In each case, subsequent references without specifying argument-1
      *> return the next number in the current sequence" -- so the test examined one element and the store
      *> landed the NEXT one, and the gated statement consumed two elements of the sequence instead of one.
      *>
      *> (2) THE GATE'S MISSING ARMS. 14.7.4.3 rule 7: "If the PROHIBITED phrase is specified, and the
      *> arithmetic value cannot be represented exactly in the resultant identifier, the EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION
      *> exception condition is set to exist, the size error condition exists" -- and the receiver is left
      *> unchanged. CobolFloat.ToScaled lands a PROHIBITED transfer TRUNCATED by design, so the test must
      *> precede the store. Only the plain-numeric arm had it; the numeric-EDITED arm silently stored the
      *> truncated value (measured: SQRT(3) into PIC ZZ9.999 stored 1.732 and raised nothing).
      *>
      *> NO RAW PSEUDO-RANDOM VALUE IS PINNED HERE, deliberately -- 15.75.4 rule 2 promises only that "For a
      *> given seed value on a given implementation, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers will always be the
      *> same", which is exactly enough to compare the THIRD element of one seeded run against the element the
      *> next reference returns in another. A1 proves the measurement is not vacuous: consecutive elements of
      *> the sequence must differ, or "which element did I get" could not distinguish anything.
