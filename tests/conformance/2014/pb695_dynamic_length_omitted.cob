      *> !! THE DYNAMIC LENGTH CLAUSE'S OPTIONAL WORDS, OMITTED (kb/Work PB695 family 2).
      *> ISO 13.18.19.2, read off the printed page (PDF p427 / folio 397). The format is
      *>     DYNAMIC LENGTH [ dynamic-length-structure-name-1 ] [ LIMIT IS integer-1 ]
      *> and the underlines fall on DYNAMIC and LIMIT ALONE. LENGTH and IS are printed plain, so
      *> 8.3.2.4.3 makes `DYNAMIC LIMIT 30` the same clause as `DYNAMIC LENGTH LIMIT IS 30`; COBOL.NET
      *> required the LENGTH and answered COBOL0001. DYNAMIC stays the required anchor and heads no other
      *> data-description clause, so the relaxation adds no ambiguity, and the COBOL-2014 introduction
      *> gate keys on the CLAUSE context (VersionConformancePass.VisitDynamicLengthClause), not on the
      *> word - `--std 2002` still answers COBOLNET0900.
      *> 13.18.19.4 GR1 sets the minimum length to zero, so D-BARE is length 0 before the MOVE; GR2 makes
      *> integer-1 the maximum, and 3 <= 30 so the MOVE is exact. FUNCTION LENGTH of a dynamic-length item
      *> is its CURRENT length (15.50), hence LEN0=0 then LEN1=3.
