      *> kb/Work PB965 - A FIXED-LENGTH GROUP ARGUMENT INTO A VARIABLE-LENGTH GROUP FORMAL OF A METHOD.
      *>
      *> The INVOKE twin of pb965_fixed_group_vlg_boundary. 14.8.2.2: "If either the formal parameter or the
      *> argument is a variable length group, the formal parameter and the argument shall be compatible, as
      *> described in 8.5.1.12" - and 8.5.1.12.1 admits a fixed-length group on one side. ST starts at
      *> relative position 2 as L1 does, so they correspond (8.5.1.12.2) and ST crosses as a table of its
      *> fixed 3 occurrences (8.5.1.12.3). This used to stop the run with a not-implemented "Tier-C byte
      *> island" that blamed a dynamic member the FIXED argument does not have.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED:
      *>   M   - the formal sees capacity 3 and [CD][TTT][EF].
      *>   SG  - 14.2.3 GR8: the method's stores L0 := qq and L1(2) := u are visible in the argument.
