      *> kb/Work PB965 - A FIXED-LENGTH GROUP OPPOSITE A VARIABLE-LENGTH GROUP ACROSS A CALL BOUNDARY.
      *>
      *> 14.8.2.2: "If either the formal parameter or the argument is a variable length group, the formal
      *> parameter and the argument shall be compatible, as described in 8.5.1.12, Variable-length groups."
      *> 8.5.1.12.1 admits the pair ("only one of the operands may be a variable-length group"). 14.8.3.2 says
      *> the same of a RETURNING pair. 8.5.1.12.2: "Two tables correspond if at least one of them is a
      *> dynamic-capacity table and they occupy the same relative byte positions within their groups" - ST
      *> (and the alias's AQ, and the returning items' tables) start at relative position 2, as the dynamic
      *> table does. 8.5.1.12.3 treats the fixed table "as though it were a dynamic-capacity table whose
      *> capacity is either its fixed number of occurrences", so it crosses at capacity 3.
      *> This used to cross as an EMPTY carrier (capacity 0, every field blank) and the callee's stores were
      *> lost - a silent wrong answer; RETURNING a fixed group into a variable-length receiver aborted.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED:
      *>   N/X - the formal sees the argument's own content: capacity 3, [CD][TTT][EF].
      *>   C1  - 14.2.3 GR8 ("operates as if the formal parameter occupies the same storage area as the
      *>         argument"): L0 := qq and L1(2) := u land in SG, so SRC = AB qq TuT EF.
      *>   C2  - the same through a level-66 THROUGH alias (13.18.45.4 GR2 - a group item): ab qq tut ef.
      *>   C3  - a separately compiled callee (no AS NESTED), BY REFERENCE: rr and L1(3) := v land.
      *>   C4  - 14.2.3 GR9, BY CONTENT: a copy - the callee's stores reach nothing, SRC is unchanged.
      *>   R1  - 14.6.5 / 14.8.3.2: the fixed returning item's content mnopqrs lands in VG, its table
      *>         at capacity 3 (8.5.1.12.3).
      *>   R2  - the reverse: a capacity-2 dynamic table into a 3-occurrence fixed table; 14.6.9.2's rule
      *>         for a non-dynamic receiving table space-fills the remaining element: tu vw_ yz.
      *>   M1/M2 - 14.9.25.4 GR9 between LEAD and VG: LA (at position 0) is opposite V1's plain bytes and so
      *>         corresponds to NOTHING; only LB (at position 2) corresponds to VT. VT takes bbb, V1 takes aa,
      *>         and the move back returns zz bbb cc.
