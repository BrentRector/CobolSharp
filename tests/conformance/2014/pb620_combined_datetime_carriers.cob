      *> kb/Work PB620 — ISO §15.17 COMBINED-DATETIME under NATIVE arithmetic: the twin of
      *> conformance:2014/pb620_combined_datetime_eae, and the only place the THIRD carrier is reachable.
      *>
      *> WHY A SECOND PROGRAM. §15.17.3 r2 is a rule about argument-2's VALUE — "Argument-2 shall be in standard
      *> numeric time form", which §15.5.5 defines by magnitude alone — so the USAGE of the item holding that
      *> value cannot decide whether §15.3's "incorrect value for that argument" applies. COMBINED-DATETIME has
      *> three carriers: the exact fixed-point lane, the SDIDI (which claims every floating-point argument under
      *> ARITHMETIC IS STANDARD-DECIMAL, so the binary64 body is unreachable there), and binary64 under NATIVE.
      *> The binary64 body had NO argument rule at all: measured before the fix, F3 below computed
      *> 1.8639999999999 and set no exception condition, while the identical value in a fixed-point item
      *> terminated the run unit in the same program under the same armed directive.
      *>
      *> ⚠ NO BINARY64 VALUE IS PRINTED. §15.4.1's last paragraph gives a function with an equivalent arithmetic
      *> expression "an implementor-defined approximation of the value of that expression" when native arithmetic
      *> is in effect, and 1/100000 is not a binary fraction, so the float legs assert the RULE-derived facts —
      *> that a legal argument is admitted and lands strictly between 1 and 2, and that an illegal one raises —
      *> never a digit string. The fixed-point legs are exact and carry the values, derived as in the twin:
      *> 3661.12345678 / 100000 = 0.0366112345678, + 1 = 1.0366112345678.
      *>
      *> ARMED, NOT ASSUMED: G3 raises from the binary64 carrier and the declarative reports it; the abandoned
      *> COMPUTE leaves the receiver at its preset 9. G4 is the complement — the same carrier, a legal value, no
      *> raise — because a guard that fired early would be exactly as wrong as one that never fired.
