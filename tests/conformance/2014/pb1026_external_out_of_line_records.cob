      *> kb/Work PB1026 - an EXTERNAL file whose record area holds OUT-OF-LINE records (determination
      *> D-FRA): a dynamic-length record, a variable-length group record and a pointer-class record.
      *> ISO 13.18.22.4 GR4 b): "the data contained in all record description entries subordinate to that
      *> file description entry is external and may be accessed by any runtime element in the run unit
      *> that describes the same file and records as external" - so ALL of the area is one copy per run
      *> unit, not only its character half. Three separately compiled programs describe the file under
      *> DIFFERENT record names (GR5 externalizes the FILE name), and each sees the others' values.
      *> The WORKING-STORAGE twin (ISO 13.18.22.4 GR1): an EXTERNAL group with a dynamic-length member,
      *> whose member used to be a zero-width window of the shared cell (DISPLAY showed "   ").
      *> Expected values:
      *>   B1: B sees A's stores - WG = "ABC"+"HELLO" (ISO 8.5.1.11.2, contiguous), BR2 = "DYNREC",
      *>       BR3 = "007"+"XY"+"ZZ"; B2: the pointer record A set is not NULL in B.
      *>   A1: A sees B's stores - WG2 "WORLD!", AR2 "B-SIDE", AR3B "LONGER"; A2: B set it to NULL.
      *>   A3: FUNCTION LENGTH(WG) = 3 + 6 = 9 (ISO 15.50.4 - the current length of the dynamic item).
      *>   A4: XC READs the record "0123456789" through its own descriptions; in A, AR1 and AR2 hold it
      *>       whole, and AR3 (fixed run 5) splits it by the D-FRA take step: AR3A "012", AR3B "34567"
      *>       (the 5 characters beyond the fixed run), AR3C "89".
      *>   A5: an ADDRESS-OF-taken variable-length group (the same cell-backed storage shape) keeps its
      *>       dynamic member's VALUE and its fixed members: "PQR"+"ab"+"42", LENGTH 7.
