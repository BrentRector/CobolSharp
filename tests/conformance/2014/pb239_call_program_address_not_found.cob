      *> kb/Work PB239 - a PROGRAM-ADDRESS-IDENTIFIER argument that cannot
      *> be located, with EC-PROGRAM-NOT-FOUND checking ENABLED. 8.4.3.13.4
      *> GR4: "the EC-PROGRAM-NOT-FOUND exception condition is set to exist".
      *> 14.9.4.4 GR3a: identifier-2 is "evaluated ... at the beginning of
      *> the execution of the CALL statement. If an exception condition
      *> exists, no program is called and execution proceeds as specified
      *> in General rule 3h" - and GR3h item 1 runs ON EXCEPTION for an
      *> EC-PROGRAM condition. So PB239PQ is never activated (no "CALLED"
      *> line) and the phrase runs: EXC. The located spelling of the same
      *> statement calls normally and takes NOT ON EXCEPTION (GR3i).
