      *> kb/Work PB829 (finisher) - the SPECIAL-NAMES dynamic-length-structure-clause, ISO 12.3.7.2:
      *>   DYNAMIC LENGTH [STRUCTURE] dynamic-length-structure-name-1 [IS]
      *>       { |[SIGNED] [SHORT] PREFIXED| |DELIMITED| } | physical-structure-name-1
      *> (STRUCTURE and IS un-underlined; PREFIXED/DELIMITED in choice indicators - one or more, any
      *> order).  It had no grammar at all: `DYNAMIC LENGTH STRUCTURE DLS1 IS PREFIXED.` was COBOL0001,
      *> and a DYNAMIC LENGTH clause naming a structure was refused as "not yet supported".
      *> What the declaration decides is OBSERVABLE: ISO 8.5.1.10.1 makes an item's maximum size "the
      *> smallest of" its LIMIT phrase, "the largest integer that can be stored in an item of the usage
      *> specified in the PREFIXED phrase", and the implementor maximum; 12.3.7.4 GR18 sizes the length
      *> field (SHORT PREFIXED 65535, SIGNED SHORT PREFIXED 32767, PREFIXED / SIGNED PREFIXED past any
      *> 70000).  A 70000-character sender therefore stores 65535, 32767, all 70000 (DELIMITED has no
      *> length field) and 70000 (PREFIXED + DELIMITED, 32-bit field) characters, and a LIMIT phrase
      *> below the field's capacity still wins (10).  The contained program references a name its
      *> container declares (ISO 8.4.6.1 - configuration-section names reach contained elements).
