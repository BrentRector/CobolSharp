      *> floating-point operand consistently with ISO/IEC 60559:
      *>   1  two receivers of ONE statement both hold +infinity, and +infinity equals +infinity.
      *>   2  GR33's sign: -infinity is less than +infinity, so SIGN NEGATIVE reached the sign bit.
      *>   3  GR34: a quiet NaN is unequal to ITSELF - the defining observable property of a NaN, and proof the
      *>      receiver did not merely take some finite value.
      *>   4  GR35: a signaling NaN is likewise unequal to itself.
      *>   5  a NaN is not an infinity: the binary32 NaN and the binary32 +infinity are unequal.
      *> The QUIET-versus-SIGNALING distinction has no COBOL surface here - the class condition that would expose
      *> it (8.8.4.4's FLOAT-NOT-A-NUMBER-QUIET / -SIGNALING, kb/Work PB225) is not implemented - so it is pinned
      *> bit-for-bit by unit:IeeeSpecialsTests instead, against the same table this emitter writes.
