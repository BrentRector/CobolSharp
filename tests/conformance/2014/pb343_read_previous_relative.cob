      *> kb/Work PB343 — READ ... PREVIOUS on a file with RELATIVE organization, the 2014 leg.
      *> Until PB343 the connector applied the INDEXED block's after-OPEN carve-out here: a READ
      *> PREVIOUS immediately after OPEN INPUT returned the at end condition where the relative
      *> block's own rule b) owes the first existing record.
      *>
      *> THE RULES, and every expected value below derived from them (no observation):
      *>  14.9.27.4 GR14 - "When the organization of the file referenced by file-name-1 is
      *>    sequential or relative and the INPUT or I-O phrase is specified in the OPEN statement,
      *>    the file position indicator for that file connector is set to 1."
      *>  14.9.30.4 GR21 "When the file is a relative file":
      *>    b) indicator established by a prior successful OPEN or START -> "the first existing
      *>       record that is selected is made available, REGARDLESS of whether NEXT or PREVIOUS is
      *>       specified"                                          (R1, S1/S2, T1, T2)
      *>    c) established by a prior successful READ -> the first existing record whose relative
      *>       key number is "greater than the file position indicator if NEXT ... or is less than
      *>       the file position indicator if PREVIOUS"             (R2, R4, R5, R6)
      *>    e) no record found -> the at end condition               (R2, E1)
      *>    f) the indicator becomes the RRN of the record made available (R6 proves it: the
      *>       forward read after two backward ones resumes from the REPOSITIONED indicator)
      *>  14.9.30.4 GR24 a)/c) - the at end condition sets '10' and transfers control to the AT END
      *>    imperative                                              (R2, E1)
      *>  14.9.30.4 GR25 - a successful sequential READ MOVEs the RRN of the record made available
      *>    into the RELATIVE KEY item, which is what the middle field of each line shows
      *>  14.9.41.4 GR9 a)/b) - START sets the indicator to "the relative record number of the first
      *>    logical record in the file whose key satisfies the comparison", searching forward for
      *>    EQUAL/GREATER/NOT LESS/GREATER OR EQUAL and IN REVERSE ORDER for LESS/NOT GREATER/LESS
      *>    OR EQUAL; c) makes an unsatisfied comparison the invalid key condition.  So a relative
      *>    file's indicator, when a START established it, always names an EXISTING record  (T1, T2)
      *>
      *> WHY THE SPARSE FILE IS HERE.  On a DENSE file rule b) cannot be told apart from a backward
      *> walk that merely includes the indicator: both answer RRN 1.  The sparse file has its lowest
      *> record at RRN 5, so OPEN's indicator of 1 names an EMPTY slot and only a direction-BLIND
      *> rule b) can make S1 (PREVIOUS) and S2 (NEXT) name the same record.
      *>
      *> EDITIONS: identical at 2002, 2014 and 2023 -- which is what the three copies of this program
      *> assert.  Annex E is INFORMATIVE (its heading is "(informative)") and its only READ-
      *> positioning change, E.2 item 22, amends the INDEXED sub-rule d.3 -- "If no such record is
      *> found or PREVIOUS is specified and the previous operation on the file was an OPEN statement,
      *> the at end condition exists" -- which is written in the indexed block alone.  The relative
      *> block prints rule b) unamended, so this organization's selection takes no edition parameter.
      *> At --std 85 the whole program is rejected: negative/pb343-read-previous-relative-85.
