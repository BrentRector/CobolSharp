      *> kb/Work PB647 — ONE returned value, ONE rounding decision, taken at the RESULTANT IDENTIFIER.
      *> PB623 made the arithmetic channel and the MOVE channel compute the same exact binary64 expansion;
      *> what still split them was the MODE. The float-intrinsic quantizer rounded NEAREST-AWAY-FROM-ZERO at
      *> a working scale no matter what the statement said, so `MOVE FUNCTION SQRT(3) TO R9` gave
      *> 1.732050807 and `COMPUTE R9 = FUNCTION SQRT(3)` gave 1.732050808 into ONE PIC 9V9(9), and the
      *> ROUNDED phrase was a NO-OP on the whole family.
      *>
      *> THE RULES. ISO 15.4.1: "the returned value is the same for all instances of a given function within
      *> a single execution of the runtime element so long as the value and order of the arguments, the
      *> collating sequence, and the locale are unchanged" -- so the two channels may not disagree.
      *> 14.6.8.2 rule 4 gives the MOVE its landing: "If the receiving operand is a fixed-point numeric item,
      *> the data is aligned by decimal point and is transferred to the receiving digits with zero fill or
      *> truncation on either end as required."  14.7.4.1 gives the arithmetic store the SAME shape: "If,
      *> after decimal point alignment, the number of places in the fractional part of the result of an
      *> arithmetic operation is greater than the number of places provided for the fraction of the resultant
      *> identifier, truncation is relative to the size provided for the resultant identifier."  14.7.4.3
      *> rule 2: "If the ROUNDED phrase is not specified, execution is as if ROUNDED MODE IS TRUNCATION had
      *> been specified", and rule 10 spells TRUNCATION out as "the nearest value nearer to zero".  8.8.1.3's
      *> native latitude ("Native arithmetic is an implementor-defined method of evaluating an arithmetic
      *> expression, an arithmetic statement, the SUM clause, and all integer and numeric functions") covers
      *> the INTERMEDIATE, never the rounding of the transfer that 14.7.4.1/14.7.4.3 fix.
      *>
      *> EVERY EXPECTED VALUE IS THE EXACT DECIMAL EXPANSION OF THE BINARY64, COMPUTED, NEVER OBSERVED:
