      *> kb/Work R43 / PB579 — the OPTIONS paragraph's FLOAT-DECIMAL
      *> clause (§11.9.9) is DECLINED. Annex A.3 item 13: "The
      *> FLOAT-DECIMAL clause is dependent both on the capabilities of
      *> the processor and on support for the standard decimal
      *> floating-point usages", and FLOAT-DECIMAL-16 / FLOAT-DECIMAL-34
      *> are not provided (A.3 item 19, refused COBOLNET1564). §4.2.6
      *> makes the compile-time warning mandatory for a declined
      *> processor-dependent element: "An implementation shall provide a
      *> warning mechanism at compile time to indicate use of
      *> syntactically-detectable processor-dependent language elements
      *> not supported by that implementation." That warning is
      *> COBOLNET2424, pinned by conformance-test
      *> DocumentedNonSupportWitnessTests; until kb/Work R43 the clause
      *> compiled with no diagnostic at all.
      *> THE OUTPUT IS THE INERT HALF. Every rule the clause states
      *> (§11.9.9.3 SR1-SR6) implies a phrase for "any data item
      *> described with a standard decimal floating-point usage", and no
      *> such item can be declared, so the program's other items are
      *> untouched: the FLOAT-BINARY-32 item below keeps its own
      *> behaviour and the numeric item computes as without the clause.
