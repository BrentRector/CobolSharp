      *> kb/Work PB391 (second half). ISO 1989:2023 14.7.6 rule 2 sends the CORRESPONDING pairing decision to
      *> the WHOLE of the MOVE statement's validity. 14.9.25.3 SR10, the rule that routes to table 16, governs
      *> only "all other cases not described in Syntax rules 8 and 9", so SR9 is asked before the table:
      *>
      *>   SR9 - "If identifier-1 or identifier-2 references a variable-length group then these groups shall be
      *>          compatible groups as specified in 8.5.1.12, Variable-length groups."
      *>
      *> 8.5.1.12.1 states the prohibition in terms of the OTHER operand - a variable-length group "may not
      *> undergo a comparison or a move operation, in either direction, explicitly or otherwise, unless the
      *> other operand is a compatible group" - so an ELEMENTARY namesake opposite a variable-length group is a
      *> violation, not a fall-through, in both directions.
      *>
      *> COBOL-2014 is SR9's introducing edition: a variable-length group needs a DYNAMIC LENGTH elementary
      *> item (13.18.19) or an OCCURS DYNAMIC table (13.18.38 format 4), both 2014 additions.
      *>
      *> VA (variable-length group -> elementary) and VB (elementary -> variable-length group) are the two
      *> directions 8.5.1.12.1 names, and they are the ONLY shapes in which SR9 can reach rule 2's filter at
      *> all: a group x group namesake pair DESCENDS instead (14.9.25.4 GR11 NOTE 5), so one side of any pair
      *> the filter sees is elementary and an engaged SR9 is therefore always a violation. Neither pair
      *> corresponds, so both receivers keep their prior content - a refused pair is a SILENT non-selection
      *> under rule 2, never a diagnostic. VC is the CONTROL for the descent: two compatible variable-length
      *> groups of the same name, whose elementary members DO pair and move, proving the fix refuses the pair
      *> SR9 names and not every namesake under a variable-length group. MM proves the statement ran.
      *>
      *> Before PB391 the filter asked only table 16, which has no row for a variable-length group and exempts
      *> every GROUP operand under 14.9.25.4 GR4: VA and VB both paired, and the emitted implied MOVE asked for
      *> a whole-group character image the pair can never have, so the program reached the RUN TIME and threw
      *> NotImplementedCobolFeatureException - while the SAME compiler refused the written MOVE of those two
      *> items with COBOLNET1931.
