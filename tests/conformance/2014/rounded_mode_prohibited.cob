      *> ISO §14.7.4 — ROUNDED MODE IS PROHIBITED (COBOL-2002). Rounding is NOT permitted, so a result that
      *> is not exactly representable at the receiver's scale raises the SIZE ERROR condition
      *> (EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION) and leaves the receiver UNCHANGED — it must NOT silently truncate.
      *> Regression test for the bug where PROHIBITED fell through to truncation and never signaled size error:
      *>   2.25 into PIC 9.9 (one fraction digit) is inexact -> SIZE ERROR, X stays 7.7.
      *>   2.20 into PIC 9.9 is exact                        -> no size error, X becomes 2.2.
