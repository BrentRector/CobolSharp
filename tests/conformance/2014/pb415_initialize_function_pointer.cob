      *> kb/Work PB415 — the COBOL-2014 INITIALIZE category-name FUNCTION-POINTER (ISO §14.9.20.2), at its own
      *> introduction edition. §8.9 reserves FUNCTION-POINTER from 2014, which is the same edition that
      *> introduced the USAGE FUNCTION-POINTER category (§13.18.60); below 2014 the word is refused
      *> COBOLNET0900 by the initialize-category-2014 construct row.
      *>
      *> ⛔ FUNCTION-POINTER IS THE ASYMMETRIC ONE, AND THE ASYMMETRY IS THE PRINTED STANDARD (PB418 verified it
      *> against the licensed PDF at folio 639): §14.9.20.4 GR4's SET-form list, GR6a1's sender list and GR6c's
      *> fill table all name function-pointer, and GR5c1a alone does NOT. With §13.18.63.3 SR9 forbidding a VALUE
      *> clause on a FUNCTION-POINTER item, GR5c1b and GR5c1c are false too — so a function-pointer is NOT a
      *> receiving-operand under the VALUE phrase, and IS one under REPLACING (GR5c2), DEFAULT (GR5c3) and the
      *> bare form (GR5c4).
      *>
      *> EXPECTED, DERIVED FROM THE RULES ABOVE AND WRITTEN DOWN BEFORE THE RUN:
      *>   1[SET]   REPLACING FUNCTION-POINTER … BY FP1 qualifies FP2 through GR5c2 and GR6b gives it FP1 —
      *>            the implicit `SET FP2 TO FP1` of GR4. Before PB415 the category-name did not parse.
      *>   1B[SAME] the receiver holds exactly identifier-2's value.
      *>   2[SET]   ⛔ ALL TO VALUE leaves it ALONE — GR5c1a omits function-pointer, so the item is not a
      *>            receiving-operand under the VALUE phrase and keeps line 1's value. This is the one line that
      *>            would flip if the GR5c1a list were "evened up" with GR6a1's.
      *>   3[NULL]  the BARE form (GR5c4) does reach it, and GR6c's fill table gives the predefined address NULL.
