      *> kb/Work PB189 - A SUBSCRIPTED ELEMENT OF A DYNAMIC-CAPACITY
      *> TABLE IS AN ORDINARY FIXED-LENGTH GROUP OPERAND.
      *> 8.5.1.12.1: "A variable-length group is a group item whose
      *> data description has at least one dynamic-length elementary
      *> item or dynamic-capacity table as a subordinate item. All
      *> other group items are referred to as fixed-length groups" -
      *> THE DYNAMIC AXIS BELONGS TO THE TABLE; ONE OCCURRENCE OF GT
      *> HAS NO SUCH SUBORDINATE. 14.9.11.4 GR4 TRANSFERS "THE DATA
      *> ITEM BEING TRANSFERRED" - THE ELEMENT - AND 14.9.11.3 SR1
      *> EXCLUDES ONLY CLASS MESSAGE-TAG, OBJECT OR POINTER. SO
      *> DISPLAY GT(n) SHOWS THE ELEMENT'S IMAGE: ZONED GT-N THEN GT-A.
      *> THE ELEMENT IS OBSERVED AT TWO CAPACITIES ALONGSIDE THE
      *> WHOLE-GROUP DISPLAY (A.1 ITEM 57 FORMAT, EVERY OCCURRENCE AT
      *> CURRENT CAPACITY) SO THE TWO ARE SEEN TO AGREE; OCCURRENCE 2,
      *> GROWN BUT UNTOUCHED, SHOWS THE DOCUMENTED SEED "00 ".
      *> THE SAME OPERAND AS A MOVE SENDER/RECEIVER (14.9.25.4 GR4 -
      *> A GROUP MOVE), REFERENCE-MODIFIED, AND AS A CALL ARGUMENT.
      *> BEFORE THE FIX EVERY ONE OF THESE WAS A RUN-TIME TIER-C LOUD.
