      *> kb/Work PB981 - determination D-FRA (docs/CONFORMANCE.md section 3): an FD/SD record that is a
      *> dynamic-length item or a variable-length group is an OUT-OF-LINE record. ISO 13.18.33.4 GR3 makes
      *> the FD's level-1 entries implicit redefinitions of one area; ISO 8.5.1.10.3 lets a dynamic-length
      *> item be "located elsewhere", so it shares the area at the transfer boundary: a READ makes the
      *> CURRENT RECORD available in it, and a WRITE sends its contiguous image (ISO 8.5.1.11.2).
      *> The file implies a format 2 RECORD clause (ISO 13.18.43.4 GR5 - implementor-defined).
      *> Record R = A X(3) + D dynamic (LIMIT 20) + B X(2): the fixed run is 5 characters; a record read
      *> back gives D every character beyond the fixed run, up to its maximum (the D-FRA split rule).
      *>   record 1 "ABCHELLOXY"    : A=ABC D=HELLO(5) B=XY ; R2 (the character area) = ABCH ; R3 = all 10
      *>   record 2 "SHOR"          : shorter than the fixed run - A=SHO D=""(0) B="R " ; R3 = SHOR (4)
      *>   record 3 "A LONGER LINE" : 13 - 5 = 8 characters to D - A="A L" D="ONGER LI"(8) B=NE ; R3 13
      *> This used to be refused (COBOLNET1697/1698, then COBOLNET0899), and a single-record FD with a
      *> dynamic-length member aborted the run unit at WRITE.
