      *> kb/Work PB1025 - a SORT key and an indexed RECORD KEY / ALTERNATE
      *> RECORD KEY that FOLLOW a dynamic-length item. The record is held
      *> as its contiguous image (ISO 8.5.1.11.2), so each key's byte
      *> positions move with the current length of NM; 14.9.40.3 SR6 g)
      *> and 12.4.5.12.3 SR4 / 12.4.5.6.3 SR5 admit the key because the
      *> trailing FILLER keeps its furthest reach (NM at its LIMIT 10 plus
      *> the key) within the minimum record size (13.18.43.4 GR9: NM at
      *> zero length, so 22 / 23 bytes). The NM lengths are chosen so a
      *> key sliced at its FIXED-run offset would read NM's characters
      *> and order the records 30 / 20 / 10 - the expected order below
      *> is the key's own (14.9.40.4 GR8; 14.9.30.4 GR32; 14.9.41.4).
