       *>  1. CALL "PB34CBX" reaches PROGRAM-ID PB34CB - ISO 14.9.4.4 GR3 b)
       *>     makes literal-1 "the program-name of the program being called, as
       *>     described in 8.3.2.2", and 8.3.2.2 makes the AS literal that name.  The
       *>     DECLARED word PB34CB is NOT what CALL matches.
       *>  2. END PROGRAM PB34CB names the DECLARED word - ISO 10.7.3 SR2:
       *>     "Program-name-1 shall be identical to the program-name declared in a
       *>     preceding PROGRAM-ID paragraph."  The two names therefore stay distinct;
       *>     a compiler that folded literal-1 onto the program-name could not compile
       *>     this program at all.
       *>  3. FUNCTION PB34FN activates FUNCTION-ID PB34FN AS "PB34FNX" - a
       *>     user-function-name is referenced as a WORD (ISO 8.4.6.6 / 8.4.6.7), so
       *>     the AS literal does not intercept it, while 11.5.4 GR1 still externalizes
       *>     the function under "PB34FNX".
