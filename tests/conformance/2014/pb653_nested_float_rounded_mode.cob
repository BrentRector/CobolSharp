      *> kb/Work PB653 at COBOL-2014 -- THE EIGHT-MODE ROUNDED PHRASE REACHES AN EXPRESSION WITH A NESTED
      *> FLOAT OPERAND, AND IS APPLIED ONCE, AT THE RESULTANT IDENTIFIER. The whole substance of PB653 is the
      *> 85 golden (tests/conformance/85/pb653_nested_float_operand); THIS edition adds the one thing 85 and
      *> 2002 cannot express -- the ROUNDED MODE IS phrase, a COBOL-2014 introduction (COBOLNET0803 below it;
      *> the negative is tests/conformance/negative/pb653-nested-float-rounded-mode-below-2014).
      *>
      *> It is a real behaviour difference and not a syntax copy. While a NESTED float operand was quantized
      *> at the >=9 working scale with truncation, the operand reached the store ALREADY truncated at 9, the
      *> store's own rescale was the identity, and EVERY mode therefore answered 1.732050807 -- the phrase was
      *> a no-op on this shape. Keeping the binary64 restores the discarded fraction to the ONE place entitled
      *> to round it: 14.7.4.3 rules 3-10 each speak of "the resultant identifier", and 14.7.4.1 puts the
      *> truncation there -- "If, after decimal point alignment, the number of places in the fractional part of
      *> the result of an arithmetic operation is greater than the number of places provided for the fraction
      *> of the resultant identifier, truncation is relative to the size provided for the resultant
      *> identifier". 14.7.4.3 rule 2 gives the no-phrase store its mode: "If the ROUNDED phrase is not
      *> specified, execution is as if ROUNDED MODE IS TRUNCATION had been specified".
      *>
      *> EVERY EXPECTED VALUE IS COMPUTED FROM THE EXACT DECIMAL EXPANSION OF THE BINARY64:
      *>   sqrt(3)      = 1.732050807568877193176604123436845839023590087890625
      *>       at 9 fraction digits the discarded tail is .568877193... -- ABOVE half, so every NEAREST mode
      *>       goes up, TOWARD-GREATER and AWAY-FROM-ZERO go up, TRUNCATION and TOWARD-LESSER go down.
      *>   sqrt(0.0625) = 0.25 EXACTLY (0.0625 is 2**-4, its root 2**-2) -- so at ONE fraction digit the
      *>       discarded tail is exactly half, which is the only way to tell the four NEAREST modes apart:
      *>       NEAREST-EVEN keeps 0.2 (2 is even), NEAREST-TOWARD-ZERO keeps 0.2, NEAREST-AWAY-FROM-ZERO
      *>       gives 0.3; and at NINE fraction digits 0.25 is EXACT, which is what PROHIBITED needs.
      *>   14.7.4.3 rule 7: "If the PROHIBITED phrase is specified, and the arithmetic value cannot be
      *>       represented exactly in the resultant identifier, the EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION exception condition is
      *>       set to exist, the size error condition exists" -- and the receiver is left unchanged.
