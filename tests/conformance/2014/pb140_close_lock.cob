      *> kb/Work PB140 - ISO 14.9.6.4 GR1: a CLOSE of a not-open file is
      *> UNSUCCESSFUL ('42'), and an unsuccessful CLOSE WITH LOCK performs
      *> none of its closing actions - the later OPEN succeeds ('00',
      *> never the poisoned '38'). A SUCCESSFUL CLOSE WITH LOCK does lock:
      *> the reopen is '38'. (CLOSE ... WITH LOCK is legal through 2014.)
