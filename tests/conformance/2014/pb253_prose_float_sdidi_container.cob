      *> kb/Work PB253 — under ARITHMETIC IS STANDARD-DECIMAL the PROSE float family's returned value is
      *> CONTAINED IN an SDIDI in EVERY reference context, not only when a fixed-point arithmetic receiver
      *> happens to be present. ISO 15.4.1: "When standard-decimal arithmetic or standard-binary arithmetic is
      *> in effect, the returned value for numeric and integer functions is contained in a temporary standard
      *> data item in the intermediate form defined for the arithmetic mode in effect" — unconditional on the
      *> shape of whatever consumes the value; and 8.8.1.5.1 makes the mode "a method of evaluating an
      *> arithmetic expression, an arithmetic statement, the SUM clause, and certain integer and numeric
      *> functions as specified in 15.4.1". 15.4.1's last paragraph ("When a numeric or integer function does
      *> not have an equivalent arithmetic expression, its returned value is implementor-defined") exempts the
      *> VALUE — the binary64 approximation this family computes — never the CONTAINER.
      *> The family with no equivalent arithmetic expression and no SDIDI body is ACOS/ASIN/ATAN/COS/SIN/TAN/
      *> LOG/LOG10/RANDOM; the defect made the SDIDI arm unreachable for every receiver-less or float-receiver
      *> reference, so the raw binary64 escaped into the text, MOVE-source, float-receiver and relation channels.
      *>
      *> HAND-DERIVED EXPECTATIONS.
      *> TINY is the exact scale-20 value 1E-20; ScaledToDouble gives the binary64 nearest 1E-20. For that
      *> argument x, sin x = x - x**3/6, tan x = x + x**3/3 and atan x = x - x**3/3, and |x**3/3| ~ 3.3E-61 is
      *> some 25 decades below the ULP of x (~1.6E-36), so each rounds to x itself in binary64. The 8.8.1.5.1
      *> float -> SDIDI conversion is the shortest round-trip decimal identity, so the SDIDI is exactly 1E-20
      *> and its 15.4.1 item-92 text is the fixed-point digit string 0.00000000000000000001 — NEVER the
      *> binary64 E-notation "1E-20" the un-contained value printed.
      *> COS(0) = 1 exactly, and ACOS(1) / ASIN(0) / LOG(1) / LOG10(1) are 0 exactly (each an exact
      *> binary64 result), so their SDIDI texts are "1" and "0".
      *> Storing the SDIDI 1E-20 into PIC SV9(20) is exact: unscaled 1, DISPLAY image 19 zeros then the
      *> overpunched +1 ("A").
      *> The large-magnitude legs pin the 15.4.1 INVARIANT rather than an implementor-defined digit string:
      *> "the returned value is the same for all instances of a given function within a single execution of the
      *> runtime element so long as the value and order of the arguments, the collating sequence, and the locale
      *> are unchanged". Before the fix `MOVE FUNCTION TAN(NEARHALF)` landed 16331239353195368.96 (the
      *> binary64 x 10**scale artifact) while `COMPUTE ... = FUNCTION TAN(NEARHALF)` landed 16331239353195370.00
      *> — two returned values for one function and one argument in one run.
      *> RANDOM's seeded form restarts the sequence (15.75.3), so two seeded references share an argument and
      *> owe the same returned value in both channels.
