      *> table (OCCURS DYNAMIC, §8.5.1.9 — COBOL-2014) whose IMPLICIT growth (a receiving
      *> subscript) first crosses its expected capacity (TO integer-5) sets the nonfatal
      *> EC-BOUND-OVERFLOW under CHECKING ON. GR1's "if the change in capacity was implicit
      *> and the expected capacity had already been exceeded before the operation, no
      *> exception shall exist" makes it the FIRST crossing only. Observed via
      *> FUNCTION EXCEPTION-STATUS (§15.33); SET LAST EXCEPTION TO OFF clears it (§14.9.39
      *> Format 13). The growth proceeds regardless (nonfatal), so with checking OFF the
      *> observable result is identical.
