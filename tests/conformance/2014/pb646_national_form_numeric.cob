      *> kb/Work PB646 - the NATIONAL-FORM data of ISO 1989:2023 13.18.60.3 SR12: a numeric, a
      *> numeric-edited and a boolean PICTURE under USAGE NATIONAL.
      *>
      *> 13.18.60.3 SR12: "An elementary data item with usage national shall be described with a
      *> picture character-string that describes a boolean, national, national-edited, numeric, or
      *> numeric-edited data item." FIVE shapes; the first two of them (national, national-edited) were
      *> already live and the other three were refused BY NAME at COBOLNET0899 until this landing.
      *>
      *> WHAT USAGE NATIONAL CHANGES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
      *>   13.18.40.4 GR1: "When the usage of the subject of the entry is national, each symbol
      *>     representing a character position defines a national character position." So the item's
      *>     digits, its separate sign and its insertion characters are NATIONAL character positions -
      *>     the same characters its DISPLAY twin holds, in a different character set.
      *>   13.18.60.4 GR8: "National characters shall be represented in the storage of the computer as
      *>     characters of a uniform size equal to or a multiple of the size of characters in the
      *>     computer's alphanumeric character set." The implementor pins that size; COBOL.NET pins TWO
      *>     bytes, UTF-16BE (data-model design D-N1), so an n-position item occupies 2n bytes.
      *> Nothing else moves: the VALUE is the same number, the arithmetic is the same arithmetic, and
      *> the character image is the same digit run (design D-N7).
      *>
      *> EVERY expected line below is computed from the standard, not read off a run:
      *>
      *> NNUM  PIC 9(3) USAGE NATIONAL VALUE 123 -> three '9' digit positions (GR14: "Each symbol '9'
      *>       represents a digit position that contains a numeral and is counted in the size of the
      *>       item"), so [123]; after ADD 1, [124]. FUNCTION LENGTH is 15.50.4 r2 - "an elementary
      *>       data item of usage national other than a boolean data item ... the length of argument-1
      *>       in national character positions" - so 3; FUNCTION BYTE-LENGTH is GR8's size, 2 x 3 = 6.
      *>
      *> NSGN  PIC S9(3) USAGE NATIONAL SIGN IS LEADING SEPARATE VALUE -45. 13.18.52.3 SR2 admits the
      *>       SIGN clause here by name ("The usage of an elementary item for which the SIGN clause is
      *>       specified shall be display or national") and GR6a makes the separate sign "the leading
      *>       (or, respectively, trailing) character position of the data item to which it applies;
      *>       this character position is not a digit position", with GR6b's operational signs '+' and
      *>       '-'. So the item is FOUR national character positions - [-045] - LENGTH 4 and
      *>       BYTE-LENGTH 8. (Its DISPLAY twin answers 4 for LENGTH too; the two spellings differ only
      *>       in GR8's per-character size.)
      *>
      *> GSE / SAMES  13.18.49.4 GR5: "If an alphanumeric group item, national group item, or
      *>       strongly-typed group item to which data-name-1 is subordinate contains a SIGN clause,
      *>       the effect is as though that SIGN clause had been specified for the subject of the
      *>       entry." GR3 says the same for a USAGE clause and GR1 copies the rest of the
      *>       description ("the effect ... is as though the data description identified by
      *>       data-name-1 had been coded in place of the SAME AS clause, excluding the level-number,
      *>       name, and the CONSTANT RECORD, EXTERNAL, GLOBAL, REDEFINES, and SELECT WHEN clauses" -
      *>       the VALUE clause is not in that list, so it comes too). SAMES therefore IS GSE's
      *>       description: usage national, PIC S9(3), SIGN IS LEADING SEPARATE, VALUE -45 - and by
      *>       13.18.52.4 GR6a over 13.18.40.4 GR1 that is FOUR national character positions,
      *>       [-045], LENGTH 4, BYTE-LENGTH 8 - the same three answers GSE itself gives. The two
      *>       routes by which an item acquires an ancestor's SIGN clause must agree; while they did
      *>       not, this shape measured 3 / 6 / [04N] (the over-punch image of a DISPLAY item).
      *>
      *> NED   PIC ZZ9 USAGE NATIONAL VALUE N"  7". 8.5.2.1 Table 2 puts "Numeric-edited (if usage is
      *>       national)" in class NATIONAL, so 13.18.63.3 SR7 - "If the item is of category
      *>       numeric-edited and the literal is of class alphanumeric or national, the class of the
      *>       literal shall conform to that of the data item" - requires a NATIONAL literal here, and
      *>       SR11 does not edit it ("Editing characters ... are used in editing of the initial value
      *>       when the data item is initialized and the literal is numeric"), so it stores verbatim:
      *>       [  7]. After MOVE 42, GR14's Z ("represents a ... digit position ... leading zeroes are
      *>       replaced by the space character") suppresses the one leading zero of 042: [ 42].
      *>       MOVE NED TO D3 then DE-EDITS (14.9.25.4 GR5 - "De-editing takes place only when the
      *>       sending operand is a numeric-edited data item and the receiving item is a numeric or a
      *>       numeric-edited data item"): [042].
      *>
      *> NBOOL PIC 1(4) USAGE NATIONAL VALUE B"1010". 13.18.40.4 GR8 ("To define an item as boolean,
      *>       character-string-1 shall contain only one or more occurrences of the symbol '1'") makes
      *>       it category boolean, SR12 admits the usage, and 13.18.63.3 SR10 takes the boolean
      *>       literal: [1010]. FUNCTION LENGTH is 15.50.4 r1, "the length of argument-1 in boolean
      *>       positions" - 4 - while BYTE-LENGTH is GR8's size over those 4 national positions, 8.
      *>
      *> NBZ / NBZN  13.18.8.3 SR2 admits BLANK WHEN ZERO on a usage-NATIONAL item by name ("The
      *>       subject of the entry shall be implicitly or explicitly described as usage display or
      *>       usage national"). 13.18.63.3 SR8: "When a numeric-edited data description includes the
      *>       BLANK WHEN ZERO clause and the VALUE clause uses either an alphanumeric or national
      *>       literal, the BLANK WHEN ZERO clause has no effect on initialization" - so NBZ, seeded
      *>       from N"  0", keeps [  0]; NBZN, seeded from the NUMERIC literal 0, is blanked by SR8's
      *>       NOTE 2 and 13.18.8.4 GR1: [   ]. After MOVE 0 the clause applies to both: [   ] / [   ].
      *>
      *> GL    13.18.60.4 GR1 - "If the USAGE clause is specified or implied at a group level, it
      *>       applies only to each elementary item in the group" - so GL is the SAME item its written
      *>       spelling produces: [012].
      *>
      *> NGA / NGB  A GROUP-LEVEL VALUE over a NATIONAL GROUP, which is the one group shape whose
      *>       subordinate numeric items may be national at all. 13.18.29.3 SR3: "All elementary items
      *>       subordinate to the subject of the entry shall be explicitly or implicitly described as
      *>       usage national" - and the rule contemplates numeric ones by name ("Any signed numeric
      *>       data items shall be described with the SIGN IS SEPARATE clause"). 13.18.63.3 SR14's
      *>       usage-DISPLAY requirement is written about items "subordinate to an alphanumeric group
      *>       item" and so does not reach here; SR5 requires the group VALUE literal to be a NATIONAL
      *>       literal, and 13.18.63.4 GR5 - "If a VALUE clause is specified in a data description
      *>       entry of a group item, the group area is initialized without consideration for the
      *>       individual elementary or group items contained within this group" - deposits it
      *>       POSITIONALLY. 13.18.29.4 GR2b measures that area as "PICTURE N(m), where m is the
      *>       length of the group": NGA's 2 national positions + NGB's 3 = 5, so N"AB123" fills it
      *>       exactly and the members take positions 1-2 and 3-5: [AB] and [123]. That is the same
      *>       distribution the ALPHANUMERIC twin AGA/AGB gets from "AB123" - the national form
      *>       differs only in 13.18.60.4 GR8's per-character size (design D-N7), never in which
      *>       characters land where.
      *>
      *> NNUM(2:2)  8.4.3.3.4 GR3: "If the data item referenced by identifier-1 is explicitly or
      *>       implicitly described as usage NATIONAL and its category is other than national, it is
      *>       operated upon for purposes of reference modification as if it were redefined as a data
      *>       item of class and category national of the same size", and GR6c makes the slice class
      *>       and category NATIONAL. Over [124] the slice is positions 2-3: [24]. Table 16's National
      *>       row then admits the national receiver.
      *>
      *> NUMERIC class condition: 8.8.4.4.4 - "If the usage of the data item referenced by identifier-1
      *>       is implicitly or explicitly display or national, the condition is true if the presence or
      *>       absence of an operational sign ... is in agreement with the data description ... and if
      *>       the content, except for the operational sign, consists entirely of the characters 0, 1,
      *>       2, 3, ..., 9" - true for both NNUM and NSGN.
      *>
      *> The BYTE image is pinned by conformance:2023/pb646_national_form_numeric_bytes (a REDEFINES
      *> over the same items) and the 85 rejection by
