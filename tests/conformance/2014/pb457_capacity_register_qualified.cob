      *> kb/Work PB457 - a QUALIFIED reference to an OCCURS DYNAMIC CAPACITY register.
      *> ISO 13.18.38.3 SR30: "Data-name-3 shall not be defined elsewhere in the source element. If qualifiers
      *> are required for uniqueness, it shall be treated as though implicitly defined at the same level as the
      *> entry containing the OCCURS clause" - so WS-CAP stands beside WS-E and WS-TABLE qualifies it.
      *> ISO 8.4.2.2.3 SR2: "A name may be qualified even though it does not need qualification" - both the OF
      *> and the IN spelling (8.4.2.2.2 Format 1) are legal on a name that is already unique.
      *> Expected values are DERIVED, not measured:
      *>   INIT  - 8.5.1.9.1 "may be initialized explicitly in the FROM phrase" + 13.18.38.4 GR16
      *>           ("integer-4 is the minimum capacity") => 2.
      *>   TO    - 14.9.39.4 GR30a: the new capacity is arithmetic-expression-4 => 7.
      *>   UP    - GR30b: 7 + 2 => 9.
      *>   DOWN  - GR30c: 9 - 8 => 1, and "If the new capacity of the table is less than the minimum capacity
      *>           defined in the corresponding OCCURS clause, the new capacity of the table shall be the
      *>           minimum capacity" => 2.
      *>   SUM   - the register is a sending arithmetic operand (13.18.38.4 GR15, "a numeric data item that
      *>           contains the current capacity of the associated table"): 2 + 1 => 3.
      *>   COND  - the same value in a relation condition => YES.
