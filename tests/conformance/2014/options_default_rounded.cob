      *> ISO §11.9.6 — COBOL-2002 OPTIONS paragraph DEFAULT ROUNDED MODE. It sets the rounding mode used by a
      *> *bare* ROUNDED phrase (one with no per-statement MODE IS). Here NEAREST-EVEN (banker's rounding) gives
      *> 2.5 -> 2, 3.5 -> 4, 0.5 -> 0 — visibly distinct from the ISO default NEAREST-AWAY-FROM-ZERO, which
      *> would give 3, 4, 1. (A per-statement ROUNDED MODE IS … still overrides this program default.)
