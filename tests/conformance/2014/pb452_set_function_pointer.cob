      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §14.9.39.2 Format 8 (function-pointer-assignment) end to end, at the edition the
      *> category was introduced. kb/Work PB452 + PB817.
      *>
      *> §13.18.60.4 GR26 — "A data description entry that specifies the USAGE FUNCTION-POINTER clause
      *> specifies a function-pointer data item … that may contain the address of a function"; the TO phrase is
      *> unbracketed in the printed general format (folio 503), so FP1/FP2 are restricted to PBF8DBL.
      *> §8.4.3.12.4 GR1 b) / GR2 — ADDRESS OF FUNCTION function-prototype-name-1 yields the address of the
      *> function identified by the externalized function-name in its FUNCTION-ID paragraph.
      *> §14.9.39.4 GR14 — "The address identified by identifier-13 is stored in each data item referenced by
      *> identifier-12 in the order specified."
      *> §8.8.4.2.16 — two function-pointers are equal when they identify the same function, or are both NULL.
      *> §8.4.3.10.4 GR2 — the predefined address NULL is guaranteed not to be any function's address.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, derived line by line:
      *>   BOTH-SET   FP1 and FP2 both hold PBF8DBL's address after the two receivers are set in one statement
      *>              (GR14's "each data item referenced by identifier-12"), so neither equals NULL.
      *>   SAME       FP3 took FP1's address through the plain Format-8 carrier copy, so FP3 = FP1 (§8.8.4.2.16).
      *>   NULL1      SET FP1 TO NULL stores the predefined NULL function address in FP1 only …
      *>   NOTNULL3   … and leaves FP3, an independent item, holding the address (GR14 changes only identifier-12).
      *>   OF-OPTIONAL  `SET FP2 TO ADDRESS FUNCTION PBF8DBL` — OF is NOT underlined in the printed
      *>              §8.4.3.12.2 figure (folio 141), so §8.3.2.4.3 makes the OF-less spelling conforming and it
      *>              must produce the very same address: FP2 = FP3 again.
      *>
      *> BEFORE/AFTER 000000042 IS THE ANNEX A.1 ITEM 174 WITNESS (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §7 row DOC-A.1-174).
      *> §14.9.39.4 GR15 makes "the effect of the SET statement on the function whose address is being stored
      *> in the function-pointer" implementor-defined, and this implementation's determination is NONE: the
      *> function is neither activated nor initialized nor otherwise disturbed. Activating PBF8DBL(21) before
      *> the first SET and after the last one must therefore print the identical 000000042 both times.
