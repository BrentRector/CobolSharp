      *> ISO §13.18.63.3 SR35 (VALUE) and §13.18.53.3 SR6 (SOURCE) carry no version proviso, Annex E lists no
      *> 2014→2023 change to either, and the repetition vehicle they require — §13.15.4 GR3's "a LINE or COLUMN
      *> clause with more than one operand" — has existed since COBOL-2002 along with the COLUMNS/ARE and SOURCES
      *> spellings.  So the whole construct shall compile and run at COBOL-2014 exactly as it does at 2002 and
      *> 2023, and there is no gating diagnostic to check here: nothing this program writes is edition-gated at
      *> 2014.  The binder's operand list, the SR35/SR6 screen and the emitter's cycling all carry no version
      *> predicate, so a divergence between the editions could only come from a gate — which would show up here
      *> as a COBOLNET0900 rejection.

      *> WHY THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT READ THE REPORT FILE BACK, and the 2023 twin does.  The read-back needs
      *> ORGANIZATION IS LINE SEQUENTIAL, which is itself a COBOL-2023 introduction (§12.4.5.10.3 GR2 — the
      *> Foreword lists it among the main changes over ISO/IEC 1989:2014), so it cannot appear in a COBOL-2014
      *> program at all (the kb/Work PB688 precedent, which removed exactly this read-back from an 85 fixture).
      *> The CONTENT assertions therefore live in the 2023 twin.

      *> DERIVATION OF THE EXPECTED OUTPUT.  One INITIATE, two GENERATEs of the same TYPE DE group, one TERMINATE;
      *> nothing is control-broken and nothing is suppressed, so the program simply reaches its final DISPLAY.
