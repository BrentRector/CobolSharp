      *> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.32.4 GR4 a): `RELEASE record-name-1 FROM literal-1` is "MOVE literal-1 TO
      *> record-name-1 according to the rules specified for the MOVE statement", followed by the same
      *> RELEASE without the FROM phrase.  This program writes that statement beside the explicit pair
      *> and displays the record area after each, so "equivalent" is what is measured.
      *> DERIVATION.  14.9.25.3 SR5 permits an alphanumeric figurative constant to move to a numeric
      *> receiver at this edition, and Table 16 makes it an alphanumeric-to-alphanumeric move of the
      *> quotation-mark character into the receiver's three character positions, so both the FROM form
      *> and the explicit MOVE leave SRT-NUM holding three quotation marks; 14.9.40.4 GR8 a) then
      *> returns the two equal-keyed records unchanged.  Every displayed line is three quotation marks
      *> inside [ ].
      *> WHY THIS EXACT PROGRAM (kb/Work PB348).  `MOVE QUOTE TO SRT-NUM` + `RELEASE SRT-NUM` ran; the
      *> equivalent `RELEASE SRT-NUM FROM QUOTE` ABORTED THE RUN with an unhandled
      *> NotImplementedCobolFeatureException before the record was released, so the sort never
      *> completed.  The cause was not a missing rule but a missing FACT: MoveBinder marks the numeric
      *> DISPLAY receiver image-forced, StorageFormPass consumes that mark, and the implicit move was
      *> being constructed in the EMITTER -- downstream of both.  Its 2023 twin, where the same
      *> statement is REMOVED, is conformance:negative/pb348-release-from-quote-numeric-removed-2023.
      *> The 2002 leg: SR5's sender is VALID here, with no diagnostic at all.
