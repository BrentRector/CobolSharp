      *> ISO §14.9.37.4 GR1 b) 3 — "If the AT END phrase is not
      *> specified and neither exception condition was raised because
      *> the checking for those exception conditions was not enabled,
      *> control is transferred to the end of the SEARCH statement."
      *> §14.6.13.1.1: "By default, checking is not enabled for any
      *> exception condition", and this program contains no TURN
      *> directive and no declaratives, so no applicable exception
      *> processing statement exists and GR1b2 cannot apply either.
      *> Both unsuccessful shapes GR4 defines are run with no AT END
      *> phrase, and each is followed by a DISPLAY that can only be
      *> reached if control was transferred to the end of the SEARCH:
      *>   A1 — a valid initial index whose scan exhausts the table
      *>        (the EC-RANGE-SEARCH-NO-MATCH shape);
      *>   A2 — an initial index of zero, which GR4 calls unsuccessful
      *>        before any comparison (the EC-RANGE-SEARCH-INDEX
      *>        shape). §13.18.38.4 GR2 guarantees an index accepts at
      *>        least occurrence (1 - 5), so SET IX TO 0 is legal here.
      *> The L23-EC line pins the OTHER conjunct of GR1b3's premise,
      *> that neither condition was RAISED. §14.6.13.1.1: "if checking
      *> for an exception that occurs is not enabled, no exception
      *> condition is raised", so the last exception status still
      *> indicates that no exception condition exists and §15.33.3
      *> rule 1 returns 31 alphanumeric spaces. Without that line a
      *> compiler that wrongly enabled EC-RANGE checking by default
      *> would print exactly the same output: both conditions are
      *> nonfatal (Table 13) and no declarative exists, so control
      *> would still reach the end of the SEARCH — green for a reason
      *> that is not GR1b3.
      *> The final line proves the run unit continued past both.
