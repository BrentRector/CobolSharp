      *> kb/Work PB956 -- BASED data and ADDRESS OF targets in every data division a class definition has.
      *> ISO 13.16.3 SR16: the BASED clause "may be specified only in data description entries in the linkage
      *> section, in the working-storage section, and in the local-storage section" -- all three of which a
      *> factory, an instance and a method definition have; 13.18.5.3 bars only a class-object subject and a
      *> dynamic-length / variable-length subject. 8.6.4: local-storage items are "allocated and set to initial
      *> state each time the runtime element containing them is activated", so each recursive REC activation
      *> owns its own LV and its own LB address; 13.18.5.4 GR2: every implicit data-address pointer starts NULL.
      *> Expected output, from those rules:
      *>   FACTORY  ALLOCATE FB INITIALIZED (14.9.3.4 GR7 -- as INITIALIZE ... TO DEFAULT: FB2 = zero) + 7  -> F:HI007
      *>   REC(0) -> REC(1) -> REC(2): each LB addresses ITS OWN activation's LV ("L0 ", "L1 ", "L2 "),
      *>     printed innermost first, then re-based onto the object's OW ("OBJ").
      *>   WSM twice: method WORKING-STORAGE is static data (8.6.4), so WP keeps the address of WC and the
      *>     second activation adds to the same WC -> W:1, W:2.
      *>   GET property PV reads the object item whose address M1 took (the record now lives on a cell).
