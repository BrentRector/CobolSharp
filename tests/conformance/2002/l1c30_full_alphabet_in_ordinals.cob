      *> ISO 12.3.7.3 SR17 c5 / SR16 f1 IN arm - the ordinals of an
      *> alphabet that names ALL 65,536 native national characters
      *> (kb/Work PB1557; golden-lane-2 misc-p30 row SR-12.3.7.3-L7.5).
      *>
      *> An ALPHABET whose literal phrase names every native character
      *> is legal: SR14 c4 says the count "shall not exceed" the native
      *> count, so EQUAL is legal (cite.py --check 12.3.7.3 "The number
      *> of characters specified shall not exceed the number of
      *> characters in the native national character set" -> OK
      *> 12.3.7.3 14)). Its coded character set then has 65,536
      *> ordinals, each naming the character at that collating position
      *> (GR7 k2; DOC-A.1-186):
      *>   cite.py --check 12.3.7.3 "the number of characters in the
      *>     character set referenced by alphabet-name-4."
      *>     -> OK 12.3.7.3 17)
      *>   cite.py --check 12.3.7.3 "the ordinal position specified by
      *>     integer-1 shall exist in that character set"
      *>     -> OK 12.3.7.3 16)
      *>   cite.py --check 12.3.7.4 "The order in which the literals
      *>     appear in the ALPHABET clause specifies, in ascending
      *>     sequence, the ordinal number of the character within the
      *>     collating sequence being specified." -> OK 12.3.7.4 7) 2.

      *> WHY IT CAN FAIL: the binder counted the alphabet's positions in
      *> a 16-bit counter that wrapped 65,536 to 0, so every ordinal of
      *> NREV "did not exist" - the CLASS clause drew COBOLNET1671 and the
      *> SYMBOLIC CHARACTERS clause COBOLNET1670 on legal source.
      *>
      *> DERIVATION: NREV = 65536 THRU 1, so ordinal 1 of NREV is U+FFFF
      *> and ordinal 65536 is U+0000; GR12's THROUGH takes the contiguous
      *> native characters between them = every character, so N"(EURO)A"
      *> IS NIN -> EURO-A-IN-NIN=Y. SYMBOLIC CHARACTERS S66 IS 66 IN NREV
      *> names the character at position 66 = native ordinal 65537-66 =
      *> 65471 = U+FFBE; FUNCTION ORD of it under the NREV national PCS
      *> is its position (15.70.1) -> ORD-S66=00066. N"B" < N"A" under
      *> NREV (8.8.4.2.9; native says N) -> NB-LT-NA=Y.
