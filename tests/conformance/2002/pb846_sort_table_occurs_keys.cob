      *> §14.9.40.2 — the printed Format 2 (folio 746, RENDERED) BRACKETS the KEY phrase, where Format 1 braces it.
      *> §14.9.40.3 SR15 — "The KEY phrase may be omitted only if the description of the table referenced by
      *>   data-name-2 contains a KEY phrase."
      *> §14.9.40.4 GR21 — "If the KEY phrase is not specified, the sequence is determined by the KEY phrase in the
      *>   data description entry of the table referenced by data-name-2."
      *> §13.18.38.4 GR3 — the OCCURS KEY data-names are "specified in descending order of significance", and each
      *>   carries its own ASCENDING/DESCENDING (§14.9.40.4 GR1's transitivity is the same shape).

      *>                   GR3), so every B precedes every A; within equal KA, KB ascends. Elements are loaded
