      *> ISO 12.3.8.2 (rendered PDF p334-335 / folios 304-305) prints `[ AS literal-n ]`, AS underlined, on
      *> EVERY specifier that names an externalized entity:
      *>     CLASS object-class-name-1 [ AS literal-1 ] [ EXPANDS ... ]
      *>     INTERFACE interface-name-2 [ AS literal-2 ] [ EXPANDS ... ]
      *>     PROGRAM program-prototype-name-1 [ AS literal-3 ]
      *>     PROPERTY property-name-1 [ AS literal-4 ]
      *>     FUNCTION function-prototype-name-1 [ AS literal-5 ]
      *> and the intrinsic-function-specifier as `FUNCTION { intrinsic-function-name-1 } ... INTRINSIC`.
      *> 12.3.8.4 GR2: "If the AS phrase is specified, literal-1, literal-2, literal-3, or literal-5 is the
      *> externalized name by which the class, interface, function, or program, respectively, is known to the
      *> operating environment." So the WORD the program writes is a local name, and it names the definition
      *> whose externalized name is the literal - here each definition is declared with a DIFFERENT word and an
      *> AS literal of its own (11.3.2 CLASS-ID / 11.6.2 INTERFACE-ID / 11.5.2 FUNCTION-ID), so only the
      *> literal can connect the two. kb/Work PB974: every one of these specifiers except PROGRAM refused
      *> `AS` with COBOLNET0901, and `FUNCTION PI E INTRINSIC` died COBOL0307.
