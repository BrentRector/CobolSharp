      *> ISO 13.16.3 SR9, the VALUE-implied PICTURE (kb/Work PB504; the ALL-literal length is kb/Work PB831,
      *> the figurative admission is kb/Work PB828).  The rule had NO implementation site: BindEntry's pic
      *> chain is keyed on USAGE and has no arm keyed on the VALUE literal, so every program below was either
      *> rejected by the 13.16.3 SR8 closing guard or, for the figurative spellings, given the ONE-CHARACTER
      *> recovery item and silently truncated.  Every value here is derived from the standard.
      *>
      *> 13.16.3 SR9: "The PICTURE clause may be omitted for an elementary item when an alphanumeric, boolean,
      *> or national literal that is not a zero-length literal is specified in the data-item format of the
      *> VALUE clause.  A PICTURE clause is implied as follows: a) if the literal is alphanumeric,
      *> 'PICTURE X(length)' b) if the literal is boolean, 'PICTURE 1(length)' c) if the literal is national,
      *> 'PICTURE N(length)' where length is the length of the literal as specified in 8.3.3, Literals."
      *> 8.3.3.6.4 GR3: the length of a figurative constant whose context does not specify one - "b) When a
      *> figurative constant is other than ALL literal-1, the length of the string is one character.
      *> ... c) The length of the string is the length of literal-1."
      *> 8.3.3.6.4 GR1: a figurative constant "used in a context requiring national characters ... represents
      *> a national character value.  Otherwise ... an alphanumeric character value."
      *> 13.18.60.3 SR13 a): "if the explicit or IMPLICIT picture character-string contains the symbol 'N', a
      *> USAGE NATIONAL clause is implied" - the standard's own word for what SR9 supplies.
      *>
      *> DERIVATIONS (15.50.4 - FUNCTION LENGTH is the item's character positions):
      *>   ALNUM  "HELLO" is alphanumeric, 5 characters      -> SR9 a) PICTURE X(5), value HELLO,  LENGTH 5
      *>   HEXAL  X"414243" is alphanumeric (8.3.3.2), and 8.3.3.2.3 r6 groups its digits two per character
      *>          -> 3 characters                            -> SR9 a) PICTURE X(3), value ABC,    LENGTH 3
      *>   NATNL  N"HELLO" is national, 5 characters         -> SR9 c) PICTURE N(5), value HELLO,  LENGTH 5
      *>   BOOLN  B"1011" is boolean, 4 boolean characters   -> SR9 b) PICTURE 1(4), value 1011,   LENGTH 4
      *>   FIGSP  SPACE is not ALL literal-1, so GR3 b) gives length 1; GR1's "otherwise" arm makes it
      *>          alphanumeric                               -> SR9 a) PICTURE X(1), value " ",    LENGTH 1
      *>   ALLAB  ALL "AB" IS ALL literal-1, so GR3 c) gives literal-1's length, 2
      *>                                                     -> SR9 a) PICTURE X(2), value AB,     LENGTH 2
      *>   ALLA   ALL "A"  - the same rule at length 1       -> SR9 a) PICTURE X(1), value A,      LENGTH 1
      *>   NATSP  A VALUE SPACE under a group whose USAGE NATIONAL clause applies to it (13.18.60.4 GR1) is a
      *>          context requiring national characters, so GR1's first arm and GR3 b) give it
      *>                                                     -> SR9 c) PICTURE N(1),                LENGTH 1
      *>   NATAB  ALL N"AB" - GR3 c) on a national literal-1 -> SR9 c) PICTURE N(2), value AB,     LENGTH 2
      *>   GROUP  the implied member composes into its group's character image exactly as a written one does:
      *>          X(5) "HELLO" then X(3) "XYZ"               -> HELLOXYZ, LENGTH 8
