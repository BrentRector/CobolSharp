      *> ISO §14.9.39.3 — SET format 5 with the predefined object reference SELF as the sender.
      *> The RECEIVER's §13.18.60.2 description picks the rule: SR10 d) for an interface-name
      *> receiver, SR12 c) for an object-class-name receiver.  Both are keyed to the FACTORY /
      *> INSTANCE axis, because SELF is the FACTORY object inside a factory method and an
      *> INSTANCE object inside an instance method.  kb/Work PB451.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE RULES — NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>
      *> 1-2. INVOKE PB451P "FMK" runs a method of PB451P's FACTORY definition.
      *>    SET FR TO SELF, with FR described FACTORY OF PB451P, is SR12 c): c)1. is satisfied
      *>    (no ONLY phrase), c)2. "the class containing the SET statement shall be the same
      *>    class or a subclass of the class specified in the description" (PB451P is PB451P),
      *>    and c)4. "if the data item referenced by identifier-3 is described with a FACTORY
      *>    phrase, the method containing the SET statement shall be defined in the factory
      *>    definition of its containing class" — it is.  INVOKE FR "TAG" resolves the FACTORY
      *>    roster (§9.3.6):                                                          FTAG-P
      *>    SET JR TO SELF, with JR described with interface-name PB451J, is SR10 d)1.: "if
      *>    the SET statement is contained in a method within the factory definition of the
      *>    class, that factory definition shall be described with an IMPLEMENTS clause that
      *>    references int-1."  PB451P's FACTORY carries IMPLEMENTS PB451K, and PB451K
      *>    INHERITS FROM PB451J, so §11.4.4 GR2 b) ("the factory object implements an
      *>    interface that inherits int-1") makes it implement PB451J — the relation §11.4.4
      *>    GR1 says the clause names.  INVOKE JR "PING":                            FPING-P
      *>
      *> 3. INVOKE PB451Q "QFMK" runs a method of PB451Q's FACTORY definition, which carries
      *>    NO IMPLEMENTS clause at all; only its base PB451P's does.  §11.4.4 GR2 c) — "the
      *>    class containing the factory object inherits a class whose factory object
      *>    implements int-1" — is the leg that makes SR10 d)1. hold here.  PB451Q's FACTORY
      *>    overrides PING:                                                         FPING-Q
      *>    DISCRIMINATOR: this is the sharpest of the SR10 d) legs — a definition with no
      *>    IMPLEMENTS clause AT ALL — so a literal reading of "described with an IMPLEMENTS
      *>    clause that references int-1" refuses it, and printing FPING-P instead would mean
      *>    SELF had been resolved to the BASE factory object rather than the active one.
      *>
      *> 4-5. INVOKE OP "MK" runs an INSTANCE method of PB451P on a PB451P object.
      *>    SET O2 TO SELF, O2 described with the object-class-name PB451P, is SR12 c)2. plus
      *>    c)3. "if the data item referenced by identifier-3 is described without a FACTORY
      *>    phrase, the method containing the SET statement shall be defined in the instance
      *>    definition of its containing class" — it is.  INVOKE O2 "WHO":            WHO-P
      *>    SET J2 TO SELF is SR10 d)2., the instance twin, over §11.8.4 GR2 b):     IPING-P
      *>
      *> 6-7. INVOKE OQ "QMK" runs an INSTANCE method of PB451Q on a PB451Q object.
      *>    SET PR TO SELF, PR described with the object-class-name PB451P, is SR12 c)2.'s
      *>    SUBCLASS leg: the class containing the SET (PB451Q) is a subclass of PB451P.
      *>    INVOKE PR "WHO" dispatches on the object actually held:                   WHO-Q
      *>    SET J2 TO SELF is SR10 d)2. over §11.8.4 GR2 c) — PB451Q's OBJECT carries no
      *>    IMPLEMENTS clause; its base PB451P's does.  INVOKE J2 "PING":           IPING-Q
      *>
      *> 8. SET OQ TO NULL is SR12 d), the fourth member of the rule's closed list of
      *>    senders — "the predefined object reference NULL" — into a receiver described
      *>    with an object-class-name.  §13.18.60.4 GR22 makes null a legal content of
      *>    every object reference ("It shall contain either null or a reference to an
      *>    object"), so the assignment is unconditional: no class relation, no FACTORY or
      *>    ONLY axis, nothing to check.  §8.8.4.2.15 then observes it — "An operand of
      *>    class object may be compared with another operand of class object", true when
      *>    both reference the same object:                                       NULLOK
      *>    DISCRIMINATOR: the line runs after OQ has held a real PB451Q object, so it
      *>    proves the SET cleared it rather than reporting an initial value.
      *>
      *> The rejecting arms are fixtures, one clause each:
      *> conformance:negative/pb451-self-sender-factory-method-instance-receiver (SR12 c)3.),
