      *> kb/Work PB739 at the COBOL-2002 FLOOR - two file connectors
      *> extending ONE shared physical file, interleaved WRITE by WRITE.
      *>
      *> The full matrix is 2023/pb739_shared_extend_write; this is the
      *> subset the edition floor admits, and the split is a fact about
      *> the constructs rather than a convenience: ORGANIZATION IS LINE
      *> SEQUENTIAL is COBOL-2023 (12.4.5.10.3 GR2; kb/Work PB688) while
      *> SHARING and LOCK MODE are COBOL-2002. What survives here is
      *> record sequential FIXED width, record sequential RECORD VARYING,
      *> the LOCK MODE-only sharing spelling, the exclusive control, and
      *> the RELATIVE and INDEXED organizations.
      *>
      *> THE RULES. 14.9.51.4 GR19: "If two or more file connectors for a
      *> sequential file add records by sharing the physical file after
      *> opening it in extend mode, the added records follow the records
      *> present in the physical file when it was opened, but are
      *> otherwise in an undefined order." GR12: "The successful execution
      *> of a WRITE statement releases a logical record to the operating
      *> environment." Both added records shall be in the file; only their
      *> relative ORDER is undefined, and the order printed below is this
      *> compiler's determinate choice inside that latitude (GR12 releases
      *> each record at its own WRITE, so they land in statement order).
      *> 9.1.15 3) makes the shape legal and 14.9.27.4 Table 19 makes
      *> ALL OTHER/EXTEND against ALL OTHER/EXTEND a Normal open.
      *>
      *> RELATIVE. 14.9.51.4 GR29 a): the extend release is "one greater
      *> than the highest relative record number existing in the physical
      *> file", and "If the physical file is shared and the open mode is
      *> extend, the record numbers are not necessarily consecutive" -
      *> the number is read from the file AT THE RELEASE, so A gets 0002
      *> over a file holding RRN 1 and B gets 0003 once A has released.
      *> GR31 says the same from the other side.
      *>
      *> INDEXED. 14.9.51.4 GR38 measures the extend high key "when it was
      *> opened THROUGH THAT FILE CONNECTOR", so B - opened when the file
      *> held only K002 - may release K004 after A has released K006.
