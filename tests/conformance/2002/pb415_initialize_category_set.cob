      *> ISO §14.9.20.2 category-name IS A SET, and eight of its thirteen words were unspellable.
      *> The printed general format (licensed PDF p667 / folio 637) encloses THIRTEEN underlined category
      *> names in a BRACE carrying CHOICE INDICATORS; §5.2.6.4 reads those "one or more of the alternatives
      *> contained within the choice indicators shall be specified, but any single alternative shall be
      *> specified only once". The grammar carried a single-alternative rule naming five, so this whole file
      *> was COBOL0001 before kb/Work PB415.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED BEFORE THE RUN:
      *> T1  REPLACING ALPHABETIC ALPHANUMERIC DATA BY "ZZ" — ONE category-name naming TWO categories
      *>     (§5.2.6.4). GR5c2 qualifies AB (§8.5.2.2 alphabetic) and AN (§8.5.2.3 alphanumeric); §14.9.20.4 GR6b's
      *>     sender is literal-1 "ZZ"; GR4's implicit MOVE left-justifies and space-fills to 3 → "ZZ ".
      *>     NU/NA/BO name no category in the phrase, so GR5c leaves them unchanged (GR5c4's premise is
      *>     false — the REPLACING phrase IS specified). → ZZ / ZZ / 123 / pqr / 0000
      *> T2  REPLACING NATIONAL DATA BY N"ab" — one of the eight words PB415 landed. Only NA is category
      *>     national (§8.5.2.10); the implicit MOVE pads with the national space → "ab ". → ZZ/ZZ/123/ab /0000
      *> T3  REPLACING NATIONAL-EDITED DATA BY N"zz" — conforming source that matches NO receiving operand:
      *>     national-edited (§8.5.2.11) is a DIFFERENT category from national (§8.5.2.10), so §14.9.20.4 GR5c2 selects
      *>     nothing and every item is left unchanged. Nothing changes.
      *> T4  REPLACING BOOLEAN DATA BY B"11" — only BO is category boolean (§8.5.2.5); the boolean MOVE
      *>     left-justifies and zero-fills right (§14.9.25.3) → "1100".
      *> T5  TWO REPLACING items, the first again a two-category category-name: AB and AN take "Q" → "Q  ",
      *>     NU takes 7 → 007 (§14.9.20.3 SR6 is satisfied — no category is repeated across the items).
      *> T6  ALL TO VALUE (the braced choice spelled in full, §14.9.20.2 + §5.2.6.3): GR5c1b qualifies every
      *>     item that carries a data-item format VALUE clause and GR6a3 restores that literal — AB/AN/NU/NA.
      *>     BO has no VALUE clause and is not one of GR5c1a's categorical categories, so it is NOT a
      *>     receiving operand and keeps T4's 1100.
