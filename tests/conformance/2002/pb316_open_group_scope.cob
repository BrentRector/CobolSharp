      *> kb/Work PB316 - the OPEN statement's general format (ISO
      *> 14.9.27.2) has TWO nested brace pairs. The OUTER pair encloses
      *> the whole group
      *>     {open-mode} [sharing-phrase] [retry-phrase]
      *>                                {file-name-1 [WITH NO REWIND]} ...
      *> and carries its own trailing ellipsis, so the sharing- and
      *> retry-phrases sit INSIDE the repeated group, beside the open mode
      *> and the file-names they govern - confirmed against the printed
      *> page, not only the transcription.
      *>
      *> 14.9.27.4 GR20 then fixes the semantics: "If more than one
      *> file-name is specified in an OPEN statement, the result of
      *> executing this OPEN statement is the same as if a separate OPEN
      *> statement had been written for each file-name in the same order
      *> as specified in the OPEN statement. These separate OPEN
      *> statements would each have the same open mode specification, the
      *> sharing-phrase, retry-phrase, and REWIND phrase as specified in
      *> the OPEN statement." The open mode in that list is unarguably
      *> per group - a multi-group OPEN exists to open files in differing
      *> modes - so the phrases listed beside it are per group too.
      *> 14.9.27.4 GR23 bounds the other direction: "If there is no
      *> SHARING phrase on the OPEN statement, then file sharing is
      *> completely specified in the file control entry."
      *>
      *> THE SHAPE OF THE TEST: every arbitration below is written TWICE -
      *> once as separate OPEN statements (GR20's own reference form) and
      *> once as one statement with the same groups - and the two forms
      *> shall print the same statuses. That is GR20 asserted directly,
      *> and it does not depend on any implementor-defined default.

      *> phrase gets treated as a file-sharing participant, which changes
      *> what LATER opens arbitrate against and so escapes the statement.
      *> GR20's reference form first: F-SEED, whose group carries no
      *> phrase and whose file control entry specifies no sharing, then a
      *> retry group on F-E, then an OPEN of the no-other connector F-A
      *> while F-SEED is still open.

      *> three statuses to match (1) exactly: F-SEED's group carries
      *> neither phrase, so by GR23 its sharing stays whatever its file

      *> in the INPUT mode against that existing no-other connector,

      *> "sharing with no other") makes an "Unsuccessful open" - I-O
      *> status '61', 9.1.13.9 item 1. F-B is therefore NOT open and is
      *> not closed. These two parts come LAST among the shared-file

      *> control entry for file-name-1 or if the ALL phrase is specified

      *> no sharing phrase and F-C's file control entry carries no
      *> SHARING clause, so neither antecedent holds for F-C and its
      *> missing LOCK MODE clause is legal. The ALL phrase belongs to
