      *> range. 13.18.63.4 GR18 defers the whole question: "The manner of determining the range of values
      *> specified by the THROUGH phrase is described in 14.7.8, THROUGH phrase." 14.7.8 rule 2: with no
      *> phrase "the collating sequence is defined by the implementor" (this compiler's default is the
      *> PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE); "when the IN alphabet-name phrase is specified, the collating sequence
      *> used for range evaluation is the collating sequence defined by that alphabet"; "the range of values
      *> includes all values collating at the starting value and all successive ascending values in the
      *> applicable collating sequence up to and including all values collating at the ending value"; and
      *> "when the value of literal-1 is greater than the value of literal-2 in the collating sequence in
      *> effect at runtime, the EC-RANGE-INVALID exception condition is set to exist, and, upon completion of
      *> any exception processing, execution proceeds as if the range of values were empty."
      *>
      *> ⛔ NO PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE IS DECLARED, AND THAT IS THE POINT. kb/Work PB502's arm of the
      *> phrase (the VALUE clause; the EVALUATE twin is PB398) was PARSED AND DROPPED, a silent wrong answer,
      *> and the sibling golden 2002/pb398_range_in_alphabet cannot catch its return: that program names the
      *> SAME alphabet in PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE, so its level-88 legs answer identically whether the IN
      *> phrase is read or discarded. Here rule 2's no-phrase arm resolves to the NATIVE sequence and every
      *> IN leg below is the OPPOSITE of its no-phrase twin, so dropping the phrase again flips a line.

      *> POSITIONS. `ALPHABET ALPHA-REV IS "Z" THRU "A"` - 12.3.7.4 GR7 k) 5.: "if the THROUGH phrase is
      *> specified, the set of consecutive characters in the native character set beginning with the
      *> character specified by the value of literal-1, and ending with the character specified by the value
      *> of literal-2, is assigned a successive ascending position in the collating sequence being
      *> specified", and that set "may specify characters of the native character set in either ascending or
      *> descending sequence"; GR7 k) 2. is the same ascending-order rule for a literal list. So Z=1, Y=2 ...
      *> A=26, giving Q=10, P=11, O=12, M=14, D=23. GR7 k) 3. places every unlisted character above them.

      *>
      *> THE EXCEPTION IS MEASURED ON THE NAMED SEQUENCE, NOT THE NATIVE ONE, and the two EXCEPTION-STATUS

      *> in the sequence rule 2 puts it under - so no exception exists yet and FUNCTION EXCEPTION-STATUS
      *> returns spaces. Evaluating B then sets EC-RANGE-INVALID. Read the pair together: legs A and E are
