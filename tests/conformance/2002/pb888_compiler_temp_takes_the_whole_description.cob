      *> kb/Work PB888 - a compiler TEMPORARY takes the WHOLE description of the item it stands for.

      *> THE RULE. ISO 8.4.3.2.4 GR1: "the description, class, and category of the temporary data item is
      *> that specified by the description in the linkage section of the item specified in the RETURNING
      *> phrase". The whole entry - not a chosen subset of its clauses - so a RETURNING item described with
      *> GROUP-USAGE NATIONAL (13.18.29) yields a temporary that IS a national group. 14.9.25.4 GR1 makes the
      *> same demand of the intermediate result item of a multi-receiver MOVE: "MOVE a (b) TO b, c (b)" is
      *> equivalent to "MOVE a (b) TO temp / MOVE temp TO b / MOVE temp to c (b)", so each receiver owes
      *> exactly what a single-receiver MOVE of the same sender gives.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED - never measured.
      *>   15.50.4 r2: LENGTH of a national group item counts NATIONAL character positions, so the
      *>     function result over 02 PIC N(4) is 4 - the same as its byte-identical working-storage control.
      *>   13.18.29.4 GR2 b): a national group "is treated as though it were an elementary data item of usage
      *>     national and class and category national described with PICTURE N(m)", so moving the result to
      *>     a PIC N(6) receiver is an elementary national MOVE: "WXYZ" left-justified, space-filled.
      *>   The table element NG(I) over 03 PIC N(3) holding "XYZ" moved to TWO PIC N(6) receivers gives
      *>     "XYZ   " in each, exactly what the one-receiver MOVE gives.
      *> Before the fix both temporaries were cloned from a hand list without GROUP-USAGE: LEN-FN=8, and the
      *> two-receiver MOVE put " X   " where the one-receiver MOVE put "XYZ   ".
      *>
      *> COBOL-2002: user-defined functions and GROUP-USAGE are 2002 introductions - the negative twin
      *> tests/conformance/negative/pb888-national-group-result-below-2002.cob pins the gate below it.
