      *> ISO §15.14.4 r3 FUNCTION BYTE-LENGTH - "The returned value shall include the number of implicit filler
      *> positions, if any, in argument-1" (plus the r4 LEVEL-77 legs, where the standard says filler is NOT
      *> generated and the rounding is therefore the whole answer).
      *>
      *> WHERE IMPLICIT FILLER COMES FROM. §8.5.1.6.3 "Alignment of data items of usage bit" names three sources:
      *>  (a) "Following a bit data item within an alphanumeric group item, within a strongly-typed group item,
      *>      or within a bit group item, as needed to advance alignment to a required natural boundary for the
      *>      next item within that group";
      *>  (b) "Following a bit data item that is the last data item in a record that is an alphanumeric group or
      *>      strongly-typed group item, as needed to increase the number of bits to fill an integral number of
      *>      characters" - §13.18.29.4 GR3: "If a GROUP-USAGE clause is not specified or implied for a group
      *>      item that is not strongly typed and is not a variable-length group, that group item is an
      *>      alphanumeric group item", so this reaches every group below;
      *>  (c) "As defined by the implementor for a bit data item described with the SYNCHRONIZED clause."
      *>
      *> WHICH OF THE THREE A BYTE COUNT CAN SEE - and this golden claims only what it measures.
      *> SOURCE (a) IS DISCRIMINATING and is what the RUN2 / TRAIL / NEST legs are built on: each is sized so that
      *> dropping the interior run CHANGES the answer (RUN2 4 vs 3, TRAIL 3 vs 2, NEST 3/4 vs 2/3). One short run
      *> would be absorbed by r4's ceiling, which is why no leg here carries only one.
      *> SOURCE (b) IS UNOBSERVABLE THROUGH EITHER LENGTH FUNCTION, BY CONSTRUCTION - and this golden says so
      *> instead of claiming a leg for it. All source (b) ever does is complete a PARTIAL TRAILING byte ("as
      *> needed to increase the number of bits to fill an integral number of characters"), and BOTH length rules
      *> round a partial position up regardless: §15.14.4 r4 - "When argument-1 does not occupy an integral number
      *> of bytes, the returned value is rounded to the next larger integer value" - and §15.50.4 r9 - "When the
      *> returned value is expressed as a number of alphanumeric character positions and argument-1 does not
      *> occupy an integral number of positions, the returned value is rounded to the next larger integer value".
      *> Every shape source (b) can reach returns ALPHANUMERIC character positions (§15.50.4 r3; r1's boolean
      *> positions and r2's national positions belong to the shapes §8.5.1.6.3's NOTE excludes from trailing
      *> filler), so the ceiling absorbs it in both functions. Here: TRAIL is 3 with the trailing run and 3
      *> without it (19 bits), ADJ3 is 2 either way (9 bits), NEST is 3 and 4 either way (17 and 25 bits).
      *> ⛔ AND THE SAME HOLDS FOR THE FUNCTION LENGTH GOLDEN OFTEN CREDITED WITH IT. The MIX=4 leg of
      *> conformance:2023/pb43_usage_bit_occupies_bits does NOT discriminate source (b) either - W-MIX is 3 bytes
      *> plus 5 bits, which is 4 character positions with the trailing filler and 4 without it, because r9 rounds.
      *> §15.50.4 r5 ("The returned length shall include the number of implicit FILLER positions, if any, in
      *> argument-1") is SATISFIED by that leg, not WITNESSED by it - a distinction worth writing down, because
      *> the opposite claim is what this golden inherited before the derivation was re-run against r9.
      *> SOURCE (c) IS EXERCISED, AT ZERO, AND THE LEG DISCRIMINATES (SBIT). It reaches "a bit data item
      *> described with the SYNCHRONIZED clause", and there §8.5.1.6.3 hands the implementor BOTH the amount and
      *> the placement - "The implementor defines the positioning rules associated with any filler bit positions"
      *> - because the clause's own ordinary placement rules exclude that shape by their words: "Alignment of
      *> elementary bit data items and bit group items within a record, when neither a SYNCHRONIZED clause nor an
      *> ALIGNED clause is specified, is at the next bit position in storage", and the paragraph below it reaches
      *> only "all other bit data items within a record, when a SYNCHRONIZED clause is not specified".
      *> §13.18.55.4 GR10 withholds even the AUTOMATIC form from the shape - "An implementor may optionally
      *> specify automatic alignment for any internal data representations except for bit data items and, within
      *> a record, data items described with usage display or national" - so nothing but the implementor's own
      *> determination decides it. COBOL.NET's is ZERO filler bit positions, the bit item sitting exactly where
      *> the same item without the clause would (Annex A.1 item 195; CONFORMANCE.md §7 item 195).
      *> SO THIS GOLDEN CLOSES §15.14.4 r3 ON SOURCES (a) AND (c), and states why (b) is not closable here.
      *> BITS PER BYTE. §8.1.2: "The implementor shall specify the number of bits in a byte for each supported
      *> computer." COBOL.NET pins 8 (CONFORMANCE.md §4.2.16; Annex A.1 item 209), which is what turns every bit
      *> count below into its byte answer.
      *>
      *> RUN2  - two INTERIOR filler runs, source (a). Placement is §8.5.1.6.3's second paragraph: a bit item
      *>         whose predecessor is NOT a bit item of the same level falls under "Alignment of all other bit
      *>         data items within a record, when a SYNCHRONIZED clause is not specified, is at the first bit
      *>         position of the first available byte", and the bits skipped to reach the next item's natural
      *>         boundary ARE the filler.
      *>         R2B1 bit 1 | filler 7 | R2A1 bits 9-16 | R2B2 bit 17 | filler 7 | R2A2 bits 25-32.
      *>         data 1+8+1+8 = 18 bits, filler 7+7 = 14, r3 total 32 bits = 4 bytes. Drop source (a) and the
      *>         answer is ceil(18/8) = 3, so 4 is the value only r3 produces.
      *> TRAIL - one interior source-(a) run, across a character item.
      *>         TRB1 bits 1-3 | filler 5 | TRA1 bits 9-16 | TRB2 bits 17-19 | trailing filler 5 = 24 bits = 3.
      *>         Without the source-(a) run the data is 3+8+3 = 14 bits -> ceil(14/8) = 2.
      *> NEST  - the same source ONE LEVEL DEEPER (05/10), and the enclosing group over the result.
      *>         NSI: NSB1 bit 1 | filler 7 | NSA2 bits 9-16 | NSB2 bit 17 | trailing filler 7 = 24 bits = 3.
      *>         NSG: NSA bits 1-8, then NSI (an alphanumeric group, not a bit item, so it starts at the next
      *>         available byte) 24 bits = 32 bits = 4. Without the source-(a) run: 10 and 18 bits -> 2 and 3.
      *> ADJ3  - THREE ADJACENT same-level bit siblings summing to 9 bits, i.e. one run crossing a byte boundary.
      *>         §8.5.1.6.3's first bullet puts "an elementary bit data item immediately following an elementary
      *>         bit data item or bit group item of the same level" at the NEXT BIT POSITION, so the three SHARE
      *>         bits 1-9 and the answer is 2; an implementation giving each sibling its own byte answers 3. This
      *>         leg pins the SHARING rule - the placement r3's count is taken over - not a filler source.
      *> SYNC  - the OTHER implicit-filler law, and it is NOT §8.5.1.6.3's. SYN is a binary NUMERIC item, not a
      *>         bit data item, so §8.5.1.6.3 source (c) does not reach it; the clause that governs it is
      *>         §13.18.55.4 GR9 b) - "Any necessary generation of implicit FILLER, if the elementary item
      *>         immediately preceding an item containing the SYNCHRONIZED clause does not terminate at an
      *>         appropriate natural boundary" - under GR9's "The effect of this clause is defined by the
      *>         implementor". That obligation is Annex A.1 item 195, and COBOL.NET's determination is NO
      *>         physical alignment and NO generated FILLER (CONFORMANCE.md §7 item 195). A COMP 9(4) item is
      *>         2 bytes (item 205: 3-4 digits -> 2), so the group is 1 + 2 = 3. An implementation aligning SYN
      *>         to a 2-byte boundary would answer 4, so the leg measures the determination rather than assuming it.
      *> SBIT  - §8.5.1.6.3 SOURCE (c), the one shape that clause hands to the implementor: a BIT data item
      *>         carrying the SYNCHRONIZED clause. §13.18.55.3 SR1 makes the source legal - "The SYNCHRONIZED
      *>         clause may be specified for group and elementary items" - and no syntax rule excludes a bit item.
      *>         SBB1 and SBB2 are two 3-bit siblings of the SAME level and only SBB2 carries the clause. Under
      *>         the item-195 determination SBB2 sits where an unSYNCHRONIZED sibling would - the shared next bit
      *>         position - so the group is 3+3 = 6 bits, trailing filler 2, = 8 bits = 1 byte. An implementation
      *>         that generated source-(c) filler to byte-align SBB2 answers 8+3 = 11 bits = 2. The leg therefore
      *>         MEASURES the determination instead of restating it, and ADJ3 above is its clause-free control
      *>         (the same sharing, 9 bits, no SYNCHRONIZED anywhere).
      *> L77   - §15.14.4 r4, on the ONE shape §8.5.1.6.3's NOTE excludes from filler entirely: "No filler is
      *>         generated at the end of a record that is entirely a bit group, at the end of a level 77 item,
      *>         or at the end of a level 1 elementary item." A level-77 PIC 1(12) USAGE BIT therefore occupies
      *>         exactly 12 bits - one and a half bytes - and r4 applies: "When argument-1 does not occupy an
      *>         integral number of bytes, the returned value is rounded to the next larger integer value" -> 2.
      *>         L77I is the CONTROL where r4 must NOT fire: 8 bits is an integral byte, so 1, not 2.
