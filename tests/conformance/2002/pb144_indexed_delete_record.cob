       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. PB144IXD.
      *> kb/Work PB144 - the DELETE RECORD legs no fixture has ever
      *> executed. MEASURED before this was written: 37 fixtures mention
      *> INDEXED and NOT ONE issues a DELETE against one, and both DELETE
      *> unit tests build RELATIVE connectors -- so IndexedConnector.Delete
      *> and KeyedIoEmitter's key-slice emission had never run in the
      *> suite. Every expected value below is derived from the rule named
      *> beside it, not from what the code happens to do.
      *>
      *>   IXDEL00 - 14.9.10.4 GR3: indexed + DYNAMIC access, the record
      *>             identified by the PRIME RECORD KEY is removed -> 00.
      *>   IXGONE  - GR5: after successful execution the record "can no
      *>             longer be accessed" -> a random re-READ gives 23.
      *>   IXAREA* - GR8: "The execution of a DELETE RECORD statement does
      *>             not affect the content of the record area." The area
      *>             is DISPLAYed before AND after, and the two must be
      *>             identical. The probe READS the area rather than
      *>             noting that the code does not write it -- this rule
      *>             is satisfied by omission today, which is exactly why
      *>             nothing had ever contradicted it.
      *>   IXNEXT  - GR9: "The file position indicator is not affected by
      *>             the execution of a DELETE RECORD statement." After a
      *>             READ NEXT positions on K02 and K02 is deleted, the
      *>             next READ NEXT must return K03 -- the FPI survived
      *>             deletion of the record it was on.
      *>   IXIK23  - GR3 last sentence + GR11: a key the file does not
      *>             contain is the invalid key condition -> 23, the
      *>             INVALID KEY imperative RUNS and NOT INVALID KEY is
      *>             skipped (9.1.14).
      *>   IXNIK   - GR11 the other way: a successful delete takes the
      *>             NOT INVALID KEY branch.
      *>   IX43    - GR2: in SEQUENTIAL access the prior statement shall
      *>             have been a successful READ; with none, 43.
      *>   IX49    - GR1: the open mode shall be I-O; INPUT gives 49.
      *>
      *> NOTE: no INVALID KEY phrase appears on a sequential-access DELETE
      *> anywhere below -- 14.9.10.3 SR2 forbids it and COBOLNET1720 now
      *> enforces that under strict.
