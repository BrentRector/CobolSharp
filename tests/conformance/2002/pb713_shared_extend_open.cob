      *> kb/Work PB713 at the COBOL-2002 FLOOR — the shared OPEN EXTEND on
      *> every organization and framing that is legal in this edition.
      *>
      *> The full matrix is 2023/pb713_shared_extend_open; this is the
      *> subset that survives the edition floor, and the split is a fact
      *> about the constructs rather than a convenience. ORGANIZATION IS
      *> LINE SEQUENTIAL is COBOL-2023 (12.4.5.10.3 GR2; kb/Work PB688), so
      *> its four cases cannot appear here at all. What CAN, and does:
      *> record sequential FIXED width, record sequential RECORD VARYING —
      *> which is the framing whose whole-store probe carried the SAME
      *> defect as the reported line-sequential one — plus the RELATIVE and
      *> INDEXED organizations, and the two sharing spellings 14.9.27.3 SR8
      *> does not force a LOCK MODE clause onto.
      *>
      *> THE RULES. 14.9.27.4 GR1: "The execution of the OPEN statement
      *> causes the value of the I-O status associated with file-name-1 to
      *> be updated to one of the values in 9.1.13, I-O status"; GR25: "If
      *> the execution of the OPEN statement is unsuccessful, the file is
      *> not affected". A status is the only outcome the standard offers —
      *> the runtime used to measure the EXTEND write-ordinal base from a
      *> second host handle on the path it had just opened for WRITE, and
      *> the host's refusal escaped the run unit as an unhandled exception.
      *> 9.1.15 3) is what makes the shape legal: "The sharing with all
      *> other mode allows concurrent access to a physical file through
      *> other file connectors specifying input, I-O, or extend mode".
      *>
      *> WHAT THE APPEND HAS TO DO. 14.9.27.4 GR15: "When the EXTEND phrase
      *> is specified, the OPEN statement positions the file immediately
      *> after the last logical record for that file." 14.9.51.4 GR18: "If
      *> there are records in the physical file, the first record written
      *> after the execution of the OPEN statement with the EXTEND phrase
      *> is the successor of the last record in the physical file"; GR19
      *> fixes the measurement point for the shared case: "the added
      *> records follow the records present in the physical file when it
      *> was opened". Hence AAAA then BBBB, in that order, everywhere.
      *> 14.9.51.4 GR29 a) — the relative extend's first released record is
      *> "assigned a record number that is one greater than the highest
      *> relative record number existing in the physical file", so R-K is
      *> 0002 over a file holding RRN 1. GR38 — the indexed extend's first
      *> released record "shall have a prime record key whose value is
      *> greater than the highest prime record key value existing in the
      *> physical file when it was opened", so K006 follows K002.
