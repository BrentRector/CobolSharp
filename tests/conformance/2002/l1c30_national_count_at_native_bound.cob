      *> THE RULES:
      *>   SR14 c)4 (ALPHABET, NATIONAL phrase): "The number of
      *>   characters specified shall not exceed the number of
      *>   characters in the native national character set."
      *>   cite.py --check 12.3.7.3 "The number of characters
      *>     specified shall not exceed the number of characters in
      *>     the native national character set." -> OK §12.3.7.3 14)
      *>   SR17 c)5 (CLASS, NATIONAL phrase): "The number of
      *>   characters specified shall not exceed the number of
      *>   characters in the native national character set or, when
      *>   the IN phrase is specified, the number of characters in the
      *>   character set referenced by alphabet-name-4."
      *>   cite.py --check 12.3.7.3 "the number of characters in the
      *>     character set referenced by alphabet-name-4."
      *>     -> OK §12.3.7.3 17)
      *>   cite.py --check 12.3.7.4 "The characters specified by the
      *>     values of the literals in this clause define the
      *>     exclusive set of characters of which class-name-1
      *>     consists." -> OK §12.3.7.4 12)
      *>   cite.py --check 12.3.7.4 "may specify characters of the
      *>     native character set in either ascending or descending
      *>     sequence" -> OK §12.3.7.4 7) 2.  (cite.py mislabels list
      *>     items, PB1554: the text is GR7 k) 5.)
      *> "Shall not EXCEED" makes EQUAL legal. The native national set
      *> is the 65,536 UTF-16 code units, ordinal n = code unit n-1
      *> (docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-8, §12.3.7.4 GR6). Both clauses
      *> below name EXACTLY 65,536 characters - the bound - so the
      *> source is legal and must compile; a count check off by one
      *> would reject it. The over-bound side cannot be written
      *> without naming a character twice (SR14 a)) or an ordinal out
      *> of range (SR14 c)1 / SR17 c)2), so only the at-bound side of
      *> these rules is observable.
      *>   NREV = 65536 THRU 1: all 65,536 national characters in
      *>          reverse native order (GR7 k) 5. descending range):
      *>          SR14 c)4 at the bound.
      *>   NALL = CLASS ... 1 THRU 65536: SR17 c)5 native arm at the
      *>          bound. (The IN arm at the bound is held as a
      *>          suspected defect: an alphabet naming all 65,536
      *>          characters has no ordinals - see the lane report.)
