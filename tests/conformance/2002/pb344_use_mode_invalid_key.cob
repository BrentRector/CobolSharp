      *> kb/Work PB344 — the ISO edition the compilation targets reaches the file connectors and the
      *> generated USE-declarative selector.  Until PB344 no edition reached either, so the 2023 rules
      *> were served to --std 85, 2002 and 2014 as well.
      *>
      *> THE RULES, and every expected value below derived from them (no observation):
      *>  14.9.49.4 GR6 — the declarative runs on unsuccessful execution "unless an AT END or INVALID KEY
      *>    phrase takes precedence"; b)–e) scope it by OPEN MODE ("for any file open in the input mode or in
      *>    the process of being opened in the input mode", and its OUTPUT / I-O / EXTEND siblings).  (C1..C5)
      *>  14.9.49.4 GR5 — a declarative naming the FILE takes precedence over an open-mode one.        (C3)
      *>  14.9.30.4 GR28 — "If the file position indicator indicates that an optional input file is not
      *>    present, the invalid key condition exists ... (See 9.1.14, Invalid key condition.)"        (C4, C5)
      *>  9.1.13.5 item 3 b) — that condition's status is '23'.                                       (C4, C5)
      *>  14.9.27.4 GR13 — OPEN INPUT of an absent OPTIONAL file succeeds; 9.1.13.1 makes it '05'.     (C4, C5)
      *>  14.9.51.4 — a WRITE whose record key duplicates an existing one is the invalid key condition,
      *>    status '22' (9.1.13.5 item 2 b)).                                                    (C1, C2, C3)
      *>
      *> EDITIONS - C1..C5 ARE IDENTICAL AT 85, 2002, 2014 AND 2023, and that is the DETERMINATION this
      *> program pins (kb/Work PB344).  Annex E.2 item 19 a) reads "INVALID KEY processing.  If an INVALID KEY
      *> phrase is not specified and an invalid key condition occurs, any declarative that specified INPUT,
      *> OUTPUT, I-O, or EXTEND would not have been executed.  It will now be executed", which read as a
      *> behaviour change would make C1 and C4 edition-dependent.  It is not one.  Annex E is INFORMATIVE,
      *> E.1 scopes it to "a list of the substantive changes between the previous COBOL standard and this
      *> Working Draft International Standard" - ONE prior edition - and item 19's own justification says the
      *> previous standard "was not clear or missing processing of some I-O exceptions", the sub-item adding
      *> "This appears to be an error in previous COBOL standards".  A silence is not a prohibition, and its
      *> sibling item 19 b) is refuted outright for 1985 by that edition's validation suite (NIST CCVS
      *> SQ122A/SQ136A/SQ137A/SQ138A/SQ148A); nothing distinguishes the two halves' evidence.  GR6's
      *> open-mode tier is therefore edition-invariant - C3's file-name precedence (GR5) and C2/C5's written
      *> INVALID KEY phrase were already so - and all four copies expect the same lines.
      *> VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE row 25.
      *>
      *> A DECLARATIVE RUNS BEFORE THE STATEMENT'S OWN PHRASES AND BEFORE THE NEXT STATEMENT (GR6 — after the
      *> I-O status is set, 9.1.13.1), so each "DECL-" line precedes the status line of the case that raised it.
