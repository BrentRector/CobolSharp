      *> !! THE VALUE CLAUSE'S FORMAT-3 OPTIONAL WORDS, AND ITS TWO TRAILING BRACKETS IN PRINTED ORDER
      *> (kb/Work PB695 family 2 - the sibling sweep, invisible to the optional-word audit because a word
      *> REQUIRED INSIDE an optional group never reaches its candidate list).
      *> ISO 13.18.63.2 format 3, read off the printed page (PDF p546 / folio 516):
      *>     { VALUE IS | VALUES ARE } { literal-2 [ {THROUGH|THRU} literal-3 ] } ... [ IN alphabet-name-1 ]
      *>     [ WHEN SET TO FALSE IS literal-4 ]
      *> The only rules on that bracket sit under FALSE (x 228.02-255.10, 92% cover); WHEN, SET, TO and IS
      *> carry none, and the transcription's own figure note says the same. 8.3.2.4.3 therefore makes
      *> `88 CN VALUE 1 FALSE 0` the same clause as `88 CN VALUE 1 WHEN SET TO FALSE 0`.
      *> The SECOND defect the same measurement found: the printed format ends `... [ IN alphabet-name-1 ]`
      *> and puts `[ WHEN SET TO FALSE IS literal-4 ]` on the LINE AFTER it (format 5 likewise brackets IN
      *> before its {IS INVALID | ARE VALID} tail), and the grammar had the two the other way round - so
      *> `VALUE 1 IN AL1 WHEN SET TO FALSE 0`, the PRINTED spelling, was a COBOL0001 while an order no
      *> format prints was accepted. 5.2.6.2 makes bracket order part of the format.
      *> Expected values. 8.8.4.5.1 tests a conditional variable "to determine whether or not its value is
      *> equal to one of the values associated with condition-name-1", so with C1 = 1 both
      *> CN-BARE and CN-ORDER are true and CN-RANGE (2 THRU 3) is false; with C1 = 3 CN-RANGE is true and
      *> CN-BARE is false. Literal-4 is the value 13.18.63.4 GR20 places in the conditional variable for
      *> `SET condition-name TO FALSE`, which THIS processor documents as non-support - the FALSE phrase is
      *> accepted-inert, and only its SPELLING is under test here.
