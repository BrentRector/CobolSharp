      *> ISO §14.9.39.3 / §14.9.39.4 — SET format 5 with object-class-name-1 as the SENDER.
      *> The sender is a class NAME, not identifier-4, and §14.9.39.4 GR10 says what it sends:
      *> "If object-class-name-1 is specified, a reference to the factory object of the class
      *> identified by object-class-name-1 is placed into each data item referenced by
      *> identifier-3 in the order specified."  WHICH SYNTAX RULE THEN GOVERNS IS READ OFF THE
      *> RECEIVER: SR11 when identifier-3 is described with an interface-name, SR13 when it is
      *> described with an object-class-name.  kb/Work PB451 + PB496.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE RULES — NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>
      *> 1. SET IR TO PB451B — SR11: "If object-class-name-1 is specified and the data item
      *>    referenced by identifier-3 is described with an interface-name that identifies the
      *>    interface int-1, the factory object of object-class-name-1 shall be described with
      *>    an IMPLEMENTS clause that references int-1."  PB451B's FACTORY carries
      *>    IMPLEMENTS PB451I, so the assignment is legal, and GR10 puts PB451B's FACTORY
      *>    OBJECT — not an instance — into IR.  §9.3.6 gives a class two separate method
      *>    interfaces, so INVOKE IR "PING" resolves on the FACTORY roster:   PING-B
      *>    DISCRIMINATOR: resolving the INSTANCE roster would print IPING-B.
      *>
      *> 2. SET IR TO PB451D — the same rule over the INHERITED leg.  PB451D's FACTORY carries
      *>    NO IMPLEMENTS clause of its own; §11.4.4 GR2 c) makes its factory object implement
      *>    PB451I anyway ("the class containing the factory object inherits a class whose
      *>    factory object implements int-1"), which is the relation §11.4.4 GR1 says the
      *>    IMPLEMENTS clause names ("the interfaces that are implemented … according to
      *>    9.3.11").  PB451D's FACTORY overrides PING, so the line is:                PING-D
      *>    DISCRIMINATOR: reading SR11 as a literal claim about the clause TEXT would refuse
      *>    this program outright; copying the base's factory object would print PING-B.
      *>
      *> 3. SET FO TO PB451B — SR13's leading requirement, "the data item shall be described
      *>    with the FACTORY phrase" (FO is), and SR13 a): "if the data item referenced by
      *>    identifier-3 is described with the ONLY phrase, object-class-name-1 shall be the
      *>    object-class-name specified in the description of the data item referenced by
      *>    identifier-3."  FO is described FACTORY OF PB451B ONLY and the sender names
      *>    PB451B exactly, so it holds what §13.18.60.4 GR22 d)2.a. allows an ONLY factory
      *>    reference to hold — "the factory object of the specified class", that class and no
      *>    subclass.  INVOKE FO "TAG" is therefore:                                  FTAG-B
      *>    DISCRIMINATOR: the same receiver with PB451D as the sender is refused — fixture
      *>    conformance:negative/pb451-classname-sender-only-receiver-subclass.
      *>
      *> 4. SET F1 F2 TO PB451D — GR10's multi-receiver form, "placed into EACH data item
      *>    referenced by identifier-3 in the order specified", over receivers described
      *>    FACTORY OF PB451B WITHOUT the ONLY phrase, which §13.18.60.4 GR22 d)1.a. lets hold
      *>    "the factory object of the specified class OR OF A SUBCLASS".  SR13 b) permits the
      *>    subclass name.  Both receivers answer TAG with PB451D's override:
      *>                                                                       FTAG-D  FTAG-D
      *>    DISCRIMINATOR: placing the reference into only the first receiver leaves F2 null
      *>    and raises EC-OO-NULL; ignoring the subclass would print FTAG-B twice.
