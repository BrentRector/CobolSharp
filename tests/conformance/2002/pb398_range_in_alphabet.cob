      *> clauses the phrase is printed in - EVALUATE's selection object and the VALUE clause's condition-name
      *> list (13.18.63.2 formats 3 and 5) - because 14.7.8 opens by governing them in one sentence: "This
      *> specification applies to THROUGH phrases specified in the VALUE clause and the EVALUATE statement."
      *> 14.7.8 rule 2: with no phrase "the collating sequence is defined by the implementor" (this compiler's
      *> default is the PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE); "when the IN alphabet-name phrase is specified, the
      *> collating sequence used for range evaluation is the collating sequence defined by that alphabet".
      *> kb/Work PB398: the EVALUATE phrase had NO GRAMMAR (a raw parse error) and the VALUE clause's twin was
      *> PARSED AND DROPPED - a silent wrong answer.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES. Under ALPHABET AL IS "ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA" the literal phrase assigns
      *> ascending positions in written order (12.3.7.4 GR7 k), so position(Z)=0 ... position(A)=25; hence
      *> position(M)=13 and position(C)=23. WS-C holds "C". AL is also the PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE, which is
      *> what makes each line a DISCRIMINATOR rather than a coincidence:
      *>   A  `"M" THRU "A" IN AL`   -> 13 <= 23 <= 25                      -> true   -> IN
      *>   B  `"A" THRU "M" IN NAT-A` - NAT-A IS STANDARD-1, whose sequence is the native one (12.3.7.4 GR7 c),
      *>      so rule 2 puts this range under NATIVE order even though the PCS is AL:
      *>      'A'(x41) <= 'C'(x43) <= 'M'(x4D)                              -> true   -> IN
      *>   C  `"A" THRU "M"` with NO phrase -> rule 2's implementor arm = the PCS = AL, where "A"(25) collates
      *>      AFTER "M"(13): the range is inverted and 14.7.8 makes it EMPTY -> false  -> OUT
      *>   D  the VALUE-clause twin, `88 ... VALUE "M" THRU "A" IN AL`      -> true   -> IN
      *>   E  the same set with no phrase, `VALUE "A" THRU "M"`             -> false  -> OUT
      *>   F  a SINGLETON value in a clause that also names an alphabet is NOT governed by it - 14.7.8 is the
      *>      THROUGH phrase's specification and rule 2 names the sequence "used for RANGE evaluation", while a
      *>      singleton is compared by 8.8.4.5.3 GR2's ordinary relation rules (under the PCS). WS-C = "C" is
