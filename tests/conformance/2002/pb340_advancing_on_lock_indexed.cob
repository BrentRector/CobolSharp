      *> !! THE INDEXED TWIN OF pb340_advancing_on_lock_relative (kb/Work PB340).
      *> ISO 14.9.30.4 GR22 is a FORMAT-1 rule - ADVANCING ON LOCK appears only
      *> in the Format-1 general format (14.9.30.2) and 14.9.30.3 SR6 bars it
      *> under ACCESS MODE RANDOM - so it reaches every organization that can be
      *> read sequentially. The skip-scan lived only inside the sequential-
      *> ORGANIZATION arm of the governed read, so an indexed READ NEXT
      *> ADVANCING ON LOCK answered '51', the one status GR22 rules out: "A
      *> record operation conflict condition does not exist."
      *> Only rule d) of GR21's indexed selection is relied on here - "If the
      *> previous operation on the file was a successful OPEN or START statement"
      *> - so each PREVIOUS read below is re-anchored by its own START.
