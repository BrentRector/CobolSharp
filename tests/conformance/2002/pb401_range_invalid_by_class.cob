      *> EC-RANGE-INVALID IS KEYED ON A THROUGH RANGE'S CLASS, NOT ON ITS OPERANDS' WRITTEN FORM.
      *> ISO 14.7.8 THROUGH phrase opens "This specification applies to THROUGH phrases specified in the VALUE
      *> clause and the EVALUATE statement" and then splits in two: rule 1 - "When the range of values is defined
      *> by numeric literals, the range of values includes literal-1, literal-2, and all algebraic values between
      *> literal-1 and literal-2" (algebraic, no sequence, NO exception); rule 2 - "When the range of values is
      *> defined by alphanumeric or national literals, the range of values depends on the collating sequence used
      *> for evaluation of the range", which owns the sequence AND the exception: "When the value of literal-1 is
      *> greater than the value of literal-2 in the collating sequence in effect at runtime, the EC-RANGE-INVALID
      *> exception condition is set to exist, and, upon completion of any exception processing, execution proceeds
      *> as if the range of values were empty."  14.9.13.4 GR2 delegates EVALUATE's THROUGH phrase to that clause.
      *> Rule 2's "literals" is NOT an operand-form restriction: 14.7.8 introduces the phrase as "a range of
      *> values, literal-1 through literal-2" while EVALUATE's range-expression (14.9.13.2) has no literal-1 or
      *> literal-2 at all, and 14.9.13.3 SR3 - a rule about this very phrase - says "the literals or identifiers
      *> specified in the THROUGH phrase are of class alphabetic, alphanumeric, or national".
      *> Witness for kb/Work PB401. >>TURN and FUNCTION EXCEPTION-STATUS are COBOL-2002 (ISO 7.3.25, 15.22), which
      *> is why this case is filed at 2002; the range forms themselves are EVALUATE's own since 1985.
      *> ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: FUNCTION EXCEPTION-STATUS is STICKY, so every arm that must set NOTHING is written
      *> BEFORE the first arm that sets the exception. Reversing them is how the original probe reported a false
      *> positive from the literal arm's own carry-over.
