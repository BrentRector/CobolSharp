      *> ISO 12.3.7.2 — the SPECIAL-NAMES LOCALE clause, `LOCALE locale-name-1 IS {external-locale-name-1 | literal-4}`,
      *> and the NAMED form of the ALPHABET LOCALE phrase, `ALPHABET a IS LOCALE locale-name-2` (12.3.7.3 SR24) —
      *> increment T1 of docs/rearchitecture/DESIGN-locale-facility.md (kb/Work PB64; Annex A.4.9 item 10, the clause half).
      *>
      *> What each line proves:
      *>   ROOT   — the program collating sequence (CUR — IS LOCALE without a name, 12.3.7.4 GR7e) under the
      *>            harness's pinned user default (the root / INVARIANT order): n-tilde is n + tilde at the
      *>            secondary level, so "nz" > "nu-tilde" (z > u at level 1 decides).
      *>   ES1/2/3 — DETERMINATION L1: the external identification is NORMALIZED before lookup — the literal branch
      *>            "es_ES.UTF-8" (the .codeset suffix ignored), the external-locale-name word es_ES (a legal word,
      *>            8.3.2.1 admits the underscore), and the BCP-47 literal "es-ES" all identify ONE locale
      *>            (8.5.3.1 rule 2's "same external identification"): under each, SET LOCALE LC_COLLATE makes
      *>            n-tilde a PRIMARY after n (CLDR es: &N<ñ<<<Ñ), so "nz" < "nu-tilde".
      *>   NAMED  — an alphabet bound to a NAMED locale (SWE IS LOCALE SV) collates by THAT locale whatever the
      *>            current locale is: the SORT below names SWE in its COLLATING SEQUENCE while LC_COLLATE is
      *>            Spanish, and the Swedish order puts o-umlaut AFTER z (CLDR sv: &[before 1]ǀ<…<ö) — a
      *>            root/Spanish order would put "öre" before "zebra" (o + umlaut).
      *>   BACK   — SET LOCALE LC_COLLATE TO USER-DEFAULT restores the root order (14.9.39.4 GR23b).
      *> Non-ASCII appears only inside literals (UTF-8 source); every DISPLAY is ASCII.
