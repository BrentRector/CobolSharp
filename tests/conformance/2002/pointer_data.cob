      *> ISO §13.18.60.4 / §8.4.3.10 / §14.9.39 — COBOL-2002 POINTER data (Phase 1).
      *> A USAGE POINTER item is an 8-byte opaque machine-address handle. NULL is the predefined null
      *> address (the all-zero handle). Phase 1 covers: declaration, SET p TO NULL, SET p TO another
      *> pointer, and equality comparison (= / NOT =) against NULL and against another pointer.
      *> (ADDRESS OF / BASED / ALLOCATE — taking a real address — are deferred to Phase 2; until then every
      *> pointer can only hold NULL, so the comparisons below are all against the null handle.)
