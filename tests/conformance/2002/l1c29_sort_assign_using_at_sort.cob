      *> GR4 (content meaning) is the documented choice DOC-A.1-73 in
      *> docs/CONFORMANCE.md: the content with spaces removed is the target,
      *> and a target containing "." is used verbatim.
      *> Edition: ASSIGN USING (dynamic file assignment, §9.1.21) is placed
      *> at 2002 per the adjudicated row; ISO_COBOL.md itself does not date
      *> it (the project also accepts it at 85, pb324_assign_using_85).
      *> Setup: both connectors are last OPENed on a DIFFERENT file than
      *> the one named at the SORT: FI last opened l1c29b-1.dat (Z1,Y1),
      *> FO last opened l1c29b-q.dat (QQ). Before the SORT the names are
      *> set to l1c29b-2.dat (B2,A2) and l1c29b-o.dat (holding STALE).
      *> Derivation:
      *>  GR3 b): the SORT reads l1c29b-2.dat and writes l1c29b-o.dat, so
      *>  l1c29b-o.dat holds B2,A2 sorted ascending on the first byte:
      *>  "OUT-O A2", "OUT-O B2" (STALE is replaced: the implicit OPEN
      *>  OUTPUT of GIVING recreates the file). l1c29b-q.dat is untouched:
      *>  "OUT-Q QQ". An implementation associating at the last OPEN would
      *>  print Y1/Z1 and/or a changed Q file.
