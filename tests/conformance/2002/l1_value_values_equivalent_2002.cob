      *> ISO §13.18.63.3 SR17 — "The words VALUE and VALUES are
      *> equivalent." — THE GATE-BOUNDARY COPY, compiled at --std 2002.
      *>
      *> The rule is printed in the FORMAT 2 (table) block and SR24
      *> ("Syntax rules 10 and 17 above apply") imports it into
      *> FORMAT 3. Format 2 is a COBOL-2002 introduction, so 2002 is
      *> the EARLIEST edition this row claims: this copy is what goes
      *> red if the Format-2 gate ever drifts upward to 2014/2023, and
      *> the 2023 copy (l1_value_values_equivalent) is what goes red if
      *> the equivalence itself drifts at the default edition. The two
      *> assert the same four lines because the words are ONE token
      *> position with no version predicate on either side.
      *>
      *> DERIVED EXPECTATIONS — from the rule text, not from a run:
      *>  T1 §13.18.63.4 GR12 initializes the element named by
      *>     subscript-1 (= 1) to "AB"; GR13 reuses the literal until
      *>     the element named by subscript-2 (= 3) is initialized, so
      *>     all three elements hold "AB"  =>  "ABABAB".
      *>  T2 Two literals over four elements: GR12 gives element 1
      *>     "A" and element 2 "B"; GR13 reuses the list in order
      *>     through element 4  =>  "ABAB".
      *>  C-IN / C-OUT §8.8.4.5.3 GR3 — the test is true if one of the
      *>     values of the condition-name equals its conditional
      *>     variable. CV = 3 is one of {1,2,3} => T; 7 is not => F.
      *>
      *> §5.2.3 (Optional words) makes IS and ARE optional, so G-C vs
      *> G-D differ in EXACTLY the one word the rule is about.
