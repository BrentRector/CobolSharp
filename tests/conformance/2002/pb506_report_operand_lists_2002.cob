      *> THE EARLIEST EDITION AT WHICH THE OPERAND LIST CAN EXIST (kb/Work PB506).
      *> ISO §13.18.63.3 SR35 (VALUE) and §13.18.53.3 SR6 (SOURCE) carry no version proviso, and Annex E lists no
      *> 2014→2023 change to either; what IS edition-bound is the REPETITION VEHICLE they require — §13.15.4 GR3's
      *> "a LINE or COLUMN clause with more than one operand" — and the multiple COLUMN clause, the COLUMNS/ARE
      *> spellings and the SOURCES spelling are all COBOL-2002 introductions (COBOLNET0900 below 2002; the
      *> version-matrix rows report-multi-column-2002 and report-multi-source-2002 pin those gates).  So COBOL-2002
      *> is the oldest edition at which a conforming multi-operand VALUE or SOURCE clause can be WRITTEN at all,
      *> and this program is the proof that it compiles and runs there — the same source as the 2023 twin's
      *> report section, with the two lists and all five VALUE-initialization shapes.
      *>
      *> WHY THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT READ THE REPORT FILE BACK, and the 2023 twin does.  The read-back needs
      *> ORGANIZATION IS LINE SEQUENTIAL, which is itself a COBOL-2023 introduction (§12.4.5.10.3 GR2 — the
      *> Foreword lists it among the main changes over ISO/IEC 1989:2014), so it cannot appear in a COBOL-2002
      *> program at all (the kb/Work PB688 precedent, which removed exactly this read-back from an 85 fixture).
      *> The CONTENT assertions therefore live in tests/conformance/2023/pb506_report_value_operand_list, and what
      *> this program asserts at 2002 is that the whole construct is ACCEPTED and the report presents: the
      *> emitter's operand-cycling and VALUE-recipe paths carry no version predicate, so a divergence between the
      *> editions could only come from a gate, and a gate would show up here as a COBOLNET0900 rejection.
      *>
      *> DERIVATION OF THE EXPECTED OUTPUT.  One INITIATE, two GENERATEs of the same TYPE DE group, one TERMINATE;
      *> nothing is control-broken and nothing is suppressed, so the program simply reaches its final DISPLAY.
      *> Expected: GEN-1, GEN-2, DONE.
