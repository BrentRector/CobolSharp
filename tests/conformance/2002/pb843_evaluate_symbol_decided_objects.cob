      *> kb/Work PB843 - two EVALUATE selection-object shapes the GRAMMAR cannot decide, decided by the
      *> RESOLVED SYMBOL. ISO 8.3.2.2: "Within a source element, a given user-defined word may be used as only
      *> one type of user-defined word" - so an alphabet-name or class-name is never a data-name, and only the
      *> symbol table says which one a word is.
      *>
      *> (1) 14.9.13.2's range-expression ends `[ IN alphabet-name-1 ]`, and 14.9.13.3 SR3 admits it over
      *>     identifiers: "Alphabet-name-1 may be specified only when the literals or identifiers specified in
      *>     the THROUGH phrase are of class alphabetic, alphanumeric, or national". IN is also the
      *>     qualification connective, so `WS-HI IN AL` parses as a qualified reference; it was COBOLNET1639.
      *> (2) 14.9.13.3 SR5: "A selection object is a partial-expression if the leftmost portion of the
      *>     selection object is a relational operator, a class condition without the identifier, ...".
      *>     A BARE class-name / alphabet-name is that class condition; it bound as identifier-2 (COBOLNET1639
      *>     "not defined"), and LEADING a combined object it bound as a stand-alone condition.
      *>     SR8: the object "is treated as though it were specified as condition-2, where condition-2 is the
      *>     conditional expression that results from preceding partial-expression-1 by the selection subject".
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES. ALPHABET AL IS "ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA": a literal phrase assigns ascending
      *> positions in written order (12.3.7.4 GR7 k), so pos(M)=13, pos(C)=23, pos(A)=25. No PROGRAM
      *> COLLATING SEQUENCE is declared, so with no phrase 14.7.8 rule 2's implementor arm is the NATIVE order.
      *> WS-C = "C".
      *>   A  `WS-LO THRU WS-HI IN AL`, WS-LO = "M", WS-HI = "A": 13 <= 23 <= 25            -> A-IN
      *>      (with no phrase, native "M" > "A" is an inverted range, empty by 14.7.8 rule 2 -> A-OUT)
      *>   B  `"A" THRU WS-H2 IN GRP2` - GRP2 is a GROUP, so IN GRP2 stays a qualifier: WS-H2 OF GRP2 = "D",
      *>      native "A" <= "C" <= "D"                                                       -> B-IN
      *>   C  `"M" THRU WS-H2 IN GRP1 IN AL` - the first IN qualifies, the LAST names the alphabet:
      *>      WS-H2 OF GRP1 = "A", 13 <= 23 <= 25 under AL                                   -> C-IN
