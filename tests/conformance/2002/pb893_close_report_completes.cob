       >>TURN EC-REPORT-NOT-TERMINATED CHECKING ON
      *> kb/Work PB893 - ISO 14.9.6.4 GR5: "If any report is in the
      *> active state, the CLOSE statement for that file is completed
      *> and the EC-REPORT-NOT-TERMINATED exception condition is set to
      *> exist." GR4 updates the I-O status; GR10 makes CLOSE RPT OTH
      *> two implicit CLOSE statements, and a RESUME NEXT STATEMENT
      *> "resumes at the next implicit CLOSE statement, if any".
      *> 1st CLOSE: RPT is closed (status 00) BEFORE the declarative
      *>   runs; RESUME AT P2 (14.9.33.4 GR3, as if GO TO P2) skips the
      *>   implicit CLOSE OTH, so OTH stays open - but RPT is closed,
      *>   and re-opening it succeeds (00). Before the fix the raise
      *>   preceded the close, the transfer abandoned it, and the
      *>   re-OPEN answered 41 (already open).
      *> 2nd CLOSE: the declarative sees RPT's updated status 00 and
      *>   RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT runs the next implicit CLOSE (OTH).
