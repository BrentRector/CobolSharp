      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 13.18.63.3 SR25 (kb/Work PB551) forbids a format 3, 4 or 5 VALUE clause in or under a
      *> CONSTANT RECORD entry - and ONLY those formats. The FORMAT-1 VALUEs of the record's own entries are its
      *> content (13.18.15.4), and a condition-name on an item OUTSIDE the constant record is untouched.
      *> WHY EACH LINE CAN FAIL:
      *>   CR=      the record's format-1 content, [7AB]; a screen barring every VALUE under the record refuses it.
      *>   FLAG=    Y - the level-88 on W (not in the constant record) still binds and evaluates.
