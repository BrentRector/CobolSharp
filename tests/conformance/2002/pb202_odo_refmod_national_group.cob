      *> kb/Work PB202 - the NATIONAL-channel twin of 85/pb202_odo_refmod_group_direction. A national group
      *> reference-modified is operated on in national positions (8.4.3.3.4 GR5a), and ISO 1989:2023 13.18.38.4
      *> GR8b applies unchanged: as a SENDING operand a depending-inside group uses only its current extent, as a
      *> RECEIVING operand "the maximum length of the group will be used".
      *>   R1 = cddd   N(4:) at count 2: 1 + 2 x 3 = 7 national positions, from position 4 to the end.
      *> RECEIVING N(2:9) at count 2 writes positions 2-10 of the 16-position maximum; 11-16 (fff ggg) are outside
      *> the unique data item and unmodified:

      *> Before the fix R2 lost positions 11-16 (the splice base was read at the current extent and the
      *> maximum-length store wrote the short image back over the whole group).
