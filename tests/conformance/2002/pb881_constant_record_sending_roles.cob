      *> kb/Work PB881 — the POSITIVE half of ISO 13.18.15.3 SR2: the rule bars a CONSTANT RECORD only as a
      *> RECEIVING data item, so every SENDING use stays legal. The fix routes each verb's operand by its ROLE,
      *> and this program pins the roles that must NOT be refused:
      *>   * INSPECT TALLYING alone — 14.9.22.3 SR8: "Identifier-1 is a sending operand." (Format 1)
      *>     "aabaa" holds four "a" (14.9.22.4 GR12 a), and the constant is unchanged.
      *>   * MOVE CORRESPONDING with the constant as identifier-1 (the SENDING group): F1 OF S gets "old".
