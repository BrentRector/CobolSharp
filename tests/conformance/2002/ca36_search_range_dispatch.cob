      >>TURN EC-RANGE CHECKING ON
      *> CA36 (CONFORMANCE-FIX-QUEUE): with EC-RANGE checking ON, a SEARCH that ends unsuccessfully and has NO AT END
      *> phrase must transfer to an applicable exception-processing statement (ISO 14.9.37.4 GR1b2) — here the USE
      *> AFTER EXCEPTION CONDITION EC-RANGE-SEARCH-NO-MATCH declarative. No element equals 9, so the scan advances
      *> past occurrence 3 (GR6) and EC-RANGE-SEARCH-NO-MATCH is set; AT END is absent -> the declarative runs
      *> ("DECL-RAN"); it is Nonfatal (Table 13) and returns normally, so control transfers to the end of the SEARCH
      *> and execution continues ("AFTER-SEARCH"). Pre-fix the SEARCH set the EC status but never DISPATCHED it, so
      *> the declarative was skipped and only "AFTER-SEARCH" printed.
