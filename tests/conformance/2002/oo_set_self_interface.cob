      *> ISO §14.9.39.3 SR10d2: SET … TO SELF into a receiver described with an interface-name is legal
      *> exactly when the INSTANCE definition containing the SET "is described with an IMPLEMENTS clause that
      *> references int-1". CSELFY's OBJECT does IMPLEMENT ISELFY, so the SET conforms and SELF widens to the
      *> interface view. The positive control for the SR10d2 rejection in
      *> negative/oo-set-self-interface-not-implemented — the two differ only by the IMPLEMENTS clause, which
      *> is what makes this pair a test of the RULE rather than of the program.
      *> The interface view is then INVOKEd back through, so the widening is proved to reach a working
      *> receiver rather than merely to bind: expected output is PONG.
