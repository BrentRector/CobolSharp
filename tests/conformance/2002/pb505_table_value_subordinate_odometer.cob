      *> kb/Work PB505 at the FORMAT 2 (table) VALUE's INTRODUCTION EDITION (COBOL-2002, 13.18.63.2).
      *> 13.18.63.3 SR18/SR20/SR21 and 13.18.63.4 GR12-GR15 carry no version proviso, so the subordinate
      *> arm and the multi-dimension odometer behave here exactly as they do at 2023.  The dynamic-capacity
      *> legs of the 2023 golden are deliberately absent: OCCURS DYNAMIC is a 2014 construct.
      *> EXPECTED, derived from the spec (see tests/conformance/2023/pb505_table_value_geometry.cob for the
      *> quoted rules):
      *>   1[AB|CD|AB]  SR18's subordinate arm + GR14's implied TO (3) + GR13's cyclic reuse
      *>   2[123|456]   GR12's odometer over a 2x3 table
      *>   3[AB/CD|AB/CD]  a GROUP entry's table VALUE, GR5's area deposit per occurrence
