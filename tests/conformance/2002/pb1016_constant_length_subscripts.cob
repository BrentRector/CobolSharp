      *> kb/Work PB1016 - CONSTANT AS LENGTH OF data-name-2 WITH SUBSCRIPTS (ISO 13.10, 2002).
      *> 13.10.3 SR3: "All subscripts of data-name-1 and data-name-2 shall be literals." - so a subscript may
      *> be written on data-name-2, and 8.4.2.3.3 decides WHERE and HOW MANY: SR2 (only on an item that has, or
      *> is subordinate to, an OCCURS clause) and SR3 (one subscript per OCCURS clause). Every subscript below is
      *> legal - the count equals the OCCURS depth - including the one hung off a QUALIFICATION
      *> (CELL OF ROWX (3 2)), which the constant binder used to neither check nor count.
      *> 13.10.4 GR6: the value is that of the LENGTH function over data-name-2 - a subscript never changes it,
      *> since every occurrence shares one description:
      *>   K1 = 4    CELL is PIC X(4)
      *>   K2 = 8    ROWX holds CELL OCCURS 2: 2 x 4
      *>   K3 = 4    CELL again, qualified, subscripts written after the qualifier
      *>   K4 = 24   T holds ROWX OCCURS 3: 3 x 8 (an unsubscripted non-table group)
      *> The negative halves: negative/pb1016-constant-length-subscript-on-non-table (SR2) and
      *> negative/pb1016-constant-length-subscript-count (SR3).
