      *>             located, PP is its address, CALL PP runs it.
      *>   NESTED    a direct CALL "L1C23N" from the containing program reaches the contained program,
      *>             so the name is real and in scope here.
      *>   N-NULL    L1C23N is CONTAINED, not outermost; GR2 takes only an outermost program, so no
      *>             program is located and GR4 makes the value NULL.
      *>   EXT-P     "L1C23X" is the externalized name (AS phrase) of outermost L1C23P: located.
      *>   P-NULL    "L1C23P" is the SOURCE word of that program, not its externalized name; no outermost
      *>             program is externalized as L1C23P, so GR4 gives NULL.
