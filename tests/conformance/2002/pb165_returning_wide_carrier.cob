      *> result of the activated program is placed into identifier-3." The delivery has to be TOTAL over the
      *> carriers this compiler emits. Measured before PB165: the character-shaped delivery leg stored only
      *> into a string carrier or, via long.TryParse, a long one - so a result reaching a PIC 9(30)
      *> identifier-3 (an Int128/UInt128 carrier, i.e. EVERY receiver past 18 digits) was DISCARDED with no
      *> store and no diagnostic; R kept its previous value 7. Here the pair is a DYNAMIC (Format 1) CALL,
      *> where no bind-time 14.8.3 screen exists, and the callee's returning item is category alphanumeric
      *> while identifier-3 is category numeric - a pair 14.8.3.3 declares non-conforming, which 14.9.4.4 GR3d
      *> makes EC-PROGRAM-ARG-MISMATCH when checking is enabled in both elements. It is NOT enabled here, so
      *> the call proceeds; what GR4 forbids is the result not arriving at all. The digit image "000123" is
      *> what the receiver would have seen had the pair conformed by length, and that is what it receives.
      *> W pins the same GR4 sentence on the CONFORMING wide pair, so the golden fails if the total delivery
      *> were "fixed" by breaking the identical-description case. P pins GR4 over a USAGE POINTER returning
      *> item - the carrier whose missing StoreReturn leg was a raw Roslyn CS1503 on conforming source before
      *> kb/Work PB133 wave B, and which the totality rule now keeps loud rather than lost if it regresses.
