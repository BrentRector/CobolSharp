      *> ⛔ ISO 13.18.53.3 SR7 — THE PARENTHESIZED OPERAND LIST (kb/Work PB852).  "If the SOURCE clause has more
      *> than one operand of which at least one is an arithmetic-expression, each operand shall be enclosed in
      *> parentheses."  Operands of a SOURCE clause are separated by nothing but a space (13.18.53.2's ellipsis
      *> repeats the brace pair), so once an operand may itself contain operators the list has two readings and
      *> the standard removes the choice by requiring the parentheses — on EVERY operand, the bare identifiers
      *> included.  The rule is ENFORCED (COBOLNET2142), never inferred from the grammar's shape; its negative
      *> twin is tests/conformance/negative/pb852-source-operand-parens.cob.
      *>
      *> WHY THIS COPY IS AT 2002 AND THE REST OF PB852 AT 85.  SR7 only bites on a multi-operand clause, which
      *> SR6 confines to a repeating entry ("the entry shall be a repeating entry or shall be subordinate to a
      *> repeating entry"), and 13.15.4 GR3's repetition vehicles — a multiple COLUMN or LINE clause, or a
      *> report-group OCCURS — are COBOL-2002 introductions.  The ROUNDED phrase and the expression operand
      *> themselves are witnessed at 85 by tests/conformance/85/pb852_report_source_expression.cob.
      *>
      *> DERIVATION OF THE EXPECTED OUTPUT.  WS-A = 100, WS-B = 23, WS-N = 2.  One TYPE DE group, one GENERATE.
      *> The entry writes COLUMNS ARE 1 5 — two repetitions (13.15.4 GR3) — and two SOURCE operands, so
      *> 13.18.53.4 GR4 assigns "successive operands to successive repeating printable items, horizontally and
      *> then vertically": operand 1 to COLUMN 1, operand 2 to COLUMN 5.
      *>   (WS-A)            => 100
      *>   (WS-B * WS-N)     => 23 × 2 = 46, into PIC 9(3) => 046
