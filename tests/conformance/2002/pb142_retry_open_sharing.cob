      *> kb/Work PB142 - the OPEN arm of the RETRY conflict-status class
      *> rule. ISO 14.9.27.4 GR24 routes an OPEN sharing conflict's status
      *> through 14.7.9, whose GR4a and closing paragraph both land "the
      *> appropriate value ... according to the rules for 9.1.13".
      *> 9.1.13.9 item 1 defines that value as '61' and defines NO deadlock
      *> value for a file sharing conflict, so EVERY retry form answers 61.
      *> The compiler used to manufacture '52' (9.1.13.8's RECORD-conflict
      *> deadlock) on the SECONDS/FOREVER arm; nothing in the suite wrote
      *> OPEN with a RETRY phrase, so that arm was silently wrong.
      *>
      *> The OPN35* legs guard the rule's OTHER edge: a status that is not
      *> a conflict at all. 14.7.9.3 GR4 opens "if the I/O operation is
      *> unsuccessful on the first attempt because of a file sharing
      *> conflict condition or a record operation conflict condition", so
      *> an absent file's 35 is the statement's own answer and RETRY must
      *> not touch it. It used to answer 52 as well.
      *>
      *> The DELIBERATE asymmetry -- a RECORD operation conflict under
      *> FOREVER KEEPS 52, because 9.1.13.8 item 2 is a record-conflict
      *> value whose detection conditions the implementor defines (A.1
      *> item 109), where 9.1.13.9 defines none -- is pinned end-to-end by
      *> file_sharing_seq (READD5=52) and file_sharing_mutate (REWQFV=52),
      *> and cell by cell by the unit drift test
      *> CobolFileLockTests.RetryLoop_LandsTheConflictsOwnStatus_ByClass.
      *> Those must STAY GREEN: this fix is class-scoped, not a blanket
      *> removal of 52.
