      *> kb/Work PB873 - the GR9/GR10 COMPUTE arm of the same crossing: a
      *> NESTED activation, whose formal description the activating
      *> element knows, into an IMAGE-CARRIED (redefined) numeric formal.
      *> ISO 14.2.3 GR10: "The allocated record is a data item of the same
      *> description as the formal parameter" and the argument is its
      *> sending operand in "a COMPUTE statement without the ROUNDED
      *> phrase"; GR9's NESTED branch performs the same COMPUTE for BY
      *> CONTENT. The record's description is S9(4)V99 - SIGNED - so the
      *> image the callee sees carries the operational sign.
      *> Sign characters: the IBM trailing over-punch (DOC-A.1-177):
      *> -4 = "M", -0 = "}".
      *> Derived:
      *>   BY VALUE SM (-12.34)       -> 00123M, negative
      *>   BY VALUE -7                -> -7.00  = 00070}, negative
      *>   BY VALUE SX (-123.4)       -> -123.40 = 01234}, negative
      *>   BY CONTENT -45.5           -> -45.50 = 00455}, negative
      *>   BY CONTENT SM              -> 00123M; the callee's SUBTRACT
      *>     reaches only the allocated record, so SM stays -12.34.
