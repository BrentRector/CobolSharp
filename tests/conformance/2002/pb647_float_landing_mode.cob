      *> kb/Work PB647 at COBOL-2002 — ONE returned value, ONE rounding decision, taken at the RESULTANT
      *> IDENTIFIER. The 2014/2023 twins add the eight-mode ROUNDED MODE IS phrase and the OPTIONS
      *> DEFAULT ROUNDED MODE clause, neither of which exists at this edition; what IS testable here is the
      *> whole substance of the defect, because it needed no MODE phrase to reach a program: the
      *> float-intrinsic quantizer rounded NEAREST-AWAY-FROM-ZERO at a working scale regardless, so
      *> `MOVE FUNCTION SQRT(3) TO R9` gave 1.732050807 and `COMPUTE R9 = FUNCTION SQRT(3)` gave
      *> 1.732050808 into ONE PIC 9V9(9), which ISO 15.4.1 forbids -- "the returned value is the same for
      *> all instances of a given function within a single execution of the runtime element so long as the
      *> value and order of the arguments, the collating sequence, and the locale are unchanged".
      *>
      *> 14.6.8.2 rule 4 gives the MOVE its landing: "If the receiving operand is a fixed-point numeric item,
      *> the data is aligned by decimal point and is transferred to the receiving digits with zero fill or
      *> truncation on either end as required."  14.7.4.1 gives the arithmetic store the same shape: "If,
      *> after decimal point alignment, the number of places in the fractional part of the result of an
      *> arithmetic operation is greater than the number of places provided for the fraction of the resultant
      *> identifier, truncation is relative to the size provided for the resultant identifier."  14.7.4.3
      *> rule 2 -- "If the ROUNDED phrase is not specified, execution is as if ROUNDED MODE IS TRUNCATION had
      *> been specified" -- and rule 4 makes a bare ROUNDED the nearest value, ties farther from zero.
