      *> CA24 (CONFORMANCE-FIX-QUEUE): EXP/EXP10's only argument rule is "class numeric" (ISO 15.34.3 r1) — no upper
      *> bound — so EXP(710) is a LEGAL argument whose value e**710 ~ 2.25e308 merely overflows; it saturates and
      *> undergoes ordinary receiver SIZE handling (15.34.4 / 14.7.4), it is NOT a domain error. Pre-fix, +Inf was
      *> mapped to EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION's default 0, so NOT ON SIZE ERROR wrongly fired and R became 0.
