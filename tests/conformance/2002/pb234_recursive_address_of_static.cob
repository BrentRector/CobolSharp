      *> kb/Work PB234 - ADDRESS OF a static WORKING-STORAGE item of a
      *> RECURSIVE program. Before PB234 the program was refused outright
      *> (COBOLNET0899); nothing in 8.4.3.11 or 14.9.5.4 forbids it.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED FROM THE RULES:
      *>  - 13.5.4 GR1: the working-storage of a program without the initial
      *>    attribute is STATIC data - one copy shared by every activation.
      *>    The first CALL writes "WXYZ" through a BASED view of ADDRESS OF W
      *>    (8.4.3.11.4 GR1 / 14.9.39.4 GR13), so the direct DISPLAY sees
      *>    W=WXYZ, and the nested (recursive) activation's own ADDRESS OF W
      *>    names the SAME copy: INNER=WXYZ, and the two data-pointers are
      *>    equal (8.8.4.2): SAME.
      *>  - The second CALL without CANCEL finds the last-used state
      *>    (14.6.2.3.3): ENTRY=WXYZ D=2.
      *>  - 14.9.5.4 GR3: after CANCEL the next CALL finds the INITIAL state -
      *>    14.6.2.3.2 action 2 re-seeds W from its VALUE: ENTRY=ABCD D=1.
