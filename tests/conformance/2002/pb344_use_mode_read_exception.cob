      *> kb/Work PB344 — the ISO edition the compilation targets reaches the file connectors and the
      *> generated USE-declarative selector.  Until PB344 no edition reached either, so the 2023 rules
      *> were served to --std 85, 2002 and 2014 as well.
      *>
      *> THE RULES, and every expected value below derived from them (no observation):
      *>  14.9.49.4 GR6 b)–e) — the open-mode-scoped declarative, "for any file open in the input mode or in
      *>    the process of being opened in the input mode" and its OUTPUT / I-O / EXTEND siblings.  (R1..R4)
      *>  9.1.13.1 — the I-O status is set before the declarative runs; '47' is a READ attempted on a file not
      *>    open in the input or I-O mode (R1), '10' the at end condition (R2), '46' a sequential READ with no
      *>    valid next record after an unsuccessful one (R3), '35' a failed OPEN INPUT of a file that is not
      *>    present and not optional (R4).
      *>  14.9.30.4 GR24 a) — the at end condition's '10'.                                             (R2)
      *>
      *> EDITIONS - R1..R4 ARE IDENTICAL AT 85, 2002, 2014 AND 2023, and that is the DETERMINATION this
      *> program pins (kb/Work PB344).  Annex E.2 item 19 b) reads "READ processing.  If an exception that is
      *> not an invalid key or at end occurs, any declarative that specifies INPUT or I-O would not have been
      *> executed.  It will now be executed", which read as a behaviour change would make R1 and R3
      *> edition-dependent.  It is not one.  Annex E is INFORMATIVE, E.1 scopes it to "a list of the
      *> substantive changes between the previous COBOL standard and this Working Draft International
      *> Standard" - ONE prior edition - and its own justification says the previous standard "was not clear
      *> or missing processing of some I-O exceptions", each sub-item adding "This appears to be an error in
      *> previous standards".  A silence is not a prohibition.  For the 1985 edition the behaviour is fixed
      *> the other way by that edition's own validation suite: NIST CCVS SQ122A/SQ136A/SQ137A/SQ138A require
      *> the INPUT declarative to run for a '46' READ and SQ148A the OUTPUT one for a '47' READ - SQ137A
      *> fails with the literal remark "INPUT DECLARATIVE NOT EXECUTED" against ANSI X3.23-1985 VII-2 1.3.5,
      *> VII-51 4.6.4(5).  GR6's open-mode tier is therefore edition-invariant and all four copies of this
      *> program expect the same lines.  VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE row 26.
