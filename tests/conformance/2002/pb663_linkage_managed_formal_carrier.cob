      *> ISO §14.2.3 GR8 / GR10 + §14.8.2.3.2 — a LINKAGE formal of class
      *> POINTER or class OBJECT-REFERENCE is carried by ITS OWN class's
      *> carrier, exactly as a numeric formal is (kb/Work PB663).
      *> GR8: "If the argument is passed by reference, the activated
      *> runtime element operates as if the formal parameter occupies the
      *> same storage area as the argument" — so a BY REFERENCE pointer
      *> formal IS the caller's pointer, and a SET through it is visible
      *> to the activator at activation end.
      *> GR10, BY VALUE: the allocated record is filled by "a SET
      *> statement" when "the formal parameter is of class object or
      *> pointer" — a DETACHED copy, so the callee's SET never reaches
      *> the caller.
      *> §14.8.2.3.2: "If either the argument or the formal parameter is
      *> of class pointer, the corresponding formal parameter or argument
      *> shall be of class pointer and the corresponding items shall be
      *> of the same category" — the two sides carry the same shape, so
      *> the crossing needs no conversion at all.
      *> §14.9.4.3 SR10 bars a FORMAT 1 CALL from passing such an item BY
      *> REFERENCE, so every activation here is Format 2 (AS NESTED) —
      *> which is exactly why this crossing had no arm for so long.
