      *> ISO §13.18.60.2 — the USAGE OBJECT REFERENCE general format is a TUPLE over four
      *> INDEPENDENT axes: kind (universal | interface-name-1 | [FACTORY OF] ACTIVE-CLASS |
      *> [FACTORY OF] object-class-name-1 [ONLY]) × FACTORY × ONLY × the name.  This program

      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE RULES — NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>
      *> 1. INVOKE PB389B "NEW" RETURNING B-ONLY.  §16.2.1.2 GR1: "The New method allocates
      *>    storage for an object … and returns a reference to the created object" — an
      *>    INSTANCE object of exactly PB389B.  The receiver is described ONLY, and
      *>    §13.18.60.4 GR22 d)2.b. makes that "an instance object of the specified class";
      *>    the delivery follows the SET rules (§14.8.3.3 rule 1) and satisfies §14.9.39.3
      *>    SR12 a)1.  INVOKE B-ONLY "WHO" then resolves on the OBJECT (§14.9.23.4 GR2 —
      *>    "identifier-1 identifies an instance object … a method OF THAT OBJECT"), so the
      *>    line is  BASE.
      *>
      *> 2. SET B TO D — SR12 a)2., the subclass leg (neither side carries ONLY or FACTORY,
      *>    so a)1. and a)3. are satisfied by absence).  INVOKE B "MK" runs PB389B's MK on a
      *>    PB389D object.  MK's LOCAL-STORAGE item is described ACTIVE-CLASS, which
      *>    §13.18.60.4 GR22 e) binds to "the same class as the object that was used to
      *>    invoke the method in which this data description entry is specified" — PB389D.
      *>    SET A TO SELF is SR14 b)1. (no FACTORY phrase, an instance definition), and
      *>    INVOKE A "WHO" again resolves on the object, so the line is  DERIVED.
      *>    DISCRIMINATOR: an ACTIVE-CLASS item bound statically to its CONTAINING class
      *>    would print BASE here.
      *>
      *> 3. SET F TO PB389D — SR13: identifier-3 is described with an object-class-name, so
      *>    "the data item shall be described with the FACTORY phrase" (it is), and b)
      *>    "object-class-name-1 shall reference the same class or a subclass" (PB389D is a
      *>    subclass of PB389B).  F now holds PB389D's FACTORY object, which GR22 d)1.a.
      *>    expressly permits ("the factory object of the specified class or of a subclass").
      *>    INVOKE F "TAG" resolves the FACTORY method interface — §9.3.6 gives a class two
      *>    separate interfaces — so the line is  FTAG-D.
      *>    DISCRIMINATOR: resolving the INSTANCE roster would not find TAG at all; copying
      *>    the base's factory object would print FTAG-B.
      *>
      *> 3b. SET B B2 TO D is the MULTI-RECEIVER form §14.9.39.4 GR9 states: "a reference to
      *>    the object identified by identifier-4 is placed into EACH data item referenced by
      *>    identifier-3 in the order specified".  Both receivers then answer WHO with the
      *>    class of the object D holds — DERIVED twice.  DISCRIMINATOR: placing the
      *>    reference into only the first receiver leaves B2 null and raises EC-OO-NULL.
      *>
      *> 3c. Inside MK, SET B3 TO A is SR12 b): identifier-3 is described with an
      *>    object-class-name and identifier-4 with an ACTIVE-CLASS phrase, so b)1. (the
      *>    receiver carries no ONLY phrase), b)2. ("the class containing the data item
      *>    referenced by identifier-4 shall be the same class or a subclass" — A is written
      *>    in PB389B and the receiver is PB389B) and b)3. (neither carries FACTORY) all
      *>    hold.  SET IR TO A is SR10 c)2.: an interface-name receiver with an ACTIVE-CLASS
      *>    sender that carries no FACTORY phrase, so "the objects of the class containing
      *>    the data item referenced by identifier-4 shall implement int-1" — PB389B's
      *>    instance definition carries IMPLEMENTS PB389I.  INVOKE IR "PING" dispatches on
      *>    the object held, a PB389D instance, so the line is  IPING-D.
      *>
      *> 3d. The factory method FMK is the FACTORY-side twin: FA is described FACTORY OF
      *>    ACTIVE-CLASS, SET FA TO SELF is SR14 b)2. (the receiver carries FACTORY, and the
      *>    method IS in the factory definition), and SET FIR TO FA is SR10 c)1. — an
      *>    ACTIVE-CLASS sender WITH a FACTORY phrase, so "the factory object of the class
      *>    containing the data item referenced by identifier-4 shall implement int-1", which
      *>    PB389B's FACTORY IMPLEMENTS clause supplies.  Invoked on PB389D, the factory
      *>    object held is PB389D's, so the line is  PING-D.
      *>
      *> 3e. SET R TO B is SR10 b)2. — an interface-name receiver taking an object reference
      *>    described with an object-class-name and WITHOUT a FACTORY phrase, so "the objects
      *>    of the specified class shall implement int-1": PB389B's instance definition
      *>    carries IMPLEMENTS PB389I.  B holds the PB389D instance, so INVOKE R "PING"
      *>    prints  IPING-D.
      *>
      *> 4. SET R TO F — SR10 b)1.: the receiver is described with an interface-name, the
      *>    sender with an object-class-name AND a FACTORY phrase, so "the factory object of
      *>    the specified class shall implement int-1".  PB389B's FACTORY carries
      *>    IMPLEMENTS PB389I, so it does.  INVOKE R "PING" resolves over the interface
      *>    (§14.9.23.3 SR4e) and dispatches on the object actually held — PB389D's factory —
      *>    so the line is  PING-D.
