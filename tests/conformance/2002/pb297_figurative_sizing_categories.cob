      *> ISO 8.3.3.6.4 GR2 (with NOTE 1 - a figurative constant is
      *> associated with a data item "when ... compared with it") sizes
      *> a figurative to "the number of character positions in the
      *> associated data item", and 8.4.3.3.4 GR5 makes a
      *> reference-modified operand "a unique data item" whose
      *> positions are the SLICE's.  85/pb297_figurative_refmod_relation
      *> pins that over plain alphanumeric operands; THIS program pins
      *> the arms that carry a category or a collating sequence with
      *> them (kb/Work PB297) - each one previously sized the
      *> figurative from the BASE item's PICTURE, or (for a
      *> function-result operand, which has no PICTURE at all) from a
      *> hard-coded 1.
      *>
      *> Every expected value is DERIVED, not measured.
      *>  U01 ALPHABET AL lists Z..A, so 'Z' has the LOWEST ordinal
      *>      position and 8.3.3.6.4 GR7 makes LOW-VALUE 'Z' at
      *>      runtime.  P(1:1) is one position holding 'Z'; GR2 sizes
      *>      the figurative to ONE position -> Y.
      *>  U02 the same over two positions of a four-position item, the
      *>      shape the base-width sizing got wrong: "ZZ" against
      *>      LOW-VALUES sized to 2 -> Y.
      *>  U03 'A' is the LAST character of the literal phrase, not the
      *>      highest of the sequence: 12.3.7.4 GR7 - "Any characters
      *>      of the native collating sequence that are not specified
      *>      in the literal phrase shall assume a position in the
      *>      collating sequence that is greater than that of the
      *>      highest character specified in this literal phrase".  So
      *>      HIGH-VALUE is an unlisted character above 'A', and
      *>      "AA" is LESS than HIGH-VALUES sized to 2 -> Y.
      *>  U04 category NATIONAL: 8.4.3.3.4 GR6 keeps a national slice
      *>      national, and 8.8.4.2.9 compares under the national
      *>      collating sequence (the alphanumeric PROGRAM COLLATING
      *>      SEQUENCE above never applies to it).  NN(1:2) is two
      *>      national 'a'; ALL N"a" sized to 2 national positions is
      *>      the same -> Y.
      *>  U05 the national LOW-VALUE over a slice narrower than the
      *>      item -> Y.
      *>  U06 category BOOLEAN: 8.8.4.2.8 rule 2 right-extends the
      *>      shorter operand with boolean ZEROS, and ZERO is the only
      *>      figurative a boolean operand admits - so the pad and the
      *>      fill coincide and this line is TRUE under any sizing.  It
      *>      is here as the no-regression guard for the boolean arm
      *>      (pad '0'), which is structurally immune to the defect for
      *>      exactly the reason the alphanumeric SPACE case was.
      *>  U07 an INTERMEDIATE RESULT is an associated operand too (GR2
      *>      names "the associated data item, LITERAL, OR INTERMEDIATE
      *>      RESULT").  FUNCTION UPPER-CASE(A) is four positions
      *>      "ABAB"; ALL "AB" repeated to 4 is "ABAB" -> Y.
      *>  U08 the same intermediate result reference-modified
      *>      (8.4.3.3.3 SR2 admits a function-identifier): "ABAB"(2:2)
      *>      is "BA" and ALL "BA" sized to 2 is "BA" -> Y.
      *>  U09 WHICH SEQUENCE a figurative reads when the operand it
      *>      is compared with is itself a figurative.  8.3.3.6.4
      *>      GR1 - "When a figurative constant is used in a context
      *>      requiring national characters, the figurative constant
      *>      represents a national character value" - and GR7 - "If
      *>      the context of the figurative constant requires
      *>      national characters, the national program collating
      *>      sequence is used; otherwise, the alphanumeric program
      *>      collating sequence is used".  8.3.3.6.3 SR2 -
      *>      "Literal-1 shall be an alphanumeric, boolean, or
      *>      national literal" - makes ALL N"Z" a NATIONAL operand,
      *>      so the context is national and LOW-VALUE is the lowest
      *>      NATIONAL position, not this program's alphanumeric one
      *>      ('Z' under ALPHABET AL).  National 'Z' is not the
      *>      national low value -> N.
      *>  U10 THE AGREEMENT THIS PAIR EXISTS TO ASSERT: the same
      *>      comparison written over a national ITEM holding 'Z'
      *>      must answer identically -> N.  Reading the category off
      *>      the anchor SLOT rather than the context made U09 answer
      *>      Y and U10 answer N (kb/Work PB297).
      *>  U11-U16 THE NUMERIC ANCHOR (kb/Work PB741).  A figurative
      *>      or ALL literal compared with a NUMERIC DISPLAY item is
      *>      NOT a numeric comparison: 8.3.3.6.4 GR1 makes the
      *>      figurative an alphanumeric character value, 8.8.4.2.5
      *>      then treats the integer operand 'as though it were
      *>      moved ... to an elementary data item of the same length
      *>      in terms of character positions as the number of digits
      *>      in the integer, and of the same class and usage as the
      *>      alphanumeric ... operand', and 8.8.4.2.7 compares the
      *>      pair 'with respect to the collating sequence of
      *>      characters specified for the current alphanumeric
      *>      program collating sequence'.  Before PB741 this arm
      *>      asked the SORT-KEY classifier (14.9.40.4 GR5, where a
      *>      numeric key takes no sequence) and dropped ALPHABET AL
      *>      entirely; the golden family had no numeric item, so
      *>      only NIST NC215A saw it.
      *>  U11 LOW-VALUE is 'the character ... that has the lowest
      *>      ordinal position in the collating sequence' (8.3.3.6.4
      *>      GR7) = 'Z', AL's first listed character.  '9' is NOT in
      *>      the literal phrase, so 12.3.7.4 GR7 puts it above every
      *>      listed character, 'Z' included -> "9" > "Z" -> Y.
      *>      Without the sequence the native order answers the
      *>      OPPOSITE ('9' is x39, 'Z' is x5A) -> this leg is the
      *>      discriminator.
      *>  U12 the same comparison through the ALL-literal arm, sized
      *>      by GR2 to NUM9's one character position: "9" < "Z" is
      *>      FALSE under AL -> N.
      *>  U13 THE AGREEMENT THIS PAIR EXISTS TO ASSERT: the same
      *>      8.8.4.2.5 comparison written with a plain alphanumeric
      *>      literal instead of a figurative.  It rides a different
      *>      renderer arm and must answer identically -> Y.  Before
      *>      PB741 U11 answered N and U13 answered Y.
      *>  U14 a SIGNED numeric anchor.  8.8.4.2.5's move is governed
      *>      by 14.9.25.4 GR6a - 'If the sending operand is
      *>      described as being signed numeric, the operational sign
      *>      is not moved' - so SNUM9 compares as "9", exactly as
      *>      U11 -> Y.
      *>  U15 U14's literal twin, on the arm that already de-signed
      *>      -> Y.  The pair pins that both arms drop the sign.
      *>  U16 the multi-position case: 8.8.4.2.5 sizes the moved
      *>      operand to the NUMBER OF DIGITS (4) and GR2 sizes
      *>      LOW-VALUES to the same 4 positions, so "9999" is
      *>      compared with "ZZZZ" and the first pair decides -> Y.
