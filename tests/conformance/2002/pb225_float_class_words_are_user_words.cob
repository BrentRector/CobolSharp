      *> ISO 1989:2023 8.8.4.4.2 offers seven numeric-content class alternatives from COBOL-2014 (kb/Work PB225);
      *> 8.9 reserves their words only from 2014 (Annex E, the 2014-to-2023 change list, names none of them, and
      *> tests/version-matrix/reserved-words.json carries r2002 false / r2014 true). So at COBOL-2002 each word is
      *> an ordinary user-defined word: here a SPECIAL-NAMES class-name (12.3.7), and `IF X IS FLOAT-INFINITY`
      *> is the class-name-1 alternative, true when X consists only of that class's characters (8.8.4.4.4 GR3 f).
      *> FLOAT-NOT-A-NUMBER-QUIET is the word with a lexer token of its own since PB225 - it must stay a user word
      *> below 2014 exactly as its six siblings do. The 2014 twin is 2014/pb225_float_class_conditions.
