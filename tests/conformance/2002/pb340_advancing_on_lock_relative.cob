      *> !! ADVANCING ON LOCK IS A FORMAT-1 RULE, NOT A SEQUENTIAL-ORGANIZATION
      *> ONE (kb/Work PB340). ISO 14.9.30.4 GR22: "If the ADVANCING ON LOCK
      *> phrase is specified on the READ statement of a file open for file
      *> sharing and the record to be made available is locked by another file
      *> connector, the result of this READ statement is as if the locked record
      *> were read and then the same READ statement were executed. If the record
      *> to be made available is locked by another file connector, this action is
      *> repeated until either an unlocked record is read or the end of the file
      *> is encountered if NEXT is specified or implied, or the beginning of file
      *> is encountered if PREVIOUS is specified. A record operation conflict
      *> condition does not exist."
      *> The phrase appears in the Format-1 general format only (14.9.30.2) and
      *> 14.9.30.3 SR6 bars it under ACCESS MODE RANDOM, so it is available to
      *> EVERY organization read sequentially - here RELATIVE, ACCESS DYNAMIC.
      *> The skip-scan loop used to live only inside the sequential-organization
      *> arm of the governed read, so every READ below answered '51' - precisely
      *> the status GR22 says cannot arise.
      *> 14.9.30.3 SR9 is exercised by T3: "If neither the NEXT phrase nor the
      *> PREVIOUS phrase is specified and ACCESS MODE DYNAMIC is specified in the
      *> file control entry for file-name-1, the NEXT phrase is implied if any of
      *> the following phrases is specified: ADVANCING, AT END, or NOT AT END."
