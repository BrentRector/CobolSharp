      *> ISO §14.9.4 — ROUNDED MODE (COBOL-2002), all eight modes + the bare-ROUNDED default.
      *> Rounding 2.25 / 2.21 / 2.20 to one fraction digit exposes how each mode resolves the
      *> dropped digits (the three NEAREST-* modes differ only on the 2.25 tie):
      *>   TRUNCATION              2.25 -> 2.2   (toward zero)
      *>   NEAREST-AWAY-FROM-ZERO  2.25 -> 2.3   (tie away)        = bare ROUNDED default
      *>   NEAREST-EVEN            2.25 -> 2.2   (tie to even)
      *>   NEAREST-TOWARD-ZERO     2.25 -> 2.2   (tie toward zero)
      *>   AWAY-FROM-ZERO          2.21 -> 2.3   (always up in magnitude)
      *>   TOWARD-GREATER          2.21 -> 2.3   (+inf / ceiling)
      *>   TOWARD-LESSER           2.21 -> 2.2   (-inf / floor)
      *>   PROHIBITED              2.20 -> 2.2   (exact: no rounding needed)
