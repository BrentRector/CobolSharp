      *> ISO 14.9.39.4 GR7: "If the FALSE phrase is specified, the literal in the FALSE phrase of the
      *> VALUE clause associated with condition-name-1 is placed in the conditional variable according
      *> to the rules for the VALUE clause, except that when the conditional variable is an
      *> alphanumeric group item, bit group item, or national group item to which a table is
      *> subordinate, its length is determined as specified in 13.18.38, OCCURS clause. If the length
      *> of the conditional variable is zero, the SET statement leaves it unchanged."  GR6 states the
      *> SAME two sentences for the TRUE phrase, which is why one program witnesses both arms.
      *>
      *> Expected values, COMPUTED FROM THE STANDARD (not measured):
      *>   13.18.38.3 SR16 admits integer-1 = 0, so G's length runs 0..4 characters with N.
      *>   N = 4 -> the conditional variable is 4 characters; GR6 places literal-2 "AAAA" by the VALUE
      *>            clause's rules (13.18.63.3 SR4, an alphanumeric group item) -> G = "AAAA", and
      *>            8.8.4.5.3 GR2's relation over 8.8.4.2.7 makes G-ON TRUE.
      *>   N = 2 -> the conditional variable is 2 characters; GR7 places literal-4 "BBBB" by those same
      *>            rules, so the group receives it left-justified with the excess truncated on the
      *>            right (14.9.25.4 GR4) -> G = "BB".
      *>   N = 0 -> the length IS zero, so GR6's last sentence leaves the conditional variable
      *>            unchanged; restoring N = 2 must therefore still show the "BB" the FALSE store left.
      *>
      *> The FALSE phrase and SET condition-name TO FALSE are a COBOL-2002 introduction (constructs.json
      *> rows value-false-phrase-2002 / set-condition-false-2002), which is why this program lives in
      *> the 2002 corpus; negative/pb555-set-false-below-2002 pins the edge below it.
