      *> ISO §13.18.42.2 format — every PROPERTY clause spelling works
      *> General format: PROPERTY [ WITH NO { GET | SET } ] [ IS FINAL ]
      *> with PROPERTY, NO, GET, SET, FINAL underlined (required) and
      *> WITH, IS not underlined (optional words, §5.2.3;

      *> Semantics each spelling must carry:
      *>   §13.18.42.4 GR1 "If the GET phrase is not specified, the
      *>   PROPERTY clause causes a method to be defined for the
      *>   containing object." (the get property method)
      *>   cite.py --check 13.18.42.4 -> OK  §13.18.42.4 1)  (General
      *>   rules)
      *>   §13.18.42.4 GR2 "If the SET phrase is not specified, the
      *>   PROPERTY clause causes a method to be defined for the
      *>   containing object." (the set property method)
      *>   cite.py --check 13.18.42.4 -> OK  §13.18.42.4 2)  (General
      *>   rules)
      *>   §8.4.3.9.3 SR1 "Property-name-1 shall be an object property
      *>   specified in the REPOSITORY paragraph." (hence the four
      *>   PROPERTY entries in L1C21L's REPOSITORY)

      *> The properties live in the FACTORY working-storage (§13.18.42.3
      *> SR1 permits it), so the factory object is used and no instance
      *> is ever created. The four spellings:
      *>   PGET  PROPERTY NO SET              (WITH omitted)   get only
      *>   PSET  PROPERTY WITH NO GET IS FINAL (full, GET)     set only
      *>   PBOTH PROPERTY FINAL               (IS omitted)     get + set
      *>   PFIN  PROPERTY WITH NO SET IS FINAL (full, SET)     get only
      *> Expected output, derived (PIC 9(3) unsigned, DISPLAY shows all
      *> three digits):
      *>   "PGET 011"  — get method of PGET returns its VALUE 11.
      *>   "PSET 005"  — MOVE 5 to PSET invokes its set method; the
      *>                 factory method SHOWSET displays the item (there
      *>                 is no get method to read it through).
      *>   "PBOTH 007" — set method stores 7, get method returns it.
      *>   "PFIN 044"  — get method of PFIN returns its VALUE 44.
