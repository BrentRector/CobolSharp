      *> the specified value and data items of class message-tag, class object, and class pointer are
      *> initialized to null" - with GR4 c) putting that among the occasions "when the object or runtime element
      *> is placed in initial state". So a pointer-class item is null at initial state with NO VALUE clause
      *> written, which is exactly what 13.18.63.3 SR9 forbids writing one for.
