      *> 1. SR6 through a REDEFINES view: VB2 starts at bit 8 of W - the
      *>    redefinition "starts at the first bit of the data item referenced
      *>    by data-name-2" (13.18.44.4 GR1) and VB1's 8 bits fill the first byte
      *>    (8.5.1.6.3) - so it IS "aligned on a byte boundary" and crosses
      *>    BY REFERENCE; the callee's MOVE lands in W's second byte through
      *>    14.2.3 GR8 ("the same storage area"): VB2=10101010 before,
      *>    01010101 after, and VB1 untouched: 11110000.
      *> 2. ANY LENGTH at a Format-2 CALL. SR11 bans it in FORMAT 1 and
      *>    SR18 bans identifier-4 (BY CONTENT / BY VALUE) in Format 2; a
      *>    Format-2 BY REFERENCE identifier-2 is instead subject to
      *>    14.8.2.3.2, whose rule d) makes an ANY LENGTH formal match any
      *>    length ("its length is considered to match the length of the
      *>    corresponding argument") and rule e) lets an ANY LENGTH argument
      *>    meet an ANY LENGTH formal. PB240IN receives X (6 characters) as
      *>    its ANY LENGTH L (13.18.2.4 GR1b - six repetitions): L=ABCDEF;
      *>    forwards L BY REFERENCE AS NESTED to PB240LF's ANY LENGTH M:
      *>    M=ABCDEF; whose MOVE ALL "Z" fills the six positions of X's
      *>    storage: X=ZZZZZZ.
