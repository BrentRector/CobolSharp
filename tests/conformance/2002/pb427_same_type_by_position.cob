      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 8.5.3.1 -- "Two typed items are of the same type when:
      *>   - The items are described with TYPE clauses that reference equivalent type declarations; or
      *>   - The items are described as subordinate items in equivalent type declarations, starting at
      *>     the same relative byte pr bit position and having the same length in bytes or bits."
      *> (the "pr" is the transcription's OCR slip for "or"; quoted verbatim so the cite check is honest)
      *> and "Two type declarations are considered equivalent when they have the same type-name, both have
      *> the same presence or absence of the EXTERNAL clause and the STRONG phrase, and for each elementary
      *> item in one type declaration there is a corresponding elementary item in the other type declaration,
      *> starting at the same relative byte or bit position and having the same length in bytes or bits."
      *>
      *> The four legs below are the FOUR THINGS THAT PREDICATE HAS TO GET RIGHT, and every one of them was
      *> wrong or missing before kb/Work PB427, when the test was a type-NAME string plus a member-NAME path:
      *>   A  alternative 2 across DIFFERENT names -- OUTERG and INNERG are two differently-named subgroups
      *>      of one declaration, both at relative bit position 0 and both 32 bits long, so they ARE of the
      *>      same type and the MOVE is legal.  The name-path test refused it.
      *>   B  alternative 1 -- two whole items described with TYPE clauses referencing one declaration.
      *>   C  the same predicate under 8.8.4.2.3 SR1, the comparison rule, so the MOVE arm and the compare
      *>      arm cannot answer differently.
      *>   D  EQUIVALENT declarations in TWO source elements -- the contained program declares its own
      *>      SHAPE-T with the same name, the same STRONG phrase, no EXTERNAL clause and an identical
      *>      elementary layout, so 8.5.3.1's equivalence holds across the element boundary and both the
      *>      MOVE (14.9.25.3 SR2) and the CALL argument crossing (14.8.2.2, "If either the formal parameter
      *>      or the corresponding argument is a strongly-typed group item, both shall be of the same type")
      *>      are conforming.  The negative pb427-same-type-nonequivalent-declarations is this same shape
      *>      with a NON-equivalent declaration and is rejected.
      *> TYPEDEF ... STRONG is a COBOL-2002 introduction (13.18.58), so 2002 is the introducing edition.
