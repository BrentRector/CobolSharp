      *>
      *> THE RULES. §8.8.4.2.1: "Comparisons are defined for the following:"
      *>   5) "Two operands of class national."
      *>   7) "Two operands of different classes where each operand is from the set of
      *>      classes alphanumeric, alphabetic, or national."
      *> and, same clause: "A national group item or a bit group item shall be treated as
      *> an elementary national data item" ... and "A class alphabetic operand shall be
      *> treated as though it were an operand of class alphanumeric."
      *> §8.8.4.2.6: "The alphanumeric operand is treated as though it were converted and
      *> moved in accordance with the rules of the MOVE statement from an alphanumeric
      *> elementary data item to a temporary elementary data item of class national with
      *> the same length in terms of character positions as the alphanumeric operand."
      *> §8.8.4.2.10 (standard comparison; no PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE is declared and
      *> only SPACE and A-D are compared, ordered SPACE < A < B < C < D):
      *>   1) "The operand that contains the character that is positioned higher in the
      *>      national collating sequence is the greater operand."
      *>   2) "comparison proceeds as though the shorter operand were extended on the
      *>      right by sufficient national spaces".
