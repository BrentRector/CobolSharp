      *> 8.3.3.6.3 SR2 gives `ALL literal-1` its literal's own class ("Literal-1 shall be an alphanumeric,
      *> boolean, or national literal"), so `ALL N"AB"` is class NATIONAL and the two lines below are the
      *> SAME comparison: one class-national operand and one class-alphanumeric operand. They answered
      *> OPPOSITELY (kb/Work PB649) because the figurative branch of the relation renderer derived the
      *> comparison class from ONE operand - the non-figurative anchor - and then handed that answer back to
      *> itself as the figurative's category, so the pair rule was asked a two-operand question with one
      *> operand's answer twice. The decision is now made once, from both operands, and both branches read it.

      *> written, so Z=1, Y=2 ... B=25, A=26. Under AL, "AB" collates AFTER "AC" (position 2: B=25 > C=24).
      *> The NATIONAL sequence is untouched by it (12.3.6 GR11 names a FOR NATIONAL alphabet separately and

      *>   FIG-NAT - ALL N"AB" vs NB: both national, equal values, so NOT less                           => 0
