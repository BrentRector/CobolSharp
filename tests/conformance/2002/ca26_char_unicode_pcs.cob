      *> CA26 (CONFORMANCE-FIX-QUEUE): the native alphanumeric REPERTOIRE is Unicode (UTF-16 code units) — the
      *> established design — so the alphanumeric program collating sequence has up to 0xFFFF positions (ISO §15.15.3
      *> r1). Under a non-native PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE the ALPHABET remaps only its Latin-1 domain (256 code
      *> units); a code unit BEYOND it keeps its NATIVE position (§12.3.7 k)3 — unlisted characters follow the
      *> positioned set in native order). So CHAR(257) is the code unit at ordinal position 257 = U+0100 (no
      *> EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION), ORD round-trips it to 257, and U+0100 collates ABOVE every Latin-1 character —
      *> including CHAR(256) = X"FF" (the highest positioned character). Pre-fix the weights domain was masked to 8
      *> bits (& 0xFF): CHAR(257) yielded the §15.3 one-space default and U+0100 aliased to X"00"'s low weight.
