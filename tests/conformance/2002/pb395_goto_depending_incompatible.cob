      *> ISO §14.9.17.4 GR2 (GO TO, Format 2), whole: "If the value of identifier-1 is 1, 2, …, or n, control is
      *> transferred to the first statement of the procedure named by procedure-name-1, procedure-name-2, …, or
      *> procedure-name-n, respectively. If the content of identifier-1 is not numeric, the EC-DATA-INCOMPATIBLE
      *> exception condition is set to exist. If the value of identifier-1 is anything other than the positive or
      *> unsigned integers 1 through n, no transfer occurs and control passes to the next statement."
      *> All three halves are measured here, in that order.
      *>
      *> The condition is the §14.6.13.2 rule 2 sibling — "When the content of a numeric sending item … is
      *> referenced during the execution of a statement and the content of that sending operand would evaluate to
      *> false in a numeric class condition, the result of the reference is undefined and an EC-DATA-INCOMPATIBLE
      *> exception condition is set to exist" — reached here through a REDEFINES window holding "AB". Table 13
      *> makes it FATAL, so the declarative's RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT (§14.9.33.4 GR2) is what keeps the run unit
      *> alive past it; GR2 leaves the RESULT of the reference undefined, so nothing here displays a selected
      *> paragraph — only that the condition was raised and that control resumed at the statement after the GO TO.
      *>
      *> 2002 is the introducing edition of the OBSERVABLE: the §7.3 compiler-directive facility (>>TURN) and the
      *> exception-condition declaratives are COBOL-2002 introductions, so the EC half cannot be written at 85 —
      *> see conformance:negative/pb395-turn-data-incompatible-below-2002. The transfer and fall-through halves
      *> are edition-independent.

      *> kb/Work PB395 / PB230: EC-DATA-INCOMPATIBLE used to be armed by a STATEMENT-KIND test (`node is
      *> BoundMove`) where the clause hangs it on a SENDING-OPERAND reference, so GO TO … DEPENDING read the
      *> incompatible item in silence. No golden covered the §14.6.13.2 leg for any verb; this is that golden.
