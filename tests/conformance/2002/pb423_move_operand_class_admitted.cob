      *> kb/Work PB423. ISO 1989:2023 14.9.25.3 SR1 - "The class of identifier-1 or identifier-2 shall not be

      *> rejects the classes the rule NAMES and nothing else. This program declares the very items whose classes
      *> SR1 bars and then references them only where the standard admits them, so every statement is legal and
      *> the widened screen must stay silent on all of them.

      *>                                    data-pointer data item may appear in; MOVE is not on that list.
