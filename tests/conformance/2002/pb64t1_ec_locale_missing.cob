      *> ISO 14.9.39.4 GR24 — "If the locale specified by locale-name-1 is not available, the EC-LOCALE-MISSING
      *> exception condition is set to exist" — and 8.2.1 / 12.3.7.4 GR5 for a NAMED IS LOCALE collating sequence whose
      *> locale is not available at the point of use (DESIGN-locale-facility L1 item 4: availability is a RUN-TIME
      *> property — the compiler never resolves an external identification, so the program compiles). Table 13
      *> (14.6.13.1.6) makes EC-LOCALE-MISSING FATAL; with checking on the USE declarative observes it and RESUME AT
      *> NEXT STATEMENT continues (kb/Work PB64 T1).
      *>
      *> ⛔ THE POINT IS THAT THE CONDITION IS OBSERVED, not merely registered (DESIGN-locale-facility 4.10): a
      *> registered exception-name with no raise site is a zero-fan-out result that reads as coverage.

      *> What each line proves:
      *>   HANDLED #1 / SET  — SET LOCALE LC_COLLATE TO XX (an external identification no environment provides)
      *>                       raises; the statement is unsuccessful, so the current collation is still the root
      *>                       ("nz" > "ñu").
      *>   HANDLED #2 / NAMED — a relation under the PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE bound to the missing locale (ALPHABET
      *>                       BAD IS LOCALE XX) raises AT USE; the IF statement is interrupted (14.6.13.1.3 #5 — the
      *>                       declarative runs, RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT), so VERDICT keeps its initial "?" — displayed
      *>                       to prove the statement did not silently complete.
      *>   GOOD              — a declared locale that IS available (ES) switches without any condition.
      *> Non-ASCII appears only inside literals (UTF-8 source); every DISPLAY is ASCII.
