      *>                   closes. Were NO OTHER fixed in the file,

      *>   A1=00 A2=00     both ALL OTHER connectors open it INPUT at
      *>                   once (rule 3).
      *>   NO-WHILE=61     NO OTHER while others have it open (rule 1).
      *>   NO-ALONE=00     after both CLOSE, NO OTHER opens alone.
      *>   A1-WHILE=61     an ALL OTHER OPEN while the NO OTHER
      *>                   connector has it open (rule 1).
      *>   A1-CREATE=00    F-A1 re-creates the file (OPEN OUTPUT),
      *>                   writes, closes.
      *>   NO-AFTER=00     F-NO still opens it: ALL OTHER was not kept
      *>                   by the file either.
