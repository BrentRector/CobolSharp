      *> kb/Work PB1549 - a failed SET ... TO ADDRESS OF PROGRAM raises
      *> the FATAL EC-PROGRAM-NOT-FOUND, and only a RESUME lets the run
      *> unit continue past it. (The unhandled arm - abnormal run-unit

      *>
      *> THE RULES.
      *> §8.4.3.13.4 GR4: "If the runtime system cannot locate the
      *>   program, the EC-PROGRAM-NOT-FOUND exception condition is set
      *>   to exist and the value of the address-identifier is the
      *>   predefined address NULL."
      *>   OK  §8.4.3.13.4 4)  (General rules)
      *> §14.6.13.1.3 5): with checking enabled and an applicable USE
      *>   statement "the associated declarative is executed. If
      *>   execution of the declarative completes normally the
      *>   execution of the run unit is terminated abnormally" - NOTE 2:
      *>   "The user is able to continue by using a RESUME statement".
      *>   OK  §14.6.13.1.3 5)  (Fatal exception conditions)
      *> §14.9.33.4 GR2: NEXT STATEMENT transfers control to an
      *>   implicit CONTINUE that "immediately follows the end of the
      *>   statement that was executing" - here, the failed SET.
      *>   OK  §14.9.33.4 2) a)  (General rules)
      *> §14.9.33.4 GR3: "If procedure-name-1 is specified, control is
      *>   transferred to procedure-name-1 as if a GO TO
      *>   procedure-name-1 were executed."
      *>   OK  §14.9.33.4 3)  (General rules)
      *>
      *> DERIVATION.
      *> PQ=SET -- PB1549B is a program of this run unit, so ADDRESS OF
      *>   PROGRAM locates it; no condition is raised.
      *> NF-HANDLED -- PB1549Z is not in the run unit: GR4 raises
      *>   EC-PROGRAM-NOT-FOUND, the declarative runs (5)), and
      *>   WS-MODE = "N" takes RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT (GR2) ...
      *> PP=NULL -- ... so the IF after the SET runs, and GR4 made the
      *>   address-identifier NULL.
      *> EC1=EC-PROGRAM-NOT-FOUND -- the last exception status (checking
      *>   is enabled, §14.6.13.1.1).
      *> NF-HANDLED -- the second failed SET runs the declarative again;
      *>   WS-MODE = "P" now takes RESUME AT M-AFTER (GR3), so the
      *>   DISPLAY "NOT-REACHED" after the SET never runs ...
      *> AT-M-AFTER -- ... and control continues at M-AFTER.
