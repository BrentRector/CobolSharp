      *> kb/Work PB246 - FUNCTION SQRT on the NATIVE carrier: ISO 15.84.4 r4 and 15.84.3 r2, the two rules that
      *> meet on the one body and neither of which was implemented there.
      *>
      *> 15.84.4 r4: "When native arithmetic is in effect, the returned value is the ABSOLUTE VALUE of the
      *> approximation of the square root of argument-1." The phrase is not decoration. IEC 60559 mandates
      *> sqrt(-0) = -0 EXACTLY so that sqrt is not the absolute value there, while |-0.0| is +0.0 - so negative
      *> zero is the unique argument on which r4's "absolute value" does any work, and it is a LEGAL argument-1
      *> because 15.84.3 r2 admits zero. A COMP-2 item reaches -0.0 by ordinary native underflow: the product of
      *> a negative tiny and a positive tiny is a negative zero, which NZ below DISPLAYs with its sign (the
      *> unquantized float channel is IEEE-faithful), so the input is observable BEFORE the function sees it.
      *>   NZ  = -0      the argument, proving the probe really is negative zero and not plain zero
      *>   SQL = 0       15.84.4 r4 over the receiver-less/float arm: |sqrt(-0.0)| = |-0.0| = +0.0, DISPLAYed
      *>                 without a sign. A bare Math.Sqrt answers -0 here; that was the defect.
      *>   SQR = 0       the same value stored into a COMP-2 receiver, which keeps the signed zero bit for bit
      *>   SQ4 = 00200   15.84.4 r4 over a fixed-point receiver: sqrt(4) = 2 exactly (9(3)V99, implied point)
      *>
      *> 15.84.3 r2: "The value of argument-1 shall be zero or positive." This is a VALUE constraint, so 15.3
      *> rule 14 makes it EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION at run time rather than a compile-time reject - with checking off
      *> the implementor defines the result (docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-90: the numeric zero), and with checking
      *> on the condition is raised and a declarative sees it. The guard is now EXPLICIT at the body beside
      *> LOG's and LOG10's; before, the only detector was the NaN artifact of Math.Sqrt, which is not total -
      *> a standard-decimal operand whose exponent is at or below -324 converts to double as -0.0, on which
      *> Math.Sqrt answers -0.0 and not NaN, so a genuinely negative argument-1 was accepted in silence.
      *>   SQN = 00000   checking OFF: the 15.3 rule 14 default result, zero
      *>   "  RAISED" then SQC = 00000: checking ON, the declarative fires and RESUMEs - the branch
      *>                 nothing anywhere exercised for SQRT
