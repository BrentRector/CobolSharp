      *> kb/Work PB465 - SET pointer UP/DOWN BY states TWO rules over one statement, and they are two rules
      *> with two exception conditions. 14.9.39.4 GR19 tests the AMOUNT's value: "If arithmetic-expression-3
      *> does not evaluate to an integer, the EC-SIZE-ADDRESS exception condition is set to exist, the
      *> execution of the SET statement is unsuccessful, and the content of identifier-9 is unchanged."
      *> GR20 tests the RESULTING ADDRESS: "... If this new address is outside the range of values allowed by
      *> the implementor for a data-pointer data item, the EC-RANGE-PTR exception condition is set to exist and
      *> the value of the data item referenced by identifier-9 is unchanged."
      *>
      *> SET pointer UP/DOWN BY is a COBOL-2002 introduction (ConstructRegistry pointer-arithmetic-2002), and
      *> so is the exception-condition mechanism it needs (>>TURN, 7.3.25), so 2002 is where the rule's own
      *> behaviour is pinned. The text of GR19 and GR20 is unchanged across 2002, 2014 and 2023.
      *>
      *> The implementor range GR20 names is docs/CONFORMANCE.md 7 DOC-A.1-216: the signed 64-bit interval of
      *> character-position displacements. 1.0E19 exceeds it and IS an integer, which is exactly the case the
      *> two rules had been conflated over - it used to set EC-SIZE-ADDRESS and abort the run unit.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE SPEC AND NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>
      *> A=[C]       2.0 IS an integer value, so GR19's antecedent is FALSE and GR20 displaces the address by
      *>             2 character positions. BUF position 3 holds "C".
      *> SIZE=...    2.5 does not evaluate to an integer: GR19 sets EC-SIZE-ADDRESS, Table 13 makes it Fatal,
      *>             the declarative runs and RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT (14.9.33) continues. FUNCTION
      *>             EXCEPTION-STATUS returns the name in a 31-character alphanumeric field, space-padded.
      *> B=[C]       GR19's other two consequents: unsuccessful, identifier-9 unchanged - still position 3.
      *> RANGE=...   1.0E19 IS an integer, so GR19 does not apply; the address it would produce is outside the
      *>             implementor range, so GR20 sets EC-RANGE-PTR instead. Same 31-character field.
      *> C=[C]       GR20's other consequent: "the value of the data item referenced by identifier-9 is
      *>             unchanged" - still position 3.
      *> D=[A]       DOWN BY 2 decrements by 2 (GR20), back to position 1.
