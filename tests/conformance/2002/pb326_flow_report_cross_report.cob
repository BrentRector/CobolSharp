      *> ISO §14.9.49.4 GR10 — THE SCOPE OF "the range of a declarative procedure".  GR10 attaches no element
      *> qualifier to the range, where its nearest neighbour §14.9.18.4 GR6 attaches one explicitly for
      *> EC-FLOW-GLOBAL-GOBACK ("… and that USE statement is specified in the same program as the GOBACK
      *> statement").  The standard says "the same program" when it means it, and it does not say "the same
      *> report" anywhere.  So a GENERATE executed inside report R-A's USE BEFORE REPORTING procedure is inside
      *> the range EVEN WHEN IT NAMES A DIFFERENT REPORT — which a per-report flag would miss.  This program is
      *> the arm that a report-scoped guard passes and a correct one does not (kb/Work PB326).
      *>
      *> DERIVATION OF THE EXPECTED OUTPUT.  Both reports are OPENed and INITIATEd.  GENERATE DET-A presents
      *> DET-A, running BR-P first (§14.9.49.4 GR8/GR9d); BR-P PERFORMs GEN-B, whose GENERATE DET-B is inside
      *> the range: EC-FLOW-REPORT is raised (HANDLED=), the GENERATE is unsuccessful, and R-B's state is
      *> unchanged — so R-B has still had NO successful GENERATE.  TERMINATE R-B therefore takes §14.9.46.4 GR2
      *> ("no report group is processed at all") and R-B's file is still empty at that point.  Back in MAIN,
      *> OUTSIDE every declarative, WS-N is set to 7 and R-B is re-INITIATEd and GENERATEd normally — the proof
      *> that the range was LEFT (the guard is a bracket, not a latch).  Expected: HANDLED=EC-FLOW-REPORT,
      *> N=1 (BR-P ran exactly once), DONE, and R-B's file holding EXACTLY ONE line, B=7.
