      *> ISO 14.6.6 r5 — "For a SORT or MERGE statement specifying an alphabet-name associated with a locale in the
      *> COLLATING SEQUENCE phrase, category LC_COLLATE in the associated locale is used for that statement. A locale
      *> switch during execution of a SORT or MERGE statement has no effect on the processing of that SORT or MERGE
      *> statement." (kb/Work PB64 T1 — the SORT snapshot rule owed with SET LOCALE; DESIGN-locale-facility §12 T3.)
      *>
      *> The alphabet CUR is the locale CURRENT at use (12.3.7.4 GR7e). The INPUT PROCEDURE of the FIRST sort switches
      *> LC_COLLATE to Spanish BETWEEN two RELEASEs — the sequence the sort phase uses is the one in effect when the
      *> SORT statement BEGAN (the harness's pinned root), so "ñu" sorts BEFORE "nz" (root: n-tilde is n + tilde, then
      *> u < z decides). The SECOND sort begins after the switch, so it uses Spanish: n-tilde is a primary after n and
      *> "nz" sorts before "ñu".
      *> Non-ASCII appears only inside literals (UTF-8 source); every DISPLAY is ASCII.
