      *> kb/Work PB584 - A MIXED BIT/CHARACTER GROUP'S COMPILE-TIME IMAGE IS COMPOSED BY 8.5.1.6.3's RUNS,
      *> not member by member, and the SEED a REDEFINES alias starts from is the same composition the run-time
      *> AsImage() produces.  Every expected value below is computed from the rule text before the run.
      *>
      *> ISO 8.5.1.6.3 (Alignment of data items of usage bit) - alignment "is at the next bit position in
      *>   storage when that item is: - an elementary bit data item immediately following an elementary bit data
      *>   item or bit group item of the same level".  Two same-level bit members therefore SHARE a byte; an
      *>   item that is not a bit item goes at the first bit position of the first available byte, and implicit
      *>   filler bits are generated "as needed to increase the number of bits to fill an integral number of
      *>   characters".
      *> ISO 13.18.44.4 GR1 - "Storage association for the subject of the entry starts at the first bit of the
      *>   data item referenced by data-name-2 and continues over an area sufficient to contain the number of
      *>   bits required by the data item referenced by the subject of the entry."  So the alias sees exactly
      *>   the bytes the group lays out.
      *> ISO 8.3.3.6.4 GR4 - the zero format "represents the numeric value '0', one or more of the boolean
      *>   character '0', or one or more of the character '0' ... depending on context" (a bit leaf's VALUE ZERO
      *>   is boolean zeros, one per declared position).
      *> ISO 8.3.3.6.4 GR2 - a figurative constant in a VALUE clause has "the string of characters ... repeated
      *>   character by character until the size of the resultant string is greater than or equal to the number
      *>   of character positions in the associated data item" (ALL B"1" over four boolean positions is 1111).
      *> ISO 15.44.4 - FUNCTION ORD returns "the ordinal position of the argument in the collating sequence",
      *>   which is the byte value + 1; it is how this file reads the composed BYTES rather than trusting a
      *>   DISPLAY of a control character.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE SPEC:
      *>   MIX   H1=0100 H2=0001 (one run, bits 0..7 = 0100 0001 = 0x41) H3="B" = 0x42.
      *>         ORD of the alias bytes: 65+1=66 and 66+1=67.   BEFORE: 0x40 and 0x10, H2 read 0000 and the
      *>         character member was lost - each bit member had been padded to its OWN byte.
      *>   CTRL  the byte-identical group WITHOUT the alias - the record-struct lane, which has always walked
      *>         the runs - must read the same members.  A control that drifts is the failure this file catches.
      *>   RT    MOVE "Ca" TO the alias then read the members: 0x43 = 0100 0011, so H1=0100 H2=0011 H3="a".
      *>         The SEED and the run-time image are one composition or this leg disagrees with MIX.
      *>   FIG   F1 VALUE ZERO = 0000, F2 VALUE ALL B"1" = 1111, byte 0 = 0000 1111 = 0x0F -> ORD 16;
      *>         F3 = "C" = 0x43 -> ORD 68.   BEFORE: the figurative seeded FOUR carrier characters where the
      *>         packed image is ONE byte, so the bytes were '0' (0x30) and '1' (0x31).
      *>   PURE  a PURE bit group behind an alias: K1 VALUE ALL B"1" = 1111, K2 VALUE ZERO = 0000, the packed
      *>         byte is 1111 0000 = 0xF0 -> ORD 241.   BEFORE: K1 came back 0000 through the alias and 1111
      *>         without one - the bit-carrier lane had no ALL-literal arm.
      *>   ROOT  a root-level bit leaf behind an alias: VALUE ZERO over four positions, packed with four filler
      *>         zero bits = 0x00 -> ORD 1.
      *>   RUN2  a THREE-member run crossing a byte: T1=1100 T2=0011 T3=1010 is 12 bits, ceil(12/8) = 2
      *>         characters, packed high-order first as 1100 0011 / 1010 0000 = 0xC3 0xA0 -> ORD 196 and 161;
      *>         T4 is not a bit item, so it starts at the first AVAILABLE byte, byte 2 = "D" = 0x44 -> ORD 69.
      *>
      *> EDITIONS: boolean data (the PICTURE symbol 1, USAGE BIT) and GROUP-USAGE are COBOL-2002 introductions,
      *> so 2002 is the introducing edition and this file lives here; the composition rule does not vary by
      *> edition, so the corpus keeps ONE copy (the negative below 2002 is
      *> tests/conformance/negative/pb584-mixed-bit-group-below-2002).
