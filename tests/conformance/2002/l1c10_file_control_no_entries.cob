      *> Row pinned: FMT-12.4.4.2 (the "[ file-control-entry ] ..."
      *> optional-repetition arm: zero entries).
      *>  General format: "FILE-CONTROL. [ file-control-entry ] ..."
      *>  The brackets make every file-control-entry optional, so the
      *>  paragraph header and its separator period alone are a
      *>  complete, legal FILE-CONTROL paragraph. §12.4.2 lets it
      *>  stand alone in the INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION (the
      *>  i-o-control-paragraph is also optional).

      *> Derivation: the program is legal source, so it compiles and
      *> runs; the single DISPLAY gives
      *>  FC-EMPTY=OK
      *> A compiler requiring at least one entry would reject it.
