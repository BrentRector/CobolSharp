      *> kb/Work PB327 - A NATIONAL LEAF IN AN FD RECORD. 13.18.60.4 GR8
      *> leaves a national character's storage size to the implementor
      *> ("National characters shall be represented in the storage of
      *> the computer as characters of a uniform size equal to or a
      *> multiple of the size of characters in the computer's
      *> alphanumeric character set") and COBOL.NET pins TWO bytes,
      *> UTF-16BE, high-order first (determination D-N1). So S-REC is
      *> an EIGHT-byte record: three national positions (six bytes)
      *> then two alphanumeric ones. The secondary 01 S-BYTES shares
      *> that area (9.1.2 - records are aligned on its leftmost byte),
      *> so ORD over each of its positions reads the record image BYTE
      *> BY BYTE: a one-byte-per-position layout would put "A" at
      *> byte 1 and a little-endian pair would put it at byte 1 too,
      *> so the 001/066 pair pins BOTH the width and the order.
      *> The EXTERNAL leg is 14.9.27.4 GR5's guarantee - "If the file
      *> connector associated with file-name-1 is an external file
      *> connector, there is only one record area associated with the
      *> file connector for the run unit" - which places NO restriction
      *> on the record's categories or usages: the called program
      *> WRITEs through the SAME connector and the SAME record area,
      *> and both records come back in order.
