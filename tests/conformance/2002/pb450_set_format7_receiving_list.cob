      *> !! SET FORMAT 7'S RECEIVING OPERAND IS A REPEATED BRACE, AND THE TWO SPELLINGS MIX. kb/Work PB450.
      *>
      *> ISO 14.9.39.2 Format 7, RENDERED from the printed page (PDF p760 / folio 730), is
      *>     SET { ADDRESS OF data-name-1 | identifier-5 } ... TO identifier-6
      *> The brace is a PLAIN required choice - exactly one of the two spellings - and the `...` sits OUTSIDE
      *> it, so a Format-7 statement carries one or more receiving operands, each independently either
      *> spelling and mixable in any order, over ONE sender. Its own figure note says so in words: "The braces
      *> are a plain required choice - exactly one of the two alternatives - and the following `...` repeats
      *> the braced receiving operand" (python scripts/spec/cite.py --check 14.9.39.2
      *> "repeats the braced receiving operand" -> OK).
      *>
      *> Before this the grammar held TWO fixed productions split on the SENDER's spelling, each hard-coding
      *> arity one, so every statement below was `error COBOL0001` at every edition and neither SR17 nor SR18
      *> was ever asked about a second operand.
      *>
      *> Expected values, COMPUTED FROM THE STANDARD (not measured):
      *>   14.9.39.4 GR12 - "If identifier-5 is specified, the address identified by identifier-6 is stored in
      *>     each data item referenced by identifier-5 in the order specified" (--check OK).
      *>   14.9.39.4 GR13 - "If data-name-1 is specified, the address identified by identifier-6 is assigned
      *>     to each based item referenced by data-name-1 in the order specified" (--check OK).
      *>   8.4.3.11.4 GR1 - "Data-address-identifier creates a unique data item of class pointer and category
      *>     data-pointer that contains the address of identifier-1" (--check OK), which is what lets
      *>     `ADDRESS OF x` stand as identifier-6, and 8.6.5 makes a based item's own value its implicit
      *>     data-address pointer, so a rebased B1 reads through whatever record its address names.
      *>   T1: P1 and P2 both take &REC-A (GR12); B1 and B2 are both then based at &REC-A (GR13) -> "AAAA AAAA"
      *>   T2: the MIXED statement `SET ADDRESS OF B1 P2 TO P3` gives B1 the address in P3 (&REC-B, GR13) and
      *>       stores that same address into P2 (GR12); B2 then rebases from P2          -> "BBBB BBBB"
      *>   T3: both operands are data-address-identifiers                                 -> "AAAA"
      *>   T4: a THREE-operand mixed list, proving the repetition is not two              -> "BBBB BBBB BBBB"
      *>
      *> !! WHAT THIS GOLDEN DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM: GR12's "in the order specified" is only OBSERVABLE
      *> through its second sentence ("Item identification of the data item referenced by identifier-5 is done
      *> immediately before the value of that data item is changed"), which needs a SUBSCRIPTED identifier-5.
      *> 13.18.60.3 SR14 makes that unwritable - a USAGE POINTER item may appear only at level 1 or under a
      *> STRONG type declaration, so there is no conforming pointer table to subscript - and one sender
      *> address reaches every receiver, so no ordering difference can show. The claim here is the LIST and the
      *> mixed brace; the ordering sentence has no conforming witness (feedback_verdict_evidence_invariant).
      *>
      *> Format 7 is a COBOL-2002 introduction (constructs.json usage-pointer-2002 / SetAddress2002), which is
      *> why this lives at 2002; negative/pb450-set-address-second-operand-below-2002 pins the edge BELOW it at
      *> the second operand, and negative/pb450-set-format7-second-receiver-not-pointer pins SR17 there.
