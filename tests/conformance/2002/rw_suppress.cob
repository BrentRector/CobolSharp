      *> ISO §14.9.45 SUPPRESS statement. A USE BEFORE REPORTING procedure
      *> (§14.9.49 Format 2) on the detail group executes SUPPRESS PRINTING
      *> for the rows flagged hidden (WS-HIDE = 1). Per §14.9.45.4 GR3 the
      *> statement inhibits ONLY: (a) printing the group's lines, (b) any
      *> page advance, (c) NEXT GROUP, (d) LINE-COUNTER changes. It does
      *> NOT inhibit sum-counter accumulation (§13.18.54.4 GR7) nor the
      *> end-of-group sum reset (GR2) — only PRESENT WHEN / OCCURS DEPENDING
      *> absence skips the reset (GR10), which this program does not use.
      *> Proof: the amount of the SUPPRESSED middle row (20) never prints as
      *> a detail line, yet it STILL rolls into the group-1 control total, so
      *> the control footing prints TOTAL=060 (= 10 + 20 + 30), not 040.
      *> GR2 (current instance only) is exercised too: SUPPRESS is executed
      *> conditionally per GENERATE, so the surrounding shown rows print.
