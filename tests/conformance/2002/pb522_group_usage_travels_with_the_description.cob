      *> kb/Work PB522 — a data description COPY carries the GROUP-USAGE clause.
      *>
      *> THE RULE. ISO §13.18.57.4 GR1: the TYPE clause's effect "is as though the data description identified
      *> by type-name-1 had been coded in place of the TYPE clause, excluding the level-number, name, alignment,
      *> and the GLOBAL, SELECT WHEN, and TYPEDEF clauses specified for type-name-1". §13.18.49.4 GR1 is the same
      *> sentence for SAME AS, excluding only the level-number, name, CONSTANT RECORD, EXTERNAL, GLOBAL,
      *> REDEFINES and SELECT WHEN. Both state what is LEFT OUT, and GROUP-USAGE (§13.18.29) is in NEITHER list,
      *> so it travels — as §13.18.49.4 GR4, which propagates a GROUP-USAGE from data-name-1's SUPERORDINATE
      *> onto the subject, confirms. §13.18.58.4 GR1 reproduces a type declaration's subordinate entries whole,
      *> so a GROUP-USAGE clause written on a group NESTED inside a TYPEDEF travels too.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED — never measured. §8.5.2.5 item 3 / §8.5.2.10 item 3 make a group "explicitly
      *> or implicitly described with a GROUP-USAGE clause with the BIT [NATIONAL] phrase" of category boolean
      *> [national], and §15.50.4 then fixes the UNIT the LENGTH function counts in:
      *>   r1) a BIT GROUP item -> boolean positions;
      *>   r2) a NATIONAL GROUP item -> national character positions;
      *>   r3) anything else -> alphanumeric character positions.
      *> §13.16.4 GR1/GR2 imply the clause for every group SUBORDINATE to a bit / national group, so the inner
      *> groups answer in the same unit as their records. Hence:
      *>   a national group over PIC N(4)      = 4 national character positions;
      *>   a bit group over PIC 1(3) USAGE BIT = 3 boolean positions;
      *>   a bit group over PIC 1(5) USAGE BIT = 5 boolean positions;
      *>   the nested national group over PIC N(3) = 3 national character positions.
      *> Every record below is paired with a BYTE-IDENTICAL INLINE CONTROL, so the golden states the rule rather
      *> than a number: the copy shall measure exactly what its written-out spelling measures.
      *>
      *> §13.18.29.4 GR2b additionally treats a national group "as though it were an elementary data item of
      *> usage national and class and category national described with PICTURE N(m), where m is the length of the
      *> group" — so the whole group is ONE national operand. CMP= pins that: the copy is an elementary
      *> national operand exactly as its control is, which an alphanumeric group could not be.
      *>
      *> Before this fix BOTH copy helpers omitted GroupUsage, so every VIA- / SAME- record below bound as an
      *> ORDINARY alphanumeric group and the four lines read A=8 8 CTL=4 4 / B=1 1 CTL=3 3 / C=8 8 1 1 CTL=4 5
      *> / D=6 CTL=3 — every copy disagreeing with its own byte-identical control, with no diagnostic.
      *>
      *> COBOL-2002: GROUP-USAGE, TYPEDEF/TYPE and SAME AS are all 2002 introductions — the negative twin
      *> tests/conformance/negative/pb522-group-usage-copy-below-2002.cob pins the gate below it.
