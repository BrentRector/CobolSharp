      *> kb/Work PB716 - the CLASS clause's FOR phrase at its PRINTED position.  ISO 12.3.7.2 (rendered from the
      *> printed page, PDF p320 / folio 290) prints
      *>     CLASS class-name-1 [ FOR { ALPHANUMERIC | NATIONAL } ]
      *>         IS { literal-5 [ { THROUGH | THRU } literal-6 ] } ... [ IN alphabet-name-4 ]
      *> - the FOR group is on the CLASS line, BETWEEN class-name-1 and IS.  The grammar used to spell it AFTER
      *> the literals, so the printed form below was refused (COBOL0305 at FOR) and the unprinted
      *> `CLASS X IS "0" NATIONAL` compiled.  FOR is not underlined (8.3.2.4.3 - an optional word), so HEXU
      *> omits it.  The FOR phrase is a COBOL-2002 introduction (the national class entered with 2002), so
      *> this is the introducing edition; the negative below it is the version matrix's.
      *> Expected: "C" is in 0-9/A-F; "g" is not (12.3.7.4 GR12 - the class is exactly the listed characters).
