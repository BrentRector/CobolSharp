      *> Row pinned: FMT-12.4.4.2 (the ellipsis arm: more than one
      *> file-control-entry in one paragraph).
      *>  General format: "FILE-CONTROL. [ file-control-entry ] ..."
      *>  The ellipsis lets the bracketed entry repeat, so two SELECT
      *>  entries under one FILE-CONTROL header are legal and each
      *>  declares its own file (§12.4.5: "The file control entry
      *>  declares the relevant physical attributes of a file.").

      *> Derivation: each file is written with one record and read
