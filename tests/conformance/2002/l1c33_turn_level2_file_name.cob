      *> "With the exception of EC-I-O-WARNING, if exception-name-1 is
      *> one of the level-2 exception-names, the effect is as if that
      *> TURN directive were specified containing all exception-names
      *> that are subordinate to that level-2 exception-name. If
      *> file-name-1 is specified, the effect is as if file-name-1 were
      *> specified for each of these exception-names."
      *>   cite.py: OK  §7.3.25.4 3)  (General rules)
      *> Supporting: §9.1.13 - an I-O status '1x' is associated with
      *> EC-I-O-AT-END; §7.3.25.4 GR6 "if file-name-1 is specified,
      *> checking is enabled only for exception conditions associated
      *> with that file-name"; §14.6.13.1 - EXCEPTION-STATUS returns the
      *> last raised level-3 exception-name, spaces while none has been
      *> raised.
      *> DERIVATION. '>>TURN EC-I-O F1 CHECKING ON' is, by GR3, the same
      *> as naming every level-3 EC-I-O-* (among them EC-I-O-AT-END)
      *> each with F1.
      *>   READ F2 (empty) -> at end, status 10; checking is NOT on for
      *>     F2, so no exception is raised: "F2 AT END []" (EXCEPTION-
      *>     STATUS still spaces). An implementation dropping
      *>     file-name-1 would print EC-I-O-AT-END here.
      *>   READ F1 (empty) -> at end; EC-I-O-AT-END is enabled for F1 by
      *>     the level-2 expansion, so it is raised: "F1 AT END [EC-I-O-
      *>     AT-END]". An implementation not expanding the level-2 name
      *>     (or expanding it without the file-name) prints [] here.
