      *> kb/Work PB235 - ISO 14.9.6.4 GR9 against Table 14 symbol e. GR9
      *> carries NO "without the UNIT phrase" qualifier -
      *>   "Except when the file is specified in an APPLY COMMIT clause,
      *>    the file lock and any record locks associated with the file
      *>    connector referenced by file-name-1 are released by the
      *>    execution of the CLOSE statement."
      *> - so the question this golden settles is whether CLOSE ... UNIT
      *> releases them. DERIVED ANSWER: NO.
      *>
      *> 1. GR3's Table 14 gives CLOSE UNIT on a Non-unit physical file
      *>    the single symbol e, NOT symbol c ("Close file"). Symbol e on
      *>    non-unit media reads: "Execution of this statement is
      *>    considered successful. The file remains in the open mode, the
      *>    file position indicator is unchanged, the I-O status
      *>    indicator for the file connector is set to '07', and no other
      *>    action takes place." A lock release IS another action.
      *> 2. The same holds on the unit media GR2 (b)/(c) describe, where
      *>    symbol e performs a UNIT SWAP and the connector keeps reading
      *>    - a connector that released its own file lock mid-file would
      *>    arbitrate against nothing.
      *> 3. 9.1.16 states the record-lock half as "all record locks
      *>    established for a file are released by the execution of an
      *>    explicit or implicit CLOSE statement FOR THE FILE", and
      *>    Table 14's own vocabulary separates symbol c "Close file"
      *>    from symbol e "Close unit".
      *> So GR9's release rides symbol c, i.e. every CLOSE format except
      *> the two UNIT rows. The plain CLOSE below must release both locks
      *> and the CLOSE ... UNIT must release neither.
      *>
      *> GR9's APPLY COMMIT carve-out cannot be exercised: the commit and
      *> rollback module (Annex A.4.3) is not claimed - docs/CONFORMANCE.md
      *> 5 - so no program can name an APPLY COMMIT clause.
