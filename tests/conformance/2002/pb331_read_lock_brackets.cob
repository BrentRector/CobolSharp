      *> !! THE PRINTED READ FORMATS, WRITTEN AS THE STANDARD PRINTS THEM (kb/Work PB331).
      *> ISO 14.9.30.2 (PDF page 722, RENDERED) gives the READ lock options as TWO
      *> INDEPENDENT PLAIN BRACKETS followed by the KEY phrase:
      *>     [ ADVANCING ON LOCK | IGNORING LOCK | retry-phrase ]
      *>     [ WITH LOCK | WITH NO LOCK ]
      *>     [ KEY IS { data-name-1 | record-key-name-1 } ]      (Format 2 only)
      *> 5.2.1: "The words, phrases, clauses, punctuation, and operands in each general
      *> format shall be written in the compilation group in the sequence given in the
      *> general format", so this order is the CONFORMING one. Every READ below was a
      *> syntax error until PB331: the grammar had the KEY slot BEFORE the lock phrases.
      *> 5.2.6.1 makes a series of brackets "a unique combination of possibilities", so
      *> S1 legally selects from BOTH brackets at once; 5.2.6.2 makes each bracket at
      *> most one alternative (negative/pb331-read-two-from-one-lock-bracket).
      *> 5.2.3: ON is NOT underlined in ADVANCING ON LOCK on page 722, so S2's spelling
      *> without it is conforming too.
