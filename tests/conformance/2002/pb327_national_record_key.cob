      *> kb/Work PB327 - A NATIONAL RECORD KEY, and START's LENGTH in
      *> NATIONAL POSITIONS. 12.4.5.12.3 SR2 admits it: "Data-name-1
      *> and data-name-2 shall reference a data item of category
      *> alphanumeric or category NATIONAL within a record description
      *> entry associated with the file-name". 14.9.41.4 GR13 then
      *> fixes the LENGTH unit: "if data-name-1 or record-key-name-1
      *> is of class national, arithmetic-expression-1 is the number of
      *> national character positions" - so WITH LENGTH 2 is the first
      *> TWO NATIONAL POSITIONS, four bytes of the eight-byte key, and
      *> N"AB" positions on "ABBB", never on "AAAA" (which a two-BYTE
      *> reading would have matched first, its first two bytes being
      *> 00 41 exactly like the operand's). GR17e's comparison per
      *> 8.8.4.2.9 is satisfied by the byte compare: UTF-16BE pair
      *> order IS code-unit order over the repertoire 8.5.1.4 admits.
      *> GR14 - "If arithmetic-expression-1 does not evaluate to a
      *> positive nonzero integer that is less than or equal to the
      *> length of the associated key, the I-O status ... is set to
      *> '23', the invalid key condition exists" - is counted in the
      *> same unit: LENGTH 5 exceeds the key's FOUR national positions.
