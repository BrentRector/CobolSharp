      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §14.9.25.4 GR2 and GR3 — THE ZERO-LENGTH-LITERAL SUBSTITUTION (kb/Work PB425).
      *> GR2: "If literal-1 is an alphanumeric or national zero-length literal and the receiving operand is
      *> other than a dynamic-length elementary item, literal-1 is treated as if it were the figurative
      *> constant SPACE."  GR3: the same sentence for "a boolean zero-length literal" and ZERO.
      *> Every expected value below is COMPUTED FROM THE RULE, receiver by receiver:
      *>   GR2 (a plain "" and an N"" sender) is figurative SPACE, sized to the receiver by §8.3.3.6.4 GR2 and
      *>   then EDITED by §14.9.25.4 GR6 where the receiver edits, so PIC XX/XX shows "  /  " — the insertion
      *>   position takes its own character.  Against a BOOLEAN receiver the fill is the boolean character '0'
      *>   (determination D-B2, CONFORMANCE.md §3: Table 17 gives SPACE category boolean there while
      *>   §8.3.3.6.4 GR5 defines no boolean space, and §14.6.8.6 fills a boolean receiver "with zero fill").
      *>   GR3 (a B"" sender) is figurative ZERO, whose alphanumeric character value is '0' (§8.3.3.6.4 GR4;
      *>   Table 17 gives ZERO against an alphanumeric receiving operand the category alphanumeric), so
      *>   PIC X(3) is "000" and PIC XX/XX is "00/00" — NOT spaces.
      *> Each sender reaches only the receiver categories Table 16 (§14.9.25.3 SR10) admits for its own
      *> category: alphanumeric → all seven; national → boolean/national/numeric; boolean →
      *> alphanumeric(-edited)/boolean/national.  The zero-length literal keeps its OWN category for that
      *> screen — GR2/GR3 substitute a VALUE, not a written figurative constant — which is why B"" into a
      *> numeric receiver is a rejection (tests/conformance/negative/pb425-boolean-zero-length-to-numeric).
      *> Zero-length literals, the boolean and national literal forms, and PIC A/1/N receivers are all
      *> COBOL-2002 additions, so 2002 is the rule's introducing edition; the behaviour does not differ by
      *> edition above it.
