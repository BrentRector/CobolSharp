      *> What each line proves:
      *>   SAVED  — GR26: LC_ALL saves the CURRENT locale (root in every category) into P1; switching LC_COLLATE to ES
      *>            afterwards does not touch the snapshot ("nz" < "ñu" now).
      *>   BACK   — GR23a with identifier-10: LC_COLLATE TO P1 restores the saved root collation ("nz" > "ñu").
      *>   PART   — a saved locale is PER CATEGORY (a snapshot of a state): with LC_COLLATE=ES and LC_TIME=root saved
      *>            into P2, then everything reset to SYSTEM-DEFAULT, LC_COLLATE TO P2 brings back SPANISH collation
      *>            (the snapshot's LC_COLLATE), while LC_TIME TO P2 would bring back root — 14.6.6 r3 at restore time.
      *>   UDSAVE — GR27: USER-DEFAULT saves the USER DEFAULT (root under the harness pin) even while the current
      *>            LC_COLLATE is Spanish; restoring LC_COLLATE from it gives the root order.
      *>   GR22   — `SET LOCALE USER-DEFAULT TO P2` sets the user default FROM a saved locale (SR25 allows identifier-10):
      *>            a later LC_COLLATE TO USER-DEFAULT gives the snapshot's Spanish collation.
      *>   HANDLED/NULL/ADDR — GR21: "The content of the pointer data item referenced by identifier-10 shall reference
      *>            saved locale information; otherwise, the EC-LOCALE-INVALID-PTR exception condition is set to exist
      *>            and the SET statement is unsuccessful." Table 13 (14.6.13.1.6) makes it FATAL; with checking on
      *>            (>>TURN) the USE declarative observes it and RESUME AT NEXT STATEMENT continues. Two invalid
      *>            pointers are tried: NULL, and an ADDRESS OF pointer (a data address is not saved locale
      *>            information). Each time the state is UNCHANGED (Spanish collation survives), as GR21 requires.
