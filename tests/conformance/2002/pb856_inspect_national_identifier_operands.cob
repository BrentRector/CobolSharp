      *> kb/Work PB856 — ISO 14.9.22.3 SR2: "Identifier-3, ... , identifier-n shall reference an elementary item
      *> described implicitly or explicitly as usage display or national." The NATIONAL half of the rule was never
      *> written: a national identifier operand drew COBOLNET0847 quoting the rule that admits it. Every operand
      *> position reads the one predicate now, and each is exercised with a national identifier (SR4 keeps the
      *> whole operand set national, so identifier-1 is national too). Expected values by 14.9.22.4:
      *>   TALLYING FOR ALL NA over "ABABA"                  -> 3   (GR12 a: one per match)
      *>   TALLYING FOR CHARACTERS BEFORE INITIAL NB         -> 1   (GR8 e, bounded by BEFORE: only "A")
      *>   REPLACING ALL NA BY NB                            -> BBBBB
      *>   CONVERTING NA TO NZ                               -> ZBZBZ
