      *> DA1 (CONFORMANCE-FIX-QUEUE, discovered during CA3): a HEXADECIMAL-format literal (X"hh", ISO §8.3.3.2 — each
      *> hex-digit pair is one character) in an ALPHABET clause is decoded to its character value, so a THRU range over
      *> hex literals assigns positions per §12.3.7.4 GR5. ALPHABET AL IS X"5A" THRU X"41" is the DESCENDING native run
      *> Z(X"5A")..A(X"41"), assigned ascending positions 1..26 — so LOW-VALUE (lowest position) = 'Z' (§8.3.3.6.4 GR7)
      *> and 'A' (position 26) collates ABOVE 'Z' (position 1) (§8.8.4.2.7). Pre-fix a hex literal fell through to raw
      *> text, its length != 1 skipped the THRU range, and the alphabet was silently left NATIVE (LOW-VALUE = X"00",
      *> 'A' < 'Z') — the DA1 defect. A char-literal THRU ("Z" THRU "A") always worked; only hex decode was missing.
