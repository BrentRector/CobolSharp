      *> and was swallowed by the 13.16.2 vendor-extension catch-all, so it was ACCEPTED and INERT: the bit
      *> group below occupied ONE byte with or without it.  Every value here is derived from the standard.

      *> 13.18.1.4 GR1: "An ALIGNED clause causes the subject of the entry to be aligned on the first bit of
      *> the first available byte boundary.  Implicit filler bits may be generated to complete the assignment
      *> of bits as described in 8.5.1.6.3."
      *> 13.18.1.4 GR2: "An ALIGNED clause specified for a multiple-occurrence data item applies to each
      *> occurrence of that item."
      *> 8.5.1.6.3, rule 1: without ALIGNED, "an elementary bit data item immediately following an elementary
      *> bit data item ... of the same level" is placed "at the next bit position in storage"; rule 4: a
      *> trailing bit item in an alphanumeric group is padded "to fill an integral number of characters".
      *> 15.50.4 r9: FUNCTION LENGTH rounds a non-integral occupancy "to the next larger integer value".

      *>   ALIGNED  B1 bits 0-3; B2 takes GR1's next byte      -> bits 8-11; extent 12 bits,
      *>            rule 4 pads to 16                                                    -> LENGTH 2

      *>            extent 20 bits, rule 4 pads to 24                                    -> LENGTH 3
      *>   NOTABLE  the same table without ALIGNED: 12 contiguous bits, padded to 16      -> LENGTH 2
      *> The stored values re-read per occurrence prove the OFFSET walk agrees with the EXTENT walk - the two

      *> sized right and addressed wrong.
