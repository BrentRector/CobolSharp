      *>     regardless of SR2, so
      *>          >>IF V = 2 keeps the first branch (V = 1 would print A
      *>            V=1).
      *>   B V=1  "AS 1 OVERRIDE" sets V back to 1; >>IF V = 1 keeps its
      *>     branch.
      *>   C V=1  a plain "DEFINE V AS 1" (no OVERRIDE) is legal only
      *>     because the LAST
      *>          previous DEFINE of V (the override) specified the
      *>            value 1 (SR2 third
      *>          arm); the program compiles and V is still 1.
      *>   D W=5  W is the alphanumeric "X"; "AS 5 OVERRIDE" rebinds it
      *>     unconditionally,
      *>          even to a numeric literal, so >>IF W = 5 (a numeric
      *>            relation, legal
      *>          only because W is now numeric) keeps its branch.
