      *> ISO §13.10 constant entries (2002). A constant is a COMPILE-TIME
      *> substitution: §13.10.4 GR1/GR3 — references are "as if [the]
      *> literal were written where constant-name-1 is written"; the
      *> entry occupies NO storage. AS forms covered: a literal (GR1/GR2
      *> — incl. the §13.10.3 SR1 reclassification, so AS 0.25 keeps its
      *> non-integer value, and a §8.8.3 concatenation, which folds
      *> first per §8.8.3.3 GR3); an arithmetic expression (GR4 —
      *> §7.3.6 compile-time arithmetic, result truncated to an
      *> integer), including a PRIOR constant as an operand (§13.10.3
      *> SR2/SR7); and LENGTH OF (GR6 — the §15.50 LENGTH value).
      *> Substitution positions exercised: an OCCURS bound + a PICTURE
      *> repetition count (§13.10.3 SR2), VALUE clauses (01 and
      *> level-88), a subscript, MOVE/DISPLAY operands, arithmetic, and
      *> relation conditions. §13.10.3 SR9: a duplicated constant-name
      *> with the SAME specification is legal.
