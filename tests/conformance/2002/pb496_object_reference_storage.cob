      *> data item is implementor-defined and is not necessarily the same for every object

      *> COBOL.NET's determination is docs/CONFORMANCE.md item DOC-A.1-214: an object
      *> reference IS one .NET managed reference, so every shape of the §13.18.60.2 general

      *> 64-bit runtime this compiler targets.  This golden is that determination's witness.

      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE DETERMINATION — NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>   U=00008   the universal object reference (GR22 b))
      *>   T=00008   an object-class-name reference (GR22 d)1.b.)
      *>   O=00008   the same with the ONLY phrase (GR22 d)2.b.)
      *>   F=00008   a FACTORY OF reference (GR22 d)1.a.)
      *>   I=00008   an interface-name reference (GR22 c))
      *> DISCRIMINATOR: GR22 a) expressly permits these to DIFFER, so five equal numbers is a
      *> determination and not a tautology — an implementation carrying a fat pointer for the
      *> universal shape and a thin one for the typed shapes conforms too, and answers
      *> differently here.
