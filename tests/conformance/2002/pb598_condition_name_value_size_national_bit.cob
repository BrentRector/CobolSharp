      *> ISO 13.18.63.3 SR5 (national) and SR10 (boolean) - each the
      *> SAME sentence pair as SR4's, over national and over boolean
      *> positions: "National literals in the VALUE clause of AN
      *> ELEMENTARY ITEM shall not exceed the size indicated by AN
      *> EXPLICIT PICTURE clause.  National literals in the VALUE clause
      *> of a national group item shall not exceed the size of the group
      *> item."  SR10 is written for boolean and reaches the
      *> condition-name format through SR24, "Syntax rules 10 and 17
      *> above apply".
      *>
      *> THE OTHER TWO ARMS of kb/Work PB598.  SR5 is an ALL FORMATS
      *> rule and SR10 is imported WHOLE by SR24, so both bind a
      *> Format-3 entry - but their SIZE sentences name only an
      *> elementary item and a group item, and a condition-name is
      *> neither (13.16.2's Format 3 admits no PICTURE clause; SR33
      *> makes the level-88 entry the subject; 8.5.1.3.2 item 3 gives it
      *> no concept of level; 13.18.63.4 GR19 gives it its conditional
      *> variable's characteristics only IMPLICITLY, which is what
      *> "explicit" excludes).  Measured before this fix: both were
      *> COBOLNET0898, legal source rejected - and unlike the
      *> alphanumeric arm these two had been wrong since they were
      *> written, which is why no differential case caught them (0 of
      *> 1,611 GnuCOBOL corpus members carries an oversize national or
      *> boolean level-88 literal).
      *>
      *> The CLASS half of the same rules is untouched and still binds a
      *> condition-name: N1/B1 below take only their own literal forms,
      *> which negative fixtures pin.
      *>
      *> Derived expectations:
      *> N1  NV = N"AB"; NC is N"ABC"; 8.8.4.5.3 item 2 -> relation
      *>     rules -> 8.8.4.2.9 (national operands, standard comparison
      *>     absent a locale-based national collating sequence) ->
      *>     8.8.4.2.10 item 2, "the shorter operand were extended on
      *>     the right by sufficient national spaces", so N"AB " differs
      *>     from N"ABC" at position 3 -> FALSE.
      *> N2  SET NC TO TRUE -> 14.9.39.4 GR6 -> 13.18.63.4 GR7 ->
      *>     14.6.8.5 truncation to the right -> NV = N"AB", and NC is
      *>     still FALSE.
      *> B1  BV = B"10"; BC is B"101"; 8.8.4.2.8 item 2 extends the
      *>     shorter operand "on the right by sufficient boolean zeros"
      *>     - NOT spaces; there is no boolean space - so B"100" differs
      *>     from B"101" at position 3 -> FALSE.  This is the arm a
      *>     screen that borrowed the alphanumeric rule would get wrong.
      *> B2  SET BC TO TRUE truncates B"101" into two boolean positions
      *>     -> BV = B"10" (displayed "10"), and BC is still FALSE.
      *> B3  The BOUNDARY: DC is B"10" over two positions -> TRUE.
      *>
      *> National data and boolean data are COBOL-2002 introductions
      *> (COBOLNET0900 below that), which is why this half of PB598's
      *> proof lives at 2002 and not at 85.
