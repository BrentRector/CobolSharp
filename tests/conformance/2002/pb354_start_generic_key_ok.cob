      *> ISO 1989:2023 §14.9.41.3 SR6 — the COMPLEMENT of the screen
      *> kb/Work PB354 tightened. SR6 admits data-name-1 that is
      *>   a) "A data item specified as a prime or alternate record key
      *>      associated with file-name-1", or
      *>   b) a data item whose "leftmost character position within a
      *>      record of the file corresponds to the leftmost character
      *>      position of a prime or alternate record key" (b 1.), that
      *>      "has the same class, category, and usage as that record
      *>      key" (b 2.) and whose "length is not greater than the
      *>      length of that record key" (b 3.).
      *> A screen is evidence about what it RETURNED, never about what
      *> it dropped, so every accepting shape is walked here:
      *>   K1  the declared prime key itself                  (SR6 a)
      *>   K2  an item at the prime key's identical BYTE
      *>       POSITIONS in a SECOND record description —
      *>       §12.4.5.12.4 GR4 makes those positions
      *>       "implicitly referenced as keys for all other
      *>       record description entries"                    (SR6 a)
      *>   K3  a SHORTER same-class/category/usage item at the
      *>       prime key's leftmost position: a generic key,
      *>       which compares on its own length              (SR6 b)
      *>   K4  the declared alternate key itself              (SR6 a)
      *>   K5  a shorter generic key over the ALTERNATE key   (SR6 b)
      *> The three records are keyed AAAAAA / AABBBB / BBBBBB with
      *> alternate keys AA01 / AA02 / BB01, so a 3-character generic
      *> prime key "AAB" selects the SECOND record (not the first,
      *> which "AAA" would) and a 2-character generic alternate "BB"
      *> selects the third — each answer is unreachable by accident.
      *> §14.9.30.4 GR21 (sequential arm b) makes the START-selected
      *> record the one the following READ NEXT delivers.
