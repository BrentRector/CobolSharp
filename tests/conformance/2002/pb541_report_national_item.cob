      *> ⛔ A REPORT GROUP ITEM MAY BE NATIONAL, AND A USAGE CLAUSE ON A REPORT GROUP ENTRY IS NOT SCENERY
      *> (kb/Work PB541). ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §13.18.60.3 SR7 names TWO admitted phrases: "Only the DISPLAY or
      *> NATIONAL phrase may be specified in any USAGE clause associated with a report group item." The gate
      *> this golden replaces tested `usage is not DISPLAY` — one alternative narrower than the rule — so every
      *> NATIONAL report item was refused at 2002, 2014 and 2023 under a §13.15 citation that says nothing of
      *> the kind (the nearest real text, §13.18.14.4 GR3, is about the column/character correspondence).
      *>
      *> THREE WAYS AN ENTRY ARRIVES AT ITS USAGE, and SR7 admits all three here:
      *>
      *> LINE 1 — the entry's OWN clause. `USAGE NATIONAL` written on the printable entry itself, beside a
      *>   plain DISPLAY entry on the same line: SR7's two alternatives, coexisting. The national item's image
      *>   occupies one COLUMN per character — §13.18.14.4 GR9 advances the horizontal counter by the item's
      *>   size — so WXYZ fills columns 1-4 and the DISPLAY item at COLUMN 6 lands after one blank column.
      *>
      *> LINE 2 — INHERITED from the group entry above it. §13.18.60.4 GR1: "If the USAGE clause is specified
      *>   or implied at a group level, it applies only to each elementary item in the group." The 03 entry
      *>   carries USAGE NATIONAL and prints nothing itself; its subordinate 05 has no USAGE clause and is a
      *>   national item because of GR1. Before this, a USAGE clause on a report GROUP entry was captured and
      *>   then silently DISCARDED — `03 USAGE COMP.` over a printable item compiled and ran, which is the
      *>   complement pinned by conformance:negative/pb541-report-usage-comp.
      *>
      *> LINE 3 — IMPLIED by the picture character-string. §13.18.60.4 GR8 speaks of "the implicit or explicit
      *>   USAGE NATIONAL clause", and §13.18.40.3 makes a picture of all N symbols a national item, so this
      *>   entry is national with no USAGE clause anywhere. It is the arm a screen written over the USAGE
      *>   CLAUSE alone would miss, which is why the rule is asked once more of the usage the entry settles on.
      *>
      *> EDITION. National data is a COBOL-2002 introduction (§8.5.2 category national), so 2002 is the
      *> introducing edition for a NATIONAL report item and conformance:negative/pb541-report-national-at-85
      *> is the negative below it. The behaviour does not differ across 2002/2014/2023, so there is one copy.
      *>
      *> THE READ-BACK IS BYTE-WISE because ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL is gated at 2023 in this compiler; a
      *> one-character record on a second SELECT over the same file reassembles each line at any edition. The
      *> national characters here are all in the 7-bit range on purpose: the print stream maps a character
      *> above it to '?' (SequentialConnector.PrintSafe, the implementor-defined print encoding the NIST golden
      *> corpus pins), which is a separate question from the one SR7 answers.
