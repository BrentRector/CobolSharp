      *> ISO 8.8.4.4.2's class-condition general format prints FOURTEEN alternatives and BOOLEAN is one of
      *> them (verified on the PRINTED page - PDF 224 / printed 194: every keyword alternative underlined,
      *> alphabet-name-1 and class-name-1 not, no choice indicator). 8.8.4.4.4 GR3 e) gives it its truth
      *> value: "If BOOLEAN is specified, the condition is true if the content of the data item referenced
      *> by identifier-1 consists entirely of the boolean values '0' and '1'."
      *>
      *> It was UNIMPLEMENTED (kb/Work PB590): the class-condition grammar offered no BOOLEAN alternative,
      *> so the word fell into the relation condition's identifier slot and drew COBOLNET0901 ("'BOOLEAN' is
      *> a reserved word ... cannot be used as a user-defined word") on conforming source.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, FROM THE RULE AND NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>   A - BB holds B"1010", four boolean positions, every one '0' or '1'  => TRUE.
      *>   B - XA is PIC X(4) VALUE "0101". GR3 e) asks about the CONTENT, not the category; 8.8.4.4.3 SR5
      *>       bars only a numeric or numeric-edited operand and SR3 asks only for usage display or
      *>       national, so an alphanumeric item whose four characters are '0'/'1' answers TRUE.
      *>   C - XB is "01X1": position 3 is neither '0' nor '1'                 => FALSE.
      *>   D - the same test with NOT (8.8.4.4.4 GR2, "the truth value is reversed") => TRUE.
      *>   E - the EVALUATE selection subject's own class test (14.9.13.4 GR3 e) names condition-1) is the
      *>       SAME 8.8.4.4 class condition. It used to be parsed by a private second alternative list that
      *>       had no BOOLEAN arm at all; one list, one binder body, so this line answers as line B does.
      *>   F - a SPECIAL-NAMES class-name as an EVALUATE subject's class test (8.8.4.4.4 GR3 f) - the same
      *>       extraction: that private list had no user-defined-word alternative either, so this spelling
      *>       did not parse while the IF spelling did.
