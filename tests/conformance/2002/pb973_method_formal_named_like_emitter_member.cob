      *> kb/Work PB973 - a METHOD formal parameter may carry ANY user-
      *> defined word as its data-name. ISO 8.3.2.2: "Within a source
      *> element, a given user-defined word may be used as only one type
      *> of user-defined word" - N, V, INV and PROP are each used only as
      *> a data-name here, so every one is legal. They are also the
      *> spellings of the compiler's own generated members (__N the
      *> paragraph count, __V, __INV, __PROP): the formal's C# carrier
      *> once shared that namespace, and a formal named N crashed the
      *> backend (CS1628) on this legal source.
      *> Expected values, from the rules:
      *> 14.2.3 GR8 - "If the argument is passed by reference, the
      *> activated runtime element operates as if the formal parameter
      *> occupies the same storage area as the argument": SETN's ADD 1 TO N
      *> is W's, so W = 7 + 1 = 008 after the call; MIX's MOVE TO PROP is
      *> C's.
      *> TOTAL: SETN 7; ADDV +8 (W's value at the call) = 15; MIX + INV
      *> (2) + PROP (3) = 20, then MOVE TOTAL TO PROP makes C = 020.
