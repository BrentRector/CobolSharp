      *> kb/Work PB577 — ISO 13.18.63.4 GR6 and GR9 at the OTHER occasion the VALUE clause takes effect on:
      *> GR4c's second bullet, "during the execution of an INITIALIZE statement". Before kb/Work PB393 this whole
      *> surface ABORTED - `INITIALIZE <group containing an occurs-depending table>` reached a runtime
      *> NotImplementedCobolFeatureException at all four editions - so no golden could exist; the sibling
      *> conformance:85/pb577_odo_value_initial_state carries GR4c's FIRST bullet. The TO VALUE phrase is
      *> COBOL-2002 (the edition floor is witnessed by conformance:negative/pb420-initialize-float-to-value-85).
      *> Every expected value below is derived from the rules, not measured:
      *>   L1 GR9, "causes EVERY occurrence of the associated data item to be assigned the specified value", at
      *>      this occasion: N1 is OUTSIDE S1 and holds 2, so 14.9.20.4 GR8 ("the number of occurrences
      *>      initialized is determined by the rules of the OCCURS clause for a receiving data item") reaches
      *>      13.18.38.4 GR8a, "only that part of the table area that is specified by the value of the data item
      *>      referenced by data-name-1 AT THE START OF THE OPERATION will be used" - occurrences 1 and 2.
      *>   L2 ⚖ DETERMINATION D-ODO1 (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §3): the same statement leaves occurrence 5 untouched.
      *>      13.18.63.4 GR6's maximum-pretence governs the occasions on which no statement supplies a count;
      *>      14.9.20.4 GR8 is the more specific rule for how many occurrences an INITIALIZE statement
      *>      initializes, and it is the one that answers here. T1(5) therefore keeps the dirtying MOVE's ZZ.
      *>   L3 The OTHER quadrant of 13.18.38.4 GR8: N2 is INSIDE S2, and S2 is a receiving operand, so GR8b's
      *>      "If the group is a receiving operand, the maximum length of the group will be used" gives all five
      *>      occurrences - and GR6's last sentence, "If a VALUE clause is associated with the data item
      *>      referenced by a DEPENDING phrase, that value is considered to be placed in the data item AFTER the
      *>      occurs-depending table is initialized", is why N2 reads 2 while the table beside it carries five.
      *>      Reading N2 BEFORE it is re-raised is what makes this a witness of the order rather than a DERIVATION.
      *>   L4 GR6 case c, "a data item that is subordinate to an occurs-depending table", at this occasion.
      *>   L5 GR9's SECOND named arm, "an entry that is SUBORDINATE to an OCCURS clause", at this occasion -
      *>      the arm conformance:2002/table_value_occurs cannot reach, because all three of its elements carry
      *>      their own OCCURS clause. Every occurrence, not just the first.
