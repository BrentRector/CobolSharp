      *> kb/Work PB415 — ISO §14.9.20.4 GR1, SECOND SENTENCE: "When identifier-2 references a bit group item or
      *> a national group item, identifier-2 is processed as an elementary data item."
      *>
      *> ⛔ THIS SENTENCE WAS UNREACHABLE, NOT UNIMPLEMENTED. §14.9.20.3 SR4 admits identifier-2 only where a
      *> MOVE (or SET) from it to an item of the named category would be valid, so a NATIONAL GROUP sender needs
      *> the category-name NATIONAL — and NATIONAL was one of the eight of §14.9.20.2's thirteen category names
      *> the grammar could not spell. With the words landed the rule can be measured for the first time.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED, DERIVED BEFORE THE RUN:
      *>   NG is `GROUP-USAGE NATIONAL` with two national children holding N"ab" and N"cde" — five national
      *>   character positions in total. GR1 sentence 2 makes it ONE elementary national sending item, so the
      *>   implicit MOVE of §14.9.20.4 GR4 moves all five positions into N1 (PIC N(5)) → "abcde". A1 is category
      *>   alphanumeric, names no category in the phrase, and GR5c therefore leaves it at "xyz".
      *>   (GR1 sentence 1 — identifier-1 as a bit/national GROUP is processed as a GROUP — is pinned elsewhere;
      *>   this file is the sentence-2 witness.)
