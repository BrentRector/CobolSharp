      *> kb/Work PB391 (second half). ISO 1989:2023 14.7.6 rule 2 - "In a MOVE statement, at least one of the
      *> data items is an elementary data item and the resulting move is valid according to the rules for the
      *> MOVE statement" - sends the CORRESPONDING pairing decision to the WHOLE of the MOVE statement's
      *> validity, not to 14.9.25.3 table 16 alone. 14.9.25.3 SR10, the rule that routes to the table, governs
      *> only "all other cases not described in Syntax rules 8 and 9", so SR8 is asked FIRST:
      *>
      *>   SR8 - "If identifier-1 references a data item described with usage binary-char, binary-short,
      *>          binary-long, or binary-double, identifier-2 shall reference a numeric or numeric-edited item."
      *>
      *> COBOL-2002 is SR8's introducing edition: the BINARY-CHAR / -SHORT / -LONG / -DOUBLE usages are a 2002
      *> addition to 13.18.60, so no COBOL-85 program can state this rule at all.
      *>
      *> The four namesake pairs read the rule directly. KX and KN have receivers that are neither numeric nor
      *> numeric-edited, so the pairs do NOT correspond and the receivers keep their prior content - a refused
      *> pair is a SILENT non-selection under rule 2, never a diagnostic. KD and KE have a numeric and a
      *> numeric-edited receiver, the two the rule names, so those pairs DO correspond and move. MM is the
      *> control proving the statement ran at all.
      *>
      *> Before PB391 the filter asked only table 16, where a BINARY-LONG item is an ordinary Numeric/Integer
      *> row member: KX paired and read 00000 over ZZZZZ, and KN paired and read the digits over its national
      *> receiver - while the SAME compiler refused the written MOVE of those very two items with COBOLNET0819
      *> (negative/pb391-move-binary-long-to-alphanumeric-written). One rule, two answers.
