       PROGRAM-ID. PB669V.
      *> kb/Work PB669. A locked record is inaccessible to EVERY other
      *> file connector, not only to the ones that declared a posture.
      *> ISO 9.1.16: "While locked by a given file connector, a record
      *> is not accessible to another file connector in the same or a
      *> different run unit, except by the execution of a READ statement
      *> with the IGNORING LOCK phrase." The sentence carries NO
      *> qualification on the reading connector's own LOCK MODE clause,
      *> and 12.4.5.9.4 GR1 a) / b) 1. are worded to say only that no
      *> record locks are SET through such a connector. F-B below has
      *> neither a SHARING clause nor a LOCK MODE clause, so it is
      *> 12.4.5.9.4 GR1 b) 2.'s implementor-defined case; this compiler
      *> defines the default as NO RECORD LOCKING - the third option the
      *> rule itself names - which decides what F-B SETS and nothing
      *> about what it SEES.
      *>
      *> Before PB669 every governed verb in FileRegistry returned to
      *> the UNGOVERNED body when the connector was absent from the
      *> opt-in posture map, so READB, REWB and DELB below all answered
      *> '00' and DELB actually REMOVED a record another connector held
      *> locked. The same opt-in-overlay shape PB321 removed from OPEN.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, COMPUTED FROM THE RULES:
      *>   READB  '51' - 14.9.30.4 GR9 with no RETRY phrase is the
      *>          record operation conflict condition (9.1.13.8 item 1).
      *>          Only the STATUS is displayed: GR10 c) makes the record
      *>          area's content undefined after the conflict.
      *>   IGNB   '00' ALPHA - 14.9.30.4 GR12, "the requested record is
      *>          made available, even if it is locked". The phrase is
      *>          admissible because F-B's effective LOCK MODE is not
      *>          AUTOMATIC (14.9.30.3 SR4).
      *>   REWB   '51' - 14.9.35.4 GR11, "the record identified for
      *>          rewriting is locked by another file connector"; GR14
      *>          then leaves the record and the record area unaffected.
      *>   DELB   '51' - 14.9.10.4 GR6, "the record identified for
      *>          deletion is locked by another file connector".
      *>   READB2 '00' - GR9 names the record IDENTIFIED for access, so
      *>          an unlocked record of the same physical file is
      *>          unaffected; record 2 is not locked.
      *>   READA2 '00' - the REVERSE direction. F-B sets no lock at all
      *>          (12.4.5.9.4 GR1 b) 2., above), so the MANUAL connector
      *>          reads the record F-B just read with no conflict.
      *>   AFTER  '00' ALPHA - 14.9.47 GR1: UNLOCK releases every record
      *>          lock F-A holds, and record 1 is available again with
      *>          the content REWB failed to replace.
