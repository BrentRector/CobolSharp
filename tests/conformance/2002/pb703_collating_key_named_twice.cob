      *> ISO §12.4.5.7.2 Format 2 (key-level) COLLATING SEQUENCE: the general format is
      *> `COLLATING SEQUENCE OF { data-name-1 | record-key-name-1 } … IS alphabet-name-3`,
      *> and by §5.2.7 ("the ellipsis applies to the portion of the format between the
      *> determined pair of delimiters") the `…` repeats the BRACE GROUP — so ONE clause
      *> may list one or more names, the same name among them. §12.4.5.7.3 SR8 forbids a
      *> name only "in more than one COLLATING SEQUENCE clause", and one clause is never
      *> more than one, so `OF IX-KEY IX-KEY IS REV` is legal (kb/Work PB703 — it was
      *> rejected COBOLNET1582 by a duplicate screen hoisted out of the clause loop).

      *> Expected values, derived: §12.4.5.7.4 GR6 — "Alphabet-name-3 applies to record
      *> keys identified by data-name-1 or record-key-name-1" — gives IX-KEY the REV
      *> sequence and IX-ALT the DREV sequence, and §12.4.5.5.3 GR2 c) makes sequential
      *> retrieval "ascending within a given key of reference according to the collating
      *> sequence for that key".
      *>   REV  = "ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA": weights Z=0 < M=13 < A=25, so the prime
      *>          key ascends Z, M, A (records written A/3, M/1, Z/2 → alts 2, 1, 3).
      *>   DREV = "9876543210": weights '3'=6 < '2'=7 < '1'=8, so the alternate key
      *>          ascends 3, 2, 1 (keys A, Z, M) and START KEY >= "3" (weight 6, the
      *>          lowest of the three) positions on the first of them.
      *> Native ordinal weights would print A, M, Z and 1, 2, 3 — the two halves order
      *> DIFFERENTLY, so neither can pass with the other's sequence applied.
