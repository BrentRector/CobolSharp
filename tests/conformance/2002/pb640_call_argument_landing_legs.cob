      *> kb/Work PB640 - the SCOPE of the activating-side landing: ISO 14.2.3 GR9 splits the
      *> argument crossing three ways, and only ONE of them is the COMPUTE the landing performs.
      *>
      *>   "The argument is used as the sending operand and the allocated record as the receiving
      *>    operand in the following:
      *>      - if the formal parameter is numeric, a COMPUTE statement without the ROUNDED phrase
      *>      - if the formal parameter is of class index, object, or pointer, a SET statement
      *>      - otherwise, a MOVE statement."
      *>
      *> and that whole list applies only to GR9's SECOND branch (a prototyped program, an AS
      *> NESTED CALL, a method, a function). GR9's FIRST branch - "a program for which there is no
      *> program-specifier in the REPOSITORY paragraph of the activating runtime element and there
      *> is no NESTED phrase specified on the CALL statement" - allocates a record "of the same
      *> length as the argument" and "that argument is moved to this allocated record without
      *> conversion". 14.8.2.3.3 draws the same partition for conformance (rule 1 vs rule 2).
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED:
      *>  NOCONV - GR9 FIRST branch: PIC 9(4) = 1234 to a PIC 9(4) formal, no conversion => 1234.
      *>  IDXLEG - GR9's SET leg. An index data item is class INDEX (8.5.2.1 Table 2), NOT numeric,
      *>    so the crossing is a SET and "SET copies the occurrence number unchanged". IX is 3, so
      *>    the callee's TE (TI) is the third 2-character element of "ABCDEFGHIJ" => EF. This row
      *>    is the trap the landing's guard exists for: an index item's storage description carries
      *>    category Numeric with ZERO digit positions, so a numeric landing would store
      *>    value % 10**0 = 0 and this row would read the FIRST element's storage, not the third.
      *>  ANYLEN - GR9's ANY LENGTH bullet: the allocated record is "a data item of the same
      *>    category, usage, and length as the ARGUMENT", so n follows the argument => 7 then 3.
      *>  DYNLEN - (2014 and later only: the DYNAMIC LENGTH clause is a COBOL-2014 introduction,
      *>    so the 2002 copy of this golden carries every other leg and not this one.)
      *>    GR9's DYNAMIC LENGTH bullet: "a dynamic-length elementary item ... described
      *>    with the same dynamic-length-structure-name as the formal parameter" with the argument
      *>    moved into it => length 5, HELLO.
      *>  MOVELEG - GR9's "otherwise, a MOVE statement": X(7) "ABCDEFG" into an X(4) formal is
      *>    14.9.25.4 GR6 b)'s alphanumeric move, left-justified with truncation on the right
      *>    => ABCD.
