      *> ISO 13.18.29.4 GR2b - "a national group is treated as though
      *> it were an elementary data item of usage national and class and
      *> category national" - and GR1b, its bit-group twin.  8.8.4.5.3
      *> GR2 makes a condition-name test compare "by the rules ...
      *> specified for relation conditions", so 8.8.4.2.9 orders a
      *> national conditional variable under the NATIONAL program
      *> collating sequence and 8.8.4.2.8 compares a boolean one by
      *> value with boolean-zero extension - never the alphanumeric one.
      *> 14.7.8 rule 2 - "When the range of values is defined by
      *> alphanumeric or national literals, the range of values depends
      *> on the collating sequence used for evaluation of the range" -
      *> makes the THROUGH leg decide on the sequence, not merely carry
      *> it.  kb/Work PB728: the level-88 renderer read the item's own
      *> PICTURE instead of its OPERAND picture, and a GROUP has none,
      *> so a GROUP-USAGE NATIONAL conditional variable was weighed by
      *> the ALPHANUMERIC sequence over a national image while the
      *> identical elementary 88 was weighed correctly.
      *>
      *> The two alphabets are declared with OPPOSITE orders so no leg
      *> can pass for the wrong reason (12.3.6.4 GR9/GR10 install both;
      *> 12.3.7.4 GR7 puts every unlisted character above both blocks).
      *>   REV-AN  "CBA"   -> alphanumeric  C(0) < B(1) < A(2)

      *>
      *> Every expected value is DERIVED, not measured.
      *>  V01 THE DISCRIMINATOR.  GN is a national GROUP holding N"CCC";
      *>      its 88 range is N"AAA" THRU N"CCC".  Under REV-NAT that is
      *>      an ascending range whose upper bound GN equals -> Y.  Under
      *>      REV-AN the same two literals are INVERTED (A is 2, C is 0),
      *>      so the range is empty and the answer would be N.  Before
      *>      PB728/PB741 the compiler emitted __COLLATE here and
      *>      answered N.
      *>  V02 THE AGREEMENT THIS PAIR EXISTS TO ASSERT: the identical
      *>      bounds written as a RELATION over a national ELEMENTARY
      *>      item holding N"CCC".  8.8.4.5.3 GR2 says the two are the
      *>      same comparison, so they must answer alike -> Y.
      *>  V03 THE OVER-FIX GUARD.  An ordinary ALPHANUMERIC group must
      *>      stay on the ALPHANUMERIC sequence (8.8.4.2.1 - "an
      *>      alphanumeric group item shall be treated as an elementary
      *>      alphanumeric data item").  AG holds "CCC" and its range is
      *>      "AAA" THRU "CCC": under REV-AN that range is inverted and
      *>      therefore empty -> N.  A fix that moved this group to the
      *>      national sequence would answer Y.
      *>  V04 the alphanumeric ELEMENTARY twin of V03 -> N.
      *>  V05 the BOOLEAN group: 8.8.4.2.8 compares boolean values
      *>      "regardless of their usage" and rule 2 extends the shorter
      *>      operand "on the right by sufficient boolean zeros", so no
      *>      collating sequence applies at all and B"101" equals
      *>      B"101" -> Y.  A no-regression guard for the pad arm: it is
      *>      TRUE under any sequence, and its value is the EMITTED
      *>      form (pad '0', no collate argument).
