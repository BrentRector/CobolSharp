      *> kb/Work PB1018 - the Format-2 table SORT (ISO 14.9.40, COBOL
      *> 2002) resolves every name it is given with its qualifiers:
      *>  - no KEY phrase: the table's own OCCURS KEY IS K OF B (GR21),
      *>  - a written key K OF B / K OF A (SR14 a, 8.4.2.2.3 SR1),
      *>  - the subject data-name-2 E OF G2 (SR13) - E is also in G1.
      *> Each used to take the FIRST same-named item. Elements are
      *> (A.K,B.K) = (7,3) (8,1) (9,2); T displays A.K B.K per element.
