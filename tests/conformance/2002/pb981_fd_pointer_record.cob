      *> kb/Work PB981 - determination D-FRA (docs/CONFORMANCE.md section 3): a level-1 POINTER record is
      *> legal in the file section (ISO 13.18.60.3 SR14 - "only for an elementary data item at level 1")
      *> and ISO 13.18.33.4 GR3 makes it an implicit redefinition of the FD's area. A pointer has no
      *> character image (CONFORMANCE.md A.1 item 216), so it is an OUT-OF-LINE record: a READ does not
      *> reach it (its value is unchanged), and a WRITE of it sends the zero-length record.

      *>   record 2 : the zero-length image fitted to the fixed record size - R2 is spaces
      *> This used to be refused (COBOLNET1697, a REDEFINES rule the source never invoked, then COBOLNET0899).
