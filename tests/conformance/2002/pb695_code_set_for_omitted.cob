      *> ISO 13.18.13.2, read off the printed page (PDF p414 / folio 384). The whole general format
      *> carries exactly THREE underlines - CODE-SET, ALPHANUMERIC and NATIONAL. FOR and IS are printed
      *> plain, so 8.3.2.4.3 ("uppercase words that are not underlined are called optional words and may
      *> be specified at the user's option with no effect on the semantics of the format") makes every
      *> spelling below conforming source. COBOL.NET required the FOR and answered COBOL0001.

      *>   . `CODE-SET ALPHANUMERIC AL1`         - FOR and IS omitted
      *> The 2002 introduction gate is unaffected: VersionConformancePass.VisitCodeSetClause keys on the
      *> codeSetForPhrase SUBRULE, never on ctx.FOR(), so `--std 85` still answers COBOLNET0900 here.
