      *> kb/Work PB970 arm 2 - a POINTER / PROGRAM-POINTER argument
      *> passed BY CONTENT to a same-length NON-POINTER formal of a
      *> program called with no program-specifier and no NESTED
      *> phrase arrives as the pointer's STORAGE IMAGE.
      *> ISO 14.8.2.3.3 rule 1: "the formal parameter shall be of the
      *> same length as the corresponding argument" - the whole rule
      *> when the formal is not of class object or pointer, so a
      *> POINTER into PIC X(8) or BINARY-DOUBLE conforms.
      *> ISO 14.2.3 GR9: "That argument is moved to this allocated
      *> record without conversion" - the formal holds the pointer's
      *> 8 storage positions, in a record that does not occupy the
      *> argument's storage.
      *> The 8 positions are docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-216: NULL
      *> (any category) is eight X"00"; a data-pointer is its storage
      *> area's base plus its displacement as a big-endian 64-bit
      *> integer; a program-pointer is a distinct nonzero token.
      *> Derivation (no measured value is used):
      *>   NULL P            -> all LOW-VALUE           NULL-IMAGE DIFF
      *>   P = ADDRESS OF W  -> nonzero                 NONNULL DIFF
      *>   Q = P             -> equal pointers, equal images: SAME
      *>   the callee's MOVE ALL "Z" reaches only its record: P = Q
      *>   read as BINARY-DOUBLE: SET P UP BY 3 moves it +3, DOWN BY 3
      *>   moves it -3 (base + displacement)
      *>   PP = ENTRY        -> nonzero, not the data token: DIFF
      *>   PP NULL, then P NULL -> NULL-IMAGE DIFF, then SAME (every
      *>   category's NULL is the zero address)
