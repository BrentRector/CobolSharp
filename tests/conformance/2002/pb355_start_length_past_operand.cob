      *> !! START'S TEMPORARY KEY AREA IS CUT OUT OF THE RECORD AREA
      *> (kb/Work PB355). ISO 1989:2023 14.9.41.4 GR17 a): "The
      *> specified key is set up by moving the relevant parts of the
      *> record area into a temporary data area." b): "The length of
      *> this temporary area is considered to be the length specified
      *> in the LENGTH clause, if specified, or else the length of
      *> record-key-name-1, if specified, or else the length of
      *> data-name-1."  GR16 says which key a) means: "The key
      *> specified in the KEY phrase, or that shares a leftmost
      *> character with the data item specified in the KEY phrase,
      *> becomes the key of reference."
      *> So the search key is THE KEY OF REFERENCE'S CHARACTERS IN THE
      *> RECORD AREA, cut to the b) length - data-name-1 names the key
      *> and supplies a default length, and is never itself the source.
      *> The two readings coincide for every length no longer than
      *> data-name-1 (a generic key's own content IS the area's content
      *> at those positions - 13.18.33.4 GR3: "Multiple level 1 entries
      *> subordinate to a FD or SD entry represent implicit
      *> redefinitions of the same area"), so only a LENGTH counting
      *> PAST the operand can tell them apart. A1-A4 do; A5-A6 are the
      *> complement, pinning that the short case did not move.
      *>
      *> THE FILE (written in ascending prime-key order, 14.9.51):
      *>   prime  alt    data        prime order   alternate order
      *>   AB01   ZZ01   REC-01      AB01 AB99 CD01   YY01 ZZ01 ZZ99
      *>   AB99   ZZ99   REC-99
      *>   CD01   YY01   REC-CD
      *> GN-PFX (X(2) at the prime key's leftmost position) and GN-APFX
      *> (X(2) at the alternate key's) are 14.9.41.3 SR6 b) generic
      *> keys: same class, category and usage, and shorter.
      *> 14.9.30.4 GR21 b) makes the START-selected record the one the
      *> following READ NEXT delivers; 9.1.13.2 rule 1 gives '00'.
      *>
      *> DERIVATION, arm by arm - every value below is computed from
      *> the rules above, none from the compiler:
      *>  A1  area prime = "AB01", LENGTH 4 -> temp "AB01"; keys cut to
      *>      4 are AB01/AB99/CD01; EQUAL stops on AB01     -> REC-01.
      *>      Building the temp from GN-PFX instead gives "AB" padded
      *>      to "AB  ", which equals no key at all: '23'.
      *>  A2  area prime = "AB99", LENGTH 3 -> temp "AB9"; keys cut to
      *>      3 are AB0/AB9/CD0; EQUAL stops on AB99        -> REC-99.
      *>      From GN-PFX: "AB " - again no match, '23'.
      *>  A3  area prime = "AB50", LENGTH 4, operator GREATER -> temp
      *>      "AB50"; the first key cut to 4 that exceeds it is AB99
      *>                                                   -> REC-99.
      *>      From GN-PFX: "AB  ", and "AB01" > "AB  " is TRUE, so the
      *>      padded reading answers REC-01 - a WRONG RECORD, silently.
      *>  A4  the ALTERNATE key of reference: area alt = "YY01",
      *>      LENGTH 4 -> temp "YY01"; the alternate keys cut to 4 are
      *>      YY01/ZZ01/ZZ99 and EQUAL stops on YY01, whose record is
      *>      the CD01 one                                 -> REC-CD.
      *>      From GN-APFX: "YY  ", no match, '23'.
      *>  A5  the complement - LENGTH 2, no longer than GN-PFX, so both
      *>      readings give "AB" out of the area's "ABZZ"; keys cut to
      *>      2 are AB/AB/CD and NOT LESS stops on AB01     -> REC-01.
      *>      (Had the LENGTH been ignored, "AB01" >= "ABZZ" is false
      *>      and the answer would be REC-CD, so the arm also pins that
      *>      the count is honoured.)
      *>  A6  no LENGTH phrase: GR17 b)'s "else the length of
      *>      data-name-1" makes the temp TWO characters, "AB" out of
      *>      the same "ABZZ", and EQUAL stops on AB01      -> REC-01.
      *>      (Defaulting to the KEY's length 4 would compare "ABZZ"
      *>      and find nothing: '23'.)
      *>  A7  GR14 - "If arithmetic-expression-1 does not evaluate to a
      *>      positive nonzero integer that is less than or equal to
      *>      the length of the associated key, the I-O status value
