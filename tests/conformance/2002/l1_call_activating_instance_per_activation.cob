      *> (cite.py --check 14.9.4.4 "The instance of the program, function, or method that executes the CALL

      *>
      *> WHAT THE RULE ASSERTS, DERIVED BEFORE MEASURING. The activating runtime element is an INSTANCE,
      *> not a compilation unit. Three consequences follow, and this file pins all three in one run:
      *>   (a) the called program is located in the ACTIVATOR's §8.4.6.3 scope — a contained program is
      *>       reachable from its container's own activation;
      *>   (b) on return, control resumes IN THAT INSTANCE, so the activation's own automatic data
      *>       (LOCAL-STORAGE, §13.6.4 GR1 / §14.6.2.3.2 — allocated per activation) is intact;
      *>   (c) anything that reaches the activating element answers PER ACTIVATION — including the
      *>       container handle through which a CONTAINED callee reads a GLOBAL item of its container
      *>       (§13.18.27 GR2). §13.18.27.3 SR1b permits IS GLOBAL on a level-1 entry of the LOCAL-STORAGE
      *>       section, which is the ONE composition that makes (c) observable: the item is per-activation
      *>       AND visible to the containee.
      *>
      *> DERIVED TRACE. L1ACTR is RECURSIVE, so each activation gets its own instance and its own
      *> LOCAL-STORAGE; §11.10.4 GR4 ("the program and any programs contained within it are recursive")
      *> gives L1ACTC the attribute too, so it is likewise per-activation and binds to the container
      *> instance that activated it.
      *>   D=1 tags its frame 11, activates the containee     -> R-ENTER D=1 TAG=11 / C-SEES=11
      *>   D=1 re-enters itself; D=2 tags ITS frame 22        -> R-ENTER D=2 TAG=22 / C-SEES=22
      *>   D=2 resumes after its (skipped) recursion and calls the containee again
      *>                                                      -> R-RESUME D=2 TAG=22 / C-SEES=22
      *>   D=2 returns; control resumes in the D=1 INSTANCE   -> R-RESUME D=1 TAG=11   (leg b)
      *>   D=1 activates the containee once more              -> C-SEES=11             (leg c)
      *> The two failure shapes this discriminates: a registry slot left naming the DEAD depth-2 instance
      *> prints C-SEES=22 on the last line, and a containee whose container handle is bound ONCE at
      *> construction prints C-SEES=11 on the second and third.
