      *> ISO 15.100.3 r1 - YEAR-TO-YYYY argument-1's VALUE domain, both arms. The row AR-15.100.3-1 was held
      *> at PARTIAL by two things: the integer-ness half (kb/Work PB248 - a floating-point argument-1 passed
      *> the 15.3 type-6 screen and was truncated) and the absence of any fixture pinning r1's REJECT edge.
      *> PB248 closed the first; this closes the second, so the row's evidence is complete on both halves.
      *>
      *> THE RULE, --check validated:
      *>   cite.py --check 15.100.3 "Argument-1 shall be a nonnegative integer that is less than 100"
      *>     -> OK 15.100.3 1). The domain is the closed interval [0, 99]: 0 is admitted ("nonnegative"),
      *>     99 is admitted ("less than 100"), 100 and every negative value are not.
      *>   cite.py --check 15.3 "the EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION exception condition is set to exist"
      *>     -> OK 15.3 14). Checking is TURNED ON because 15.3's closing sentence makes the RESULT
      *>     implementor-defined while checking is off - with it off this rule has no spec-fixed
      *>     observable at all, and a green test would prove nothing.

      *> THE ACCEPTED VALUES, DERIVED FROM 15.100.4 (not observed). With argument-2 = 50 and argument-3 =
      *> 2000, maximum-year = argument-2 + argument-3 = 2050 (r1), and FUNCTION MOD(2050, 100) = 50.
      *>   argument-1 = 0  : 50 >= 0  is TRUE  -> r2a: 0  + 100 * INTEGER(2050/100) = 0  + 100*20 = 2000
      *>   argument-1 = 99 : 50 >= 99 is FALSE -> r2b: 99 + 100 * (INTEGER(2050/100) - 1) = 99 + 1900 = 1999
      *>   argument-1 = 50 : 50 >= 50 is TRUE  -> r2a: 50 + 100*20 = 2050
      *> argument-3 is written explicitly so the window is FIXED and the expected values do not depend on
      *> the year at the time of execution (15.100.3 r5 / NOTE 2 - an omitted argument-3 slides).
      *>
      *> BOTH ARMS, AND BOTH ENDPOINTS. A closed-interval rule is falsified from two directions: by raising
      *> on 0 or 99 (over-rejecting legal source) and by staying silent at 100 or below zero. Lines 1-3 are
      *> the ACCEPT arm and 4-5 the REJECT arm; line 5 comes from a runtime data item so no constant fold
      *> can see the violation.
