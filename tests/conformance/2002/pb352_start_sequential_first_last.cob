      *> ISO 1989:2023 §14.9.41 START on SEQUENTIAL organization — the
      *> arm the standard REQUIRES and this compiler refused until
      *> kb/Work PB352. §14.9.41.3 SR2: "If the organization of the file
      *> referenced by file-name-1 is sequential, either the FIRST or
      *> the LAST phrase shall be specified" — so START is not merely
      *> permitted here, FIRST/LAST is the ONLY form it can take.
      *> The values below are read off the SEQUENTIAL FILES general
      *> rules, not off a run:
      *>   GR20  FIRST — "the file position indicator is set to 1 if
      *>         records exist in the physical file. If no records
      *>         exist in the file, or the physical file does not
      *>         support the ability to position at the first record,
      *>         the I-O status value … is set to '23', the invalid key
      *>         condition exists, and the execution of the START
      *>         statement is unsuccessful."
      *>   GR21  LAST — the twin, at "the record number of the last
      *>         existing logical record in the physical file".
      *>   GR2   "The execution of the START statement does not alter
      *>         either the content of the record area …" — AREA= below
      *>         prints the value MOVEd in before the START, unchanged.
      *>   GR1   the open mode shall be input or I-O; Table 20's blank
      *>         Output/Extend cells are §9.1.13.7 item 7's '47', and
      *>         neither INVALID nor NOT INVALID runs for a '4x'
      *>         (§9.1.14 keys the two branches on the invalid key
      *>         condition and on successful completion).
      *>   GR5   an OPTIONAL input file that is not present raises the
      *>         invalid key condition — §9.1.13.5 item 3 b)'s '23'.
      *>   GR7   after an unsuccessful START "the file position
      *>         indicator is set to indicate that no valid record
      *>         position has been established", which §9.1.13.7 item
      *>         6 a) reads back as '46' on the next sequential READ.
      *> The record the next READ delivers is §14.9.30.4 GR21's own
      *> sequential arm b): "If the file position indicator was
      *> established by a prior successful OPEN or START statement, the
      *> first existing record that is selected is made available" —
      *> INCLUSIVE positioning, so START FIRST + READ yields record 1
      *> and START LAST + READ yields the last record.
      *> Both §9.1.7.2 types of sequential file are walked, because the
      *> connector frames them differently (fixed-width blocks vs.
      *> newline-delimited lines) and GR20/GR21 are stated over
      *> "records", not over a framing.
