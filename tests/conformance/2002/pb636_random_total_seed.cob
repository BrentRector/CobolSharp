      *> kb/Work PB636 — ISO §15.75 RANDOM's SEED is a TOTAL argument, and this program pins the half
      *> that had no coverage: a seed past the 64-bit window, WITH EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION CHECKING ON.
      *>
      *> THE RULE. §15.75.3 r2 is one sentence about the SIGN — "If argument-1 is specified, it shall
      *> be zero or a positive integer. It is used as the seed value to generate a sequence of
      *> pseudo-random numbers" — and places no constraint on the MAGNITUDE. §15.75.4 r1 answers for
      *> every accepted seed: "The returned value is greater than or equal to zero and less than one";
      *> r2 fixes reproducibility: "For a given seed value on a given implementation, the sequence of
      *> pseudo-random numbers will always be the same". §15.75.4 r3 is a FLOOR, not a domain — "The
      *> implementor shall specify the subset of the domain of argument-1 values that will yield
      *> distinct sequences of pseudo-random numbers. This subset shall include the values from 0
      *> through at least 32767" — so a seed outside that subset is still a LEGAL argument whose
      *> sequence r1/r2 define, and §15.3's closing paragraph sets EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION only when an
      *> argument "results in an incorrect value for that argument or for the returned value according
      *> to the rules specified in the function definition". There is no such value here, so a
      *> conforming program may pass any non-negative integer and must get a value in [0, 1), never
      *> an abort. The defect: the seed rode the PARTIAL-function narrowing, so a 19-digit seed
      *> terminated the run unit under checking and substituted the ARGUMENT 0 with checking off.
      *>
      *> ⚠ NO PSEUDO-RANDOM VALUE IS PRINTED, and none may be: r3 leaves the sequences themselves
      *> implementor-defined. Every leg asserts a RULE — the r1 range, the r2 repeat, the r3 floor's
      *> distinctness — so each expected line is derived from the standard, never observed.
      *>
      *> ⚠ WITNESSED AT 2002 THOUGH THE RULE IS 85's. RANDOM is a COBOL-85 function and the seed is
      *> total at every edition, but the WITNESS is not writable below 2002: the 19-to-31-digit
      *> ITEM is §13.18.40.3 r14's ("the number of digit positions described by
      *> character-string-1 shall range from 1 through 31") and the 19-to-31-digit LITERAL is
      *> §8.3.3.3.2's ("fixed-point numeric literals of 1 through 31 digits in length");
      *> both are 2002+, and >>TURN is the 2002 exception model. Below 2002 every
      *> writable seed fits the 64-bit window, so the behaviour does not differ by edition — only the
      *> ability to state it does.
      *>
      *> ARMED, NOT ASSUMED. A checking-ON leg proves nothing if the directive is inert, so A0 raises
      *> the condition from the ONE rule that does constrain this argument — §15.75.3 r2's sign — and
      *> the declarative reports it. Every leg after it runs under the same armed directive.
