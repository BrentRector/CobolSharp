      *> kb/Work PB549 at the INTRODUCING EDITION of the construct: §14.9.39.2 Format 9
      *> (program-pointer-assignment) and the §8.4.3.13 PROGRAM-ADDRESS-IDENTIFIER that fills it are the
      *> COBOL-2002 program-pointer family.  The identifier's printed general format (PDF p172/folio 142,
      *> RENDERED at 300 dpi) is
      *>       ADDRESS OF PROGRAM { identifier-1 | literal-1 | program-prototype-name-1 }
      *> with ADDRESS and PROGRAM underlined and OF NOT underlined, and the braces are a plain required
      *> choice -- exactly one operand.
      *> ⛔ IT WAS IN THE GRAMMAR AT NO EDITION.  `SET PP TO ADDRESS OF PROGRAM "X"` was
      *> `error COBOL0001: cannot parse construct near 'PROGRAM'`, and the ONLY route into a program-pointer
      *> was `SET PP TO ENTRY "X"` -- the Micro Focus / IBM spelling, whose words appear in no ISO general
      *> format.  So the standard spelling was rejected and the extension was mandatory.
      *> THE FOUR LINES BELOW ARE THE FOUR THINGS THE FORMAT ADMITS:
      *>   1  literal-1                    -- §8.4.3.13.3 SR2, §8.4.3.13.4 GR1 b) "the value of literal-1"
      *>   2  the same with OF OMITTED     -- §8.3.2.4.3: an unstressed reserved word is optional, and the
      *>                                      figure underlines ADDRESS and PROGRAM only
      *>   3  identifier-1                 -- §8.4.3.13.3 SR1 (alphanumeric or national), §8.4.3.13.4 GR1 a)
      *>                                      "the content of the data item referenced by identifier-1"
      *>   4  program-prototype-name-1     -- §8.4.3.13.3 SR3 (declared in the REPOSITORY paragraph)
      *> ⚠ ARM 4 IS THE ONE THAT PINS §8.4.3.13.4 GR2: "For a COBOL program, the address is that of the
      *> outermost program identified by the EXTERNALIZED program-name in its PROGRAM-ID paragraph."  The
      *> prototype is written PB549P and its externalized name is "PB549X", so an implementation that took
      *> the source word instead of the externalized name would not find the program at all.
      *> EXPECTED, derived from those rules and never measured -- four lines, one per CALL through the
      *> pointer, in the order the four arms are written:
      *>   SUB / SUB / SUB / PROTO
