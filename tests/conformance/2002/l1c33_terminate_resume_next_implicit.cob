      *> R-B was never initiated. TERMINATE R-C R-B R-A is three
      *> implicit TERMINATEs in written order (GR4 sentence 1):
      *>   R-C: its RF is produced              -> "RF-C"
      *>   R-B: inactive, EC-REPORT-INACTIVE raised (checking is ON);
      *>        the declarative runs            -> "INACTIVE EC-REPORT-
      *>        INACTIVE" and RESUMEs AT NEXT STATEMENT, which per GR4
      *>        is the next implicit TERMINATE, R-A -> "RF-A"
      *>   then the statement ends              -> "AFTER"
      *> An implementation that resumed after the whole TERMINATE
      *> statement would omit "RF-A". The fatal EC is handled by the
      *> declarative, so the run unit continues.
