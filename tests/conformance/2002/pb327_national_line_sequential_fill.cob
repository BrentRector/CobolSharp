      *> kb/Work PB327 - 14.9.30.4 GR15's NATIONAL SPACE FILL. "For a
      *> line sequential file, if the number of bytes in the record
      *> that is read is less than the minimum size specified by the
      *> record description entries for file-name-1, the portion of the
      *> record area that is to the right of the last valid character
      *> read is padded with trailing spaces. If the record-area
      *> associated with file-name-1 is specified implicitly or
      *> explicitly as alphanumeric, a trailing space is defined to be
      *> the alphanumeric space character. If the record-area
      *> associated with file-name-1 is specified implicitly or
      *> explicitly as national, a trailing space is defined to be the
      *> national space character."
      *> L-REC is an elementary national record area, so the fill is
      *> the NATIONAL space: U+0020 stored as the two bytes 00 20
      *> (13.18.60.4 GR8 / D-N1). ORD over the shared byte view is
      *> what distinguishes it - an alphanumeric byte pad would leave
      *> 20 20, i.e. 033/033, which is the character U+2020, not a
      *> space at all. The WRITE sheds the same national spaces, so
      *> the physical line is four bytes and the read re-fills them.
