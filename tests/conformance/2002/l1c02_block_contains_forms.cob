      *>  OK §13.18.10.1 The BLOCK CONTAINS clause specifies the size
      *>     of a physical record.
      *>  OK §13.18.10.3 1) If integer-1 is specified, integer-2 shall
      *>     be greater than integer-1.  (10<100, 10<20 below)
      *>  OK §13.18.10.4 1) This clause is required except when one or
      *>     more of the following conditions exist
      *>  OK §13.18.10.4 1) a) A physical record contains one and only
      *>     one complete logical record.
      *>  OK §13.18.10.4 2) The size of a physical record may be stated
      *>     in terms of records unless one or more of the following
      *>     situations exists, in which case the RECORDS phrase shall
      *>     not be used
      *>  OK §A.3 5) The BLOCK CONTAINS clause has no effect if the
      *>     operating environment does not support the required
      *>     features  (docs/CONFORMANCE.md A.3 row 5: Claimed (inert)
      *>     "Accepted; no effect on the managed I-O model").

      *>  FB  BLOCK 100                       (no CONTAINS, no unit
      *>                                  word: CHARACTERS by default)
      *>  FC  BLOCK CONTAINS 10 TO 100 CHARACTERS (TO, CHARACTERS)
      *>  FD2 BLOCK 10 TO 20 RECORDS          (TO, RECORDS, no CONTAINS)
      *>  FE  no BLOCK CONTAINS at all - GR1: the managed I-O model
      *>      writes one logical record per physical record, so
      *>      condition a) holds and the clause is not required.
      *>  GR2: none of the situations a)-c) exists (no records span
      *>      physical records, no padding, no grouping), so the RECORDS
      *>      phrase of FA and FD2 is permitted and must be accepted.
      *> Derivation: every FD is legal, so the program compiles. By
      *> A.3 5) (the documented inert claim) the clause changes nothing
      *> about the logical records, so each file, written with three
      *> 8-character records R1..R3 and read back sequentially, returns
      *> exactly those records in order and then AT END:
