      *> PB64 T6 — DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA is INERT for format-2 editing (ISO 12.3.7.4 GR14: "The DECIMAL-POINT IS
      *> COMMA clause has no effect on the editing or de-editing of a data item described with the locale format
      *> of the PICTURE clause"; its NOTE 3: the character WRITTEN for the decimal separator is always the
      *> period). This program is the byte-identity proof: under DPC the same edit produces the SAME bytes the
      *> non-DPC sibling (pb64t6_locale_edit_rules line 1) produces - the output separator is the LOCALE's, and
      *> the picture's '.' keeps its alignment role with no comma/period swap. The de-edit recovers the value
      *> (the literal 1234,50 is the DPC spelling of 1234.50).
