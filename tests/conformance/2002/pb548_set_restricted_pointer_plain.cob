      *>  . 14.9.39.4 GR12 - "the address identified by identifier-6 is stored in each data item
      *>    referenced by identifier-5" - so after SET P2 P3 TO P1 both hold ADDRESS OF V1, and the based
      *>    item L rebased through P3 reads V1's content: L=[ABCD].
      *>  . SET P1 TO NULL stores the predefined address NULL (GR12 again), so P1 = NULL is true: P1-NULL.
      *>  . P2 is untouched by the SET of P1, so L rebased through P2 still reads V1: L2=[ABCD].
      *> The unrestricted-into-restricted and restricted-into-unrestricted spellings of the same arm are
