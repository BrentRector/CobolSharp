      *> ISO 14.9.41.4 GR14: "If arithmetic-expression-1 does not evaluate to a positive nonzero
      *> integer that is less than or equal to the length of the associated key, the I-O status

      *> narrow it to 32 bits at emit time, so 2.5 became 2 and 4294967297 became 1, and all of
      *> L1-L4 positioned with '00'.

      *>  . L1 2.5, L2 3 / 2 (= 1.5), L3 an item holding 2.5: not integers -> '23', INVALID KEY.
