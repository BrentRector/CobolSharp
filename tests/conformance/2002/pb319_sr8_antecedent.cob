      *> kb/Work PB319 - THE COMPLEMENT OF 14.9.27.3 SR8: the rule's
      *> ANTECEDENT, written out and then falsified in each of the two ways
      *> a compilable program can falsify it.
      *> THE RULE (ISO 14.9.27.3 SR8): "When file-name-1 is not subject to
      *> an APPLY COMMIT clause, then if the sharing phrase is omitted from
      *> the OPEN statement and the ALL phrase is specified in the SHARING
      *> clause of the file control entry for file-name-1 or if the ALL
      *> phrase is specified on the OPEN statement, the LOCK MODE clause
      *> shall be specified in the file control entry for file-name-1."
      *> Two disjuncts, and BOTH name an OPEN statement. So:
      *>   (a) F-OVR declares SHARING WITH ALL OTHER and has NO LOCK MODE
      *>       clause, and its OPEN writes its own sharing phrase, NO
      *>       OTHER. Disjunct 1 needs the phrase OMITTED; disjunct 2 needs
      *>       ALL on the OPEN. Neither holds - the program is LEGAL.
      *>   (b) F-NEV declares SHARING WITH ALL OTHER and has NO LOCK MODE
      *>       clause and is NEVER OPENED. SR8 speaks only about an OPEN
      *>       statement's file-name-1, so it never speaks - LEGAL.
      *> THAT THIS PROGRAM COMPILES AT ALL IS THE ASSERTION for both. It
      *> used to be rejected COBOLNET1512 at the SELECT line, by a second
      *> copy of SR8 in DataBinder.BindFileControl that had to drop the
      *> antecedent because a file control entry cannot see an OPEN.
      *> THE PRINTED STATUSES stop a compiler from passing this by simply
      *> IGNORING the sharing phrase: if NO OTHER did not override the
      *> file control entry's ALL OTHER (14.9.27.4 GR23 sentence 1), the
      *> second connector's open would SUCCEED and print 00 instead of 61.
      *> The complement - SR8 still firing when its antecedent HOLDS - is
      *> negative/sharing-all-no-lockmode (the file control clause arm) and
      *> negative/pb316-open-sharing-all-no-lockmode (the OPEN phrase arm).
