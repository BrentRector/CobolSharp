      *> DEFECT REPRO for Annex A.1 item 22, NOT a golden to enable
      *> until docs/CONFORMANCE.md row 22 states the determination it
      *> measures.
      *> 15.16.4 r2 has TWO branches and item 22 is the SECOND one: "If
      *> more than one character has the same position in the national
      *> program collating sequence, the character returned is the first
      *> character defined for that character position. If the order of
      *> multiple characters having the same position is UNDEFINED, the
      *> implementor shall define which of those multiple characters is
      *> returned; for a given implementation, collating sequence, and
      *> ordinal position, every invocation of the CHAR-NATIONAL
      *> function shall return the same character."
      *> Item 22's own title is that second sentence verbatim - "which
      *> one of the multiple characters is returned". Sentence ONE is
      *> decided BY THE STANDARD, not by the implementor: under an
      *> ALPHABET ... FOR NATIONAL ... ALSO phrase 12.3.7.4 GR7 k)6
      *> defines the order ("Literal-1 is the first character in the
      *> sequence of multiple characters defined at that ordinal
      *> position"), which is why the existing golden
      *> 2002/l1_char_national_also_positions says in its own header
      *> that it does NOT close item 22. Row 22 nevertheless documents
      *> the ALSO branch, and the code-location it names
      *> (NationalCollation.CharAt) is the ALSO reader, which cannot
      *> reach the undefined-order branch at all.
      *>
      *> THE BRANCH IS REACHABLE, THROUGH A DIFFERENT CLASS. An ALPHABET
      *> ... FOR NATIONAL IS LOCALE sequence is an algorithm, not a
      *> written order: characters the locale collates EQUALLY share an
      *> ordinal position and their relative order is undefined -
      *> exactly r2's second branch. COBOL.NET's answer lives in
      *> LocaleCollation (determination L7: the positions are
      *> materialized once and CHAR takes "the lowest-coded member of a
      *> rank"), documented under the locale facility, never connected
      *> to item 22, and never measured on the NATIONAL arm -
      *> 2002/pb101_alphabet_locale_pcs is the ALPHANUMERIC arm and its
      *> CHAR leg round-trips "Q", which shares its rank with nobody, so
      *> it does not discriminate the tie rule either.
      *> TIE1 position 1 of a locale national sequence is the rank of
      *>      the COMPLETELY IGNORABLE characters, whose members the
      *>      locale does not order; L7 answers the lowest-coded of
      *>      them, U+0000, and FUNCTION ORD of its DISPLAY-OF image
      *>      under the NATIVE alphanumeric sequence is code unit + 1 =
      *>      1. An implementation returning the HIGHEST-coded member of
      *>      the rank, or the first member the collation table happens
      *>      to list, answers something else.
      *> TIE2 r2's third sentence - the same reference returns the same
      *>      character.
      *>
      *> WARNING - THE EXPECTED VALUES ARE DERIVED FROM DETERMINATION
      *> L7, WHICH IS THE IMPLEMENTOR'S OWN DOCUMENTATION BUT NOT ROW
      *> 22'S. If a run disagrees with them, the disagreement is itself
      *> the finding: the determination item 22 is required to document
      *> has no single written answer today.
