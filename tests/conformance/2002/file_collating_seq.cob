      *> ISO §12.4.5.7 file-control COLLATING SEQUENCE clause (INDEXED record-key
      *> collating). The prime key collates under ALPHABET REV (Z..A), so the
      *> ascending key order is the REVERSE of native: records WRITTEN A, M, Z
      *> read back (READ NEXT) as Z, M, A (§12.4.5.5.3 GR2c — ascending within a
      *> key of reference according to that key's collating sequence). A START
      *> KEY >= "M" under REV positions at M and walks M, A (weights: Z<M<A).
      *> Then an equivalence-class alphabet (EQV maps 'A' and 'B' to one weight)
      *> makes two byte-different keys EQUAL: the second WRITE of a weight-equal
      *> prime key is duplicate-key '22' (§12.4.5.12.4 GR1 — equality per the
      *> collating sequence). Native ordinal ordering would print A,M,Z and admit
      *> both keys; this golden is greenfield-only (the legacy has no clause).
