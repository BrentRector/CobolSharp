      *> derivation. The row spans 85/2002/2014/2023 and the rule text
      *> is unchanged across them, but the DISTINGUISHABLE case needs a
      *> currency symbol that is a letter, and CURRENCY SIGN ... WITH
      *> PICTURE SYMBOL enters at COBOL-2002; at COBOL-85 the only
      *> currency symbol is '$', whose occurrences are always the same

      *> DERIVATION IN BRIEF. §13.18.40.3 SR3 -> §12.3.7.3 SR20 ->
      *> §8.1.3.2 GR3 make 'w' and 'W' equivalent basic letters, so the
      *> three occurrences form ONE floating insertion string
      *> (§13.18.40.5 rule 6). Its second symbol is the leftmost limit
      *> of the numeric data, so the digit positions are 2, 3 and the
      *> '9' at 4; 12 aligns as 012; rule 6a puts one occurrence of the
      *> currency string immediately preceding the first nonzero
      *> numeric character (position 3) and spaces before it. The
      *> inserted characters are literal-7 = "W" (§12.3.7.3 SR23).
      *> Hence [ W12], identically for the all-uppercase control.
