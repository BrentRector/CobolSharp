      *> kb/Work PB993 - the TERMINATION rules of the SORT/MERGE implicit
      *> transfers: what an unsuccessful as-if OPEN / READ / WRITE does to
      *> the statement once its USE procedure (if any) has run.
      *>
      *> THE DEFAULT (every cell no specific rule names): 9.1.13.1 - a
      *> status beginning 3, 4 or 7 (or 9) is FATAL, and "If the
      *> implementor chooses to continue execution of the run unit, control
      *> is transferred to the end of the statement that produced the fatal
      *> exception condition unless the rules for that statement define
      *> other behavior".  The statement is the SORT/MERGE - the as-if
      *> statement is not one of the program's.  14.6.13.1.3 2) puts the
      *> SORT/MERGE rules ahead of the run-unit termination of 5)/7), even
      *> with checking enabled (leg 9).  A nonfatal status continues.
      *> THE SPECIFIC RULES exercised here:
      *>   14.9.40.4 GR15 - "If a fatal exception condition exists for
      *>     file-name-3 as a result of the implicit OPEN during file
      *>     initiation, the SORT is terminated."             (legs 1, 2)
      *>   14.9.40.4 GR12 b) - "If a fatal exception condition exists for
      *>     file-name-1, the SORT is terminated" (the USING file).  (leg 3)
      *>   14.9.24.4 GR7 a) - "If a nonfatal exception condition exists as a
      *>     result of the execution of the implicit OPEN statement, the
      *>     MERGE statement is terminated unless there is an applicable USE
      *>     procedure that completes normally".              (legs 4, 5)
      *>   14.9.24.4 GR12 a) - "If a fatal exception condition exists as a
      *>     result of this implicit OPEN statement and there is an
      *>     applicable USE procedure that completes normally, processing
      *>     for the file connector that caused the exception condition is
      *>     bypassed" - the OTHER GIVING file is still written. (legs 6, 7)
      *>   14.9.24.4 GR12 b) - "If an exception condition exists as a result
      *>     of this implicit WRITE statement and there is an applicable USE
      *>     procedure that completes normally, the MERGE continues
      *>     execution, otherwise the MERGE statement is terminated". (leg 8)
      *> A terminated statement performs none of its remaining implicit
      *> functions (no as-if CLOSE), so the status each leg displays after
      *> the statement is the one that terminated it.  OUT-G is seeded "OLD"
      *> before every leg that must leave it untouched.
