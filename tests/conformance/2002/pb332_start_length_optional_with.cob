      *> !! WITH IS AN OPTIONAL WORD OF THE START LENGTH PHRASE (kb/Work PB332).
      *> ISO 14.9.41.2 prints `[ WITH LENGTH arithmetic-expression-1 ]` with LENGTH underlined and
      *> WITH NOT underlined - measured off the PDF's vector rectangles and confirmed on the 600 dpi
      *> render of printed folio 754. 5.2.3: an uppercase word "not underlined in general formats"
      *> is an OPTIONAL word; 8.3.2.4.3: such a word "may be specified at the user's option with no
      *> effect on the semantics of the format". So START ... LENGTH n and START ... WITH LENGTH n
      *> are the SAME statement, and the first was rejected COBOL0001 until PB332.
      *> DERIVATION - every line below follows from the printed rules, nothing from the compiler.
      *>  . The file holds AA01, AA02, BB01 (14.9.51 WRITE, ascending prime keys).
      *>  . 14.9.41.4 GR17 b): the temporary key area is "the length specified in the LENGTH clause,
      *>    if specified" - so LENGTH 2 makes it "AA" out of the moved key AAZZ; c) truncates each
      *>    record's key to the same 2 characters; e) 1. sets the file position indicator to "the
      *>    first logical record whose key satisfies the comparison". "AA" >= "AA" holds for AA01,
      *>    the first record, so both L1 and L2 read AA01.
      *>  . With no LENGTH phrase the temporary area is "the length of data-name-1" (GR17 b)) = 4,
      *>    and "AA01" >= "AAZZ" and "AA02" >= "AAZZ" are false while "BB01" >= "AAZZ" is true, so
      *>    N1 reads BB01. That contrast is what proves LENGTH 2 was actually honoured and not
      *>    silently ignored.
      *>  . 14.9.41.4 GR4 updates the I-O status; 9.1.13.2 rule 1 gives '00' for a successfully
      *>    executed input-output statement, which covers both the START and the READ.
