      *> ISO §14.9.13.3 SR6 is a MIRRORED PAIR, and this exercises both arms plus the
      *> two identity arms beside them:
      *>   a) "If the selection subject is TRUE or FALSE and the selection object is a
      *>      boolean expression that results in one boolean character, the selection
      *>      object is treated as a boolean condition and therefore condition-2."
      *>   b) "If the selection object is TRUE or FALSE and the selection subject is a
      *>      boolean expression that results in one boolean character, the selection
      *>      subject is treated as a boolean condition and therefore condition-1."
      *>   c)/d) against a counterpart that is NOT TRUE or FALSE the boolean operand
      *>      stays boolean-expression-2 / boolean-expression-1, and Table 15 marks
      *>      boolean-expression × boolean-expression permissible; §14.9.13.4 GR4 a) 6.
      *>      then lowers the pair to `selection-subject = selection-object`.
      *> Arm b) did not exist: the subject stayed a value, the TRUE object bound as a
      *> standalone condition, and the emitted program died at run time on conforming
      *> source (kb/Work PB400).  §8.8.2 makes "an identifier referencing a boolean data
      *> item" and "a boolean literal" boolean expressions, and its rules 9/10 give each
      *> its result length — the length SR6 turns on.
      *> §8.8.4.3.4 GR1 fixes the truth value: "Boolean-expression-1 evaluates true if
      *> the result of the expression is 1 and evaluates false if the result is 0."
