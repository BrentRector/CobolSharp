      *> category.  §8.8.4.2.16: "The operands are equal if they reference the same address."
      *> §8.4.3.10.1 makes NULL "a predefined address of class pointer", and §8.4.3.10.3 SR1 a) admits it

      *> §14.9.13.4 GR2 makes an EVALUATE selection pair a comparison "as if the corresponding relation
      *> condition were written", which is why the same four legs are written under EVALUATE.
