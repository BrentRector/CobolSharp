      *> ISO §13.18.60.3 SR16 — "The ACTIVE-CLASS phrase may be specified only in a factory
      *> definition, an instance definition, or the linkage or local-storage section of a
      *> method definition."  FOUR permitted positions; conformance:2002/
      *> pb389_object_reference_descriptor writes the fourth (a method's LOCAL-STORAGE), and
      *> conformance:negative/pb389-active-class-outside-class and

      *> writes THE OTHER THREE and makes each one OBSERVABLE, so SR16's permission is proved
      *> by a running program rather than by the absence of a diagnostic.  kb/Work PB496.
      *>
      *> Each declaration is also a §13.18.60.4 GR22 e) witness: "If ACTIVE-CLASS is
      *> specified, the object referenced by this data item shall be of the same class as the
      *> object that was used to invoke the method in which this data description entry is
      *> specified" — e)1. the factory object of that class when FACTORY is written, e)2. an
      *> instance object of it when it is not.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE RULES — NOT FROM A RUN:
      *>
      *> 1-2. FAW is declared in the FACTORY definition's WORKING-STORAGE (SR16 position 1)
      *>    as FACTORY OF ACTIVE-CLASS.  FMK is a factory method; SET FAW TO SELF is
      *>    §14.9.39.3 SR14 b)2. (the receiver carries the FACTORY phrase and the method IS
      *>    defined in the factory definition).  GR22 e)1. then binds FAW to the factory
      *>    object of the class that invoked the method, so INVOKE FAW "TAG" prints  FTAG-C
      *>    when invoked on PB496C and                                               FTAG-D
      *>    when the SAME inherited method is invoked on PB496D.
      *>    DISCRIMINATOR: an ACTIVE-CLASS item bound statically to its CONTAINING class
      *>    prints FTAG-C both times.
      *>
      *> 3-4. AW is declared in the INSTANCE definition's WORKING-STORAGE (SR16 position 2)
      *>    as a plain ACTIVE-CLASS reference.  MK is an instance method; SET AW TO SELF is
      *>    SR14 b)1., and GR22 e)2. binds AW to an instance object of the invoking object's
      *>    class.  INVOKE AW "WHO" prints                                            WHO-C
      *>    then, on a PB496D object,                                                 WHO-D.
      *>
      *> 5-6. P is declared in a method's LINKAGE SECTION (SR16 position 3) as ACTIVE-CLASS
      *>    and received BY REFERENCE through PROCEDURE DIVISION USING.  MK passes AW to it,
      *>    an ACTIVE-CLASS argument into an ACTIVE-CLASS formal, and TAKE invokes WHO on it,
      *>    so each MK prints its class's WHO twice — WHO-C WHO-C, then WHO-D WHO-D.
