      *> !! THE SAME RULE ON A NATIONAL KEY, WHERE THE INVENTED PAD IS
      *> NOT EVEN A CHARACTER (kb/Work PB355). ISO 1989:2023
      *> 14.9.41.4 GR17 a): "The specified key is set up by moving the
      *> relevant parts of the record area into a temporary data area."
      *> GR13 fixes the LENGTH unit: "if data-name-1 or
      *> record-key-name-1 is of class national, arithmetic-expression-1
      *> is the number of national character positions" - so LENGTH 2
      *> is TWO NATIONAL POSITIONS, four bytes of the eight-byte key.
      *> GN-PFX is ONE national position (14.9.41.3 SR6 b): leftmost-
      *> coincident with the prime key, same class, category and usage,
      *> and shorter), so a LENGTH of 2 counts one position PAST it and
      *> the missing position has to come from the RECORD AREA.
      *> Taking data-name-1's own two bytes and padding to four with
      *> the alphanumeric space manufactures 0x20 0x20 where a national
      *> position is a UTF-16BE PAIR - 14.9.30.4 GR15 says a trailing
      *> national space is "the national space character", two bytes -
      *> so the padded reading does not merely search for the wrong
      *> value, it searches for a value no record area can hold.
      *>
      *> THE FILE (ascending prime keys, 14.9.51):
      *>   N"AAAA" ONE  /  N"ABBB" TWO  /  N"ACCC" THREE
      *> First two positions of each key: AA, AB, AC.
      *> 14.9.30.4 GR21 b) makes the START-selected record the one the
      *> following READ NEXT delivers; 9.1.13.2 rule 1 gives '00'.
      *>
      *> DERIVATION:
      *>  N1  MOVE N"AB" to the 4-position key space-fills the area to
      *>      N"AB  ". LENGTH 2 -> the temporary area is the key's first
      *>      TWO positions IN THE AREA, N"AB"; each record's key is cut
      *>      to two positions (AA / AB / AC) and EQUAL stops on ABBB
      *>                                                    -> TWO.
      *>      From GN-PFX alone: 00 41 padded with 20 20, which equals
      *>      none of 00 41 00 41 / 00 41 00 42 / 00 41 00 43: '23'.
      *>  N2  the same area, operator GREATER: the first key whose two
      *>      positions exceed N"AB" is ACCC          -> THREE.
      *>      From GN-PFX: 00 41 20 20 exceeds all three (0x20 > 0x00
      *>      at the third byte), so nothing is greater: '23'.
      *>  N3  the complement - LENGTH 1 is no longer than GN-PFX, both
      *>      readings give N"A", and every key starts with it, so the
      *>      FIRST record answers                     -> ONE.
