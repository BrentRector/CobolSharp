      *> ISO §14.9.25.4 GR6 d) 3 — THE SIZE RULE SEEN WHOLE, at the earliest edition with a receiver wide
      *> enough to hold the entire windowed operand (a 19-31 digit fixed-point item is COBOL-2002,
      *> §8.3.3.3.2; at COBOL-85 the eighteen-digit ceiling truncates the window before it can be read
      *> back, which is why 85/pb426_alnum_sender_31_character_cap measures the rule a different way).
      *> Checking is DELIBERATELY not enabled here — leg 2's sender is not all digits, and the condition
      *> that would raise for it is the subject of the sibling golden
      *> 2002/pb426_alnum_sender_data_incompatible.
      *>
      *> THE RULES, --check validated:
      *>   cite.py --check 14.9.25.4 "When the sending operand is described as alphanumeric or national,
      *>     the sending operand is treated as if it were an unsigned integer of category numeric"
      *>     -> OK §14.9.25.4 6) 3.
      *>   cite.py --check 14.9.25.4 "in which case the rightmost 31 character positions are used"
      *>     -> OK §14.9.25.4 6) 3.  (sub-rule a — the DATA ITEM size rule)
      *>   cite.py --check 14.9.25.4 "only the rightmost 31 characters in the literal are used"
      *>     -> OK §14.9.25.4 6) 3.  (sub-rule c — the LITERAL size rule, leg 3)
      *>
      *> WHY EACH LEG CAN FAIL:
      *>   1  A40 -> PIC 9(31).  The receiver holds the whole windowed operand, so the window is visible in
      *>      full: A40's rightmost 31 character positions are "0123456789012345678901234567890".  Before
      *>      kb/Work PB426 the decode read all forty positions into a signed Int128, WRAPPED, and stored
      *>      7560297064841152750825838277934 — the low-order 31 digits of the two's-complement value.
      *>   2  EMB -> PIC 9(31).  THE DISCRIMINATOR BETWEEN THE TWO READINGS OF THE CAP.  EMB holds 34
      *>      character positions of which 29 are digits.  The rule caps CHARACTER POSITIONS, so the
      *>      operand is EMB's rightmost 31 positions, "456789012345678901234567890ABCD", whose digits are
      *>      the 27-digit 456789012345678901234567890 -> 0000456789012345678901234567890.  Capping at 31
      *>      DIGIT characters instead would never fire (there are only 29) and would answer
      *>      0012456789012345678901234567890.  §14.6.13.2 is what makes the two differ: a non-digit
      *>      position contributes no digit but still OCCUPIES a position.
      *>   3  A 40-character alphanumeric LITERAL -> PIC 9(31).  Sub-rule c is a separate sentence of the
      *>      standard from sub-rule a and a separate emit site in the compiler (the literal operand, not a
      *>      field read); it must window identically -> 0123456789012345678901234567890.
      *>   4  A31 -> PIC 9(31).  Exactly AT the cap, so unwindowed: the control that fails an off-by-one
      *>      window (a rightmost-30 window would drop its leading 1).
