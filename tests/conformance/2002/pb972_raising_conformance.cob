      *> "If the RAISING phrase is specified in the procedure division
      *> header of the method in interface-1, the corresponding method in
      *> interface-2 specifies the RAISING phrase following these rules":
      *>  a) an exception-name - the same exception-name (W4);
      *>  b) an object-class-name - the same object-class-name or the
      *>     name of a superclass of the class identified by that
      *>     object-class-name (W1: the class raises PB972E1, the
      *>     prototype lists its superclass PB972E0), or the name of an
      *>     interface implemented by the instance object of that class
      *>     (W2: PB972E1's OBJECT paragraph IMPLEMENTS PB972IX);
      *>  c) an interface-name - the same interface-name or the name of an
      *>     interface inherited by that interface (W3: the class raises
      *>     PB972IB, which INHERITS the listed PB972IA).
      *> The rule constrains interface-2 only where interface-1 HAS a
      *> RAISING element, so W5 (the class raises nothing, the prototype
      *> lists PB972E0) conforms too. 9.3.11 makes the implementing class
      *> conform to its interface (the class is interface-1); 11.7.3 SR9
      *> makes an override conform to the method it overrides (the
      *> override is interface-1): PB972SUB's M raises PB972E1 where
      *> PB972BASE's M lists PB972E0, its superclass - conforming.
      *> Every method runs and returns normally; the output is the trace.
