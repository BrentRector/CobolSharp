      *> PB64 T6 — the format-2 editing rules battery (ISO 13.18.40.5 r14/r15, 13.18.40.4 GR16-GR18) under the
      *> NAMED locale en-US (all-ASCII: currency "$", decimal ".", grouping "," by threes, negative convention
      *> "-$n" per CurrencyNegativePattern 1, positive sign "+" at the determined p_sign_posn 1).
      *> Hand-derived expectations, each from its rule:
      *>   A +1234.50 -> "+$    1,234.50" right-justified in 20 (r14 a; suppressed zeros AND the suppressed run's
      *>     grouping separator become spaces BETWEEN the currency string and the first significant digit - r15 a
      *>     "any character position"; nothing floats).
      *>   A -1234.50 -> "-$    1,234.50" (r13 + the locale's negative convention).
      *>   de-edit A -> -1234.50 recovered (14.9.25.4 GR5/GR6 d - "may be signed").
      *>   B (all-Z picture) ZERO -> ALL 10 positions spaces, no separator, no currency, no sign (r15 b).
      *>   B 5.25 -> " $    5.25" (suppression stops at the first nonzero digit).
      *>   C (BLANK WHEN ZERO) ZERO -> all spaces (r10 precedence); 42 -> "  $0,042" (no Z - no suppression).
      *>   D SIZE 8 vs a 12-position hypothetical: the four truncated characters are ALL suppressed-zero spaces,
      *>     so the truncation is SILENT (r14 b's exemption) - "1,234.50".
      *>   E no '.' in the picture -> no decimal separator at all (GR18 - '.' is its only source).
