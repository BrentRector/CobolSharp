      *> Derivation, by output line:
      *>  1-2 INVOKE OC "M": C.M prints C.M, then SUPER "M" ignores C's
      *>      own M (GR3) and resolves in the superclass B: B.M.
      *>  3-4 INVOKE OC "X" (X in B only): B.X's SUPER "M" ignores B's
      *>      M AND C's M - C is a subclass of the containing class B
      *>      (GR3) - so A.M runs, although the runtime object is a C.
      *>      Inside A.M, SELF is still OC (GR1), so SELF "WHO"
      *>      resolves on runtime class C (GR2): C.WHO.
      *>  5-6 INVOKE OB "X": same path, but SELF is OB, class B has no
      *>      WHO of its own, so A.WHO.
      *>  7-9 INVOKE OC "Z": C.Z does SUPER "BUMP" then SELF "BUMP";
      *>      both reference OC (GR1), so A's per-object CNT goes 1, 2;
      *>      main then INVOKEs OC "BUMP" directly: 3. A SUPER that
      *>      referenced any other object would print CNT=1 twice.
