      *> Row pinned: FMT-11.5.2 (the Format 2 arms no other golden
      *> covers: "[ AS literal-1 ]" present, and "IS" omitted).
      *>  Format 2 (prototype): "FUNCTION-ID. function-prototype-
      *>    name-1 [ AS literal-1 ] IS PROTOTYPE."  AS and PROTOTYPE
      *>    are underlined; IS is not, so by §5.2.3 it is an optional
      *>    word ("shown in uppercase and not underlined in general
      *>    formats") and may be omitted.
      *>  Format 1 (definition): "FUNCTION-ID. user-function-name-1
      *>    [ AS literal-1 ] ." (with AS, as the definition of L1C10SQ).
      *>  §11.5.4 GR2: literal-1 "is the name of the function
      *>    prototype that is externalized to the operating
      *>    environment". §12.3.8.4 GR11 b): a REPOSITORY function
      *>    specifier whose externalized name (its AS literal-5)
      *>    matches a prototype definition's takes the details from
      *>    that prototype; the function activated is the one with
      *>    the same externalized name - here the definition
      *>    FUNCTION-ID. L1C10SQ AS "L1C10SQX" that FOLLOWS the
      *>    caller. L1C10CU uses the prototype spelling without IS
      *>    and without AS (externalized name = the name itself).
