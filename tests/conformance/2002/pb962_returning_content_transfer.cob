      *> kb/Work PB962 - A RETURNING ITEM DELIVERS ITS CONTENT, NOT A RE-PARSED VALUE.
      *>
      *> 14.6.5: "The result of the execution of a program, function, or method that specifies a RETURNING
      *> phrase in its procedure division header, is the content of the data item referenced by that
      *> RETURNING phrase", and "the result is placed in the data item referenced by that RETURNING phrase of
      *> that activating statement". 14.8.3.3: a conforming receiver has "the same ALIGN, BLANK WHEN ZERO,
      *> DYNAMIC LENGTH, JUSTIFIED, PICTURE, SIGN, and USAGE clauses" - every pair below is identically
      *> described, so each delivery is a content transfer under ONE description.
      *>
      *> EXPECTED VALUES, DERIVED:
      *>   D1 - P962S's returning item holds three SPACES (written through its REDEFINES). They are its
      *>        content, and the redefined receiver RSP takes them as they stand. This used to ABORT the run
      *>        unit with EC-PROGRAM-ARG-MISMATCH: the character result was re-parsed as a number.
      *>   D2 - P962N returns -12.5 in PIC S9(3)V9 (native storage in the callee). The receiver RIM is held as
      *>        its character image (it is redefined), and its image is 012N: digits 0125 with the negative
      *>        sign over-punched into the last digit (5 -> N, DOC-A.1-177's default convention). It used to
      *>        arrive as 012E (+12.5): the delivery wrote the value's C# text "-125", which dropped the sign.
      *>   D3 - the same result into a natively held receiver of the same description: 012N (the control).
      *>   D4 - P962P returns 12345 in PIC 9(5) COMP-3 whose storage is its character image (redefined); the
      *>        receiver RP has the same description and receives the same value.
