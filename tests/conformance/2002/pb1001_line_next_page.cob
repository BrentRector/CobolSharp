      *> THE LINE CLAUSE'S NEXT PAGE PHRASE, BOTH OPERAND FORMS, ON A BODY GROUP AND ON A REPORT FOOTING
      *> (kb/Work PB1001 — `LINE integer-1 ON NEXT PAGE` was refused, COBOLNET0899, at every edition).
      *>
      *> THE RULES (ISO/IEC 1989:2023).
      *> §13.18.35.2 Format 1 — the operand is `integer-1 [ON NEXT PAGE]`, `{PLUS|+} integer-2` or a bare
      *>   `ON NEXT PAGE` (the three-way brace, rendered from the printed page).
      *> §13.18.35.4 GR4 — a body group other than "the chronologically first body group since the execution
      *>   of an INITIATE statement" takes a page fit test, and a) "If the first LINE clause has a NEXT PAGE
      *>   phrase, no page fit test takes place and the page fit is declared unsuccessful." "Which LINE clause is
      *>   taken to be the first may depend on the current values of conditions in PRESENT WHEN clauses."
      *> §13.18.35.4 GR5 a) — an absolute first line is printed at integer-1; "If in addition the NEXT PAGE phrase
      *>   is present and the report group is a report footing, the first line is printed beginning on a new
      *>   page." GR5 b) 3. — the first body group on a page begins at the FIRST DETAIL integer.
      *> §13.18.37.4 GR4 a) 2. — after an absolute NEXT GROUP filled the save location, a next body group that
      *>   begins "with an absolute LINE clause with the NEXT PAGE phrase" takes a page advance, the save
      *>   location moves to LINE-COUNTER, and it is then processed "as for an identical report group without
      *>   the NEXT PAGE phrase". ONE advance: the one the save location forces (docs/CONFORMANCE.md).
      *> §13.18.57.4 GR6 b) — no page heading before "a report footing on a page by itself"; GR6 f) 2. — no page
      *>   footing "on the last page, if it is occupied only by a report footing group"; GR7 f) — the upper
      *>   limit of such a footing is the HEADING integer (where the bare form, which writes no integer, begins
      *>   — a determination, docs/CONFORMANCE.md).
      *> §8.4.3.15.4 GR2/GR3 — each page advance adds 1 to PAGE-COUNTER and zeroes LINE-COUNTER.
      *>
      *> REPORT R-NP: PAGE LIMIT 12, HEADING 1, FIRST DETAIL 3, LAST DETAIL 9, FOOTING 10 (§13.18.39).
      *> DERIVATION (LC = LINE-COUNTER, PC = PAGE-COUNTER; INITIATE: LC 0, PC 1):
      *>  1 GENERATE DE-N (the first GENERATE): PH line 1 "PH1". DE-N is the chronologically first body group
      *>    — no page fit test, so NO advance despite NEXT PAGE (GR4): line 5 "N05", line 6 "n06". LC 6.
      *>  2 GENERATE DE-A: fit 6 + 1 = 7 <= 9 -> line 7 "A07".
      *>  3 GENERATE DE-N: NEXT PAGE -> fit unsuccessful (GR4 a)) -> page advance: PF at FOOTING + 1 = 11
      *>    "PF1"; PC 2; PH "PH2"; line 5 "N05", line 6 "n06".
      *>  4 GENERATE DE-B (bare NEXT PAGE): advance: PF "PF2"; PC 3; PH "PH3"; the first body group on the page
      *>    -> FIRST DETAIL 3 (GR5 b) 3.) "B03", then "b04". LC 4.
      *>  5 WS-FLAG "N", GENERATE DE-P: its NEXT PAGE line is ABSENT, so the relative line is the first: trial
      *>    4 + 1 = 5 <= 9 -> fits, line 5 "p05" on THIS page.
      *>  6 WS-FLAG "Y", GENERATE DE-P: the NEXT PAGE line is present and first -> advance: PF "PF3"; PC 4;
      *>    PH "PH4"; line 6 "P06", line 7 "p07".
      *>  7 GENERATE DE-G: fit 7 + 1 = 8 -> line 8 "G08". NEXT GROUP 4: LC 8 is not below 4, so 4 goes to the
      *>    save location and LC = FOOTING 10.
      *>  8 GENERATE DE-N: the save location's advance: PF "PF4"; PC 5; PH "PH5". GR4 a) 2.: LC = 4, and the
      *>    phrase-less fit test 5 > 4 succeeds -> line 5 "N05", line 6 "n06" on page 5 (no second advance).
      *>  9 TERMINATE: PF "PF5" on page 5; the RF begins a new page: PC 6, no PH; line 4 "RF6"; no PF after it.
      *>
      *> REPORT R-BF: PAGE LIMIT 6, HEADING 2, FIRST DETAIL 3. DE-X: first body group -> FIRST DETAIL 3 "X03".
      *>  TERMINATE: the RF's bare NEXT PAGE -> new page, PC 2, first line at HEADING 2 "RF2", then "r03".
      *>
      *> THE READ-BACK numbers every physical line of each page (the PB484 byte reader) and shows each form
      *> feed as a PAGE marker.
