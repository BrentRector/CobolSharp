      *> kb/Work PB1019 -- ADDRESS OF a program's own LINKAGE formal.
      *> ISO 8.4.3.11.3 SR1: identifier-1 "shall reference a data item
      *> defined in the file section, working-storage section,
      *> local-storage section, or linkage section"; 8.4.3.11.4 GR1: the
      *> result "contains the address of identifier-1".  A formal passed
      *> BY REFERENCE operates "as if the formal parameter occupies the
      *> same storage area as the argument" (14.2.3 GR8), so a store
      *> through a BASED item addressed at the formal reaches the caller's
      *> argument; a BY CONTENT argument's copy absorbs it (14.2.3 GR9).
      *> The third leg: a GLOBAL formal addressed from a contained program.
