      *> kb/Work PB511 — the BELOW-INTRODUCTION half. The EXTERNAL clause's `AS literal-1` is the shared
      *> externalizedNamePhrase, and that phrase is a COBOL-2002 introduction: X3.23-1985 prints it in no
      *> general format and makes AS a user-definable word (the user-word-as-2002 twin). So at --std 85 this

      *> BOTH ARMS ARE WRITTEN HERE ON PURPOSE (§13.4.5.2 Formats 1/2/3 and §13.16.2 Format 1 print the same
      *> `[ IS EXTERNAL [ AS literal-1 ] ]` slot): the FD arm and the data-description arm are one clause,
      *> and a gate that reached only one of them would be the repo's two-arm defect shape again.
