      *> in the ALPHABET clause, if any." The set is not empty any more - owner decision kb/Work PB793 added
      *> ASCII and EBCDIC as code-name-1 - so this golden names a code-name that is NOT in it. FIELDATA is a
      *> real historical coded character set (the 6-bit UNIVAC/military code) and exactly the kind of spelling
      *> another vendor might support; here it is a source error, and the diagnostic names the supported set.

      *> An unsupported code-name used to be reinterpreted as a LITERAL PHRASE SPELLING OUT ITS OWN LETTERS:
      *> the alphabet's first four positions became F, I, E, L, and every downstream reference read that
      *> (kb/Work PB770 leg e). A bare word is not a literal at all (SR14 b2), so the literal-phrase reading was
      *> never available to fall back on. CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-184 carries the statement of the supported set.
