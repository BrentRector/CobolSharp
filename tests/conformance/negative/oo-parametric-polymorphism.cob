*> ISO 9.3.5.3 "Parametric polymorphism, sometimes called method overloading, allows methods within a class
*> to have the same method name, differing in the number and type of parameters"; rule 7 makes it OPTIONAL
*> and Annex A.4.10 item 3 lists it. COBOL.NET does not claim it: two METHOD-IDs of one name in one class
*> are refused by name with COBOLNET0822.
*> This is the FIRST fixture for 0822 - the diagnostic shipped with no negative at all, and its message
*> cited "ISO 12063", which is not a clause of ISO/IEC 1989:2023 (a stray line anchor;
*> DESIGN-SPEC-RECONCILIATION finding 44). The citation is repaired in the same change set.
