*> ISO 13.18.43.3 SR9, SR5's twin one general format over: "Integer-5 shall be
*> greater than integer-4", of the Format 3 clause RECORD CONTAINS integer-4 TO
*> integer-5. The clause states 20 TO 5.
*> !! FORMAT 3 HAS NO SR4-ANALOGUE, and that is why this case is here as well as the
*> Format 2 one: 13.18.43.4 GR18 says that for this format "the size of each record
*> is completely defined in the record description entry", so the standard states no
*> rule bounding the record descriptions by integer-4 and integer-5, and SR9 is the
*> ONLY thing that can catch an inverted Format 3 range. F-REC's 10 bytes draw
*> nothing, deliberately - a screen that also reported the record here would be
*> enforcing a rule the standard does not state. kb/Work PB721.
