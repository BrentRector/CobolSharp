*> kb/Work PB443 - ISO 14.9.37.3 SR11: "When a data-name in the KEY phrase ... is referenced or when a
*> condition-name associated with a data-name in the KEY phrase ... is referenced, all preceding
*> data-names in that KEY phrase or their associated condition-names shall also be referenced." The KEY
*> phrase is ASCENDING K1 K2, so K1 is the more significant key (13.18.38.4 GR3) and a WHEN that names
*> only K2's condition-name skips it. The screen used to pick a level-88 by BASE WORD with the tie broken
*> by declaration order, ignoring the OF qualifier the condition BINDER honours, so it credited this WHEN
*> with referencing K1 and reported nothing; 8.4.2.2 Format 2 decides which 88 a reference names, and it
*> is now decided in the one place (ConditionBinder.ConditionOf).
