*> kb/Work PB923 — the refusing half. 14.8.2.3.3 rule 2 a): "If the formal parameter is numeric, the conformance
*> rules are the same as for a COMPUTE statement with the argument as the sending operand and the corresponding
*> formal parameter as the receiving operand." A COMPUTE sender shall be numeric (8.8.1.1), so an ALPHANUMERIC
*> function-identifier into a numeric formal stays refused (COBOLNET0844, the 8.8.1.1 arithmetic-operand screen) while the same function into an
*> alphanumeric formal now takes rule 2 d)'s MOVE lane. The lane is chosen by the FORMAL, as rule 2 chooses it.
