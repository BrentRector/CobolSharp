      *> never stand beside an ADDRESS OF receiver - MEASURED before the landing,
      *> `SET ADDRESS OF B1 P-PLAIN TO P-RESTRICTED` was `error COBOL0001: unexpected 'P-PLAIN'`.  Here the
      *> sender's restriction comes from D.9.2.2 source 1 instead - 13.18.60.4 GR23, "If type-name-1 is
      *> specified, this data item is a restricted data-pointer" (cite.py --check 13.18.60.4 -> OK 23)) - which
      *> is the arm the diagnostic's parenthetical now names.
      *> The FIRST receiving operand is a conforming `ADDRESS OF B1` over a TYPE TT based item, so the only
      *> thing this case can be rejected for is the SECOND one (feedback_green_gates_arent_evidence).
      *> Below 2002 the whole family draws the introduction gate instead (COBOLNET0900 on TYPEDEF), which is
      *> why reject-at names 2002 and up.
