      *> reject-at: 85
      *> kb/Work PB668, COBOLNET2210. REVERSED establishes the BACKWARD
      *> retrieval of ISO 14.9.30.4 GR21 c), which only a positionable
      *> record ordinal on a RECORD sequential medium supports, so the
      *> phrase is admitted for record sequential organization alone -
      *> one step narrower than its sibling WITH NO REWIND, whose
      *> 14.9.27.3 SR5 reaches both sequential kinds via 9.1.7.2 (the
      *> witness there is pb317-open-norewind-relative). The file below
      *> is RELATIVE, which SR5 also excludes, so the two phrases agree
      *> here and differ only on LINE SEQUENTIAL - and that difference
      *> is unreachable from conforming source at every edition, since
      *> LINE SEQUENTIAL arrived in 2023 (COBOLNET0900) and REVERSED was
      *> deleted in 2002 (COBOLNET0902). It is defence in depth under
      *> --permissive, which is why the screen tests the organization
      *> and not merely "not sequential".
      *> reject-at is 85 ALONE because at 2002 and later the phrase is
      *> refused first, by the open-reversed-removed-2002 edition gate
      *> (COBOLNET0902, VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE row 7.12) - so this
      *> syntax rule has exactly one edition at which it can be seen.
