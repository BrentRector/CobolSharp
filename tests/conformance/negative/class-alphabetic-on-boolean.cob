*> ISO 8.8.4.4.3 SR4, as written: "ALPHABETIC, ALPHABETIC-LOWER, ALPHABETIC-UPPER, or class-name-1
*> shall not be specified if the category of the data item referenced by identifier-1 is boolean,
*> numeric, or numeric-edited." W-B is category boolean, so the ALPHABETIC alternative is refused.
*> ⚠ The .err pins SR4's OWN WORDS, not a paraphrase of the boolean third of them: COBOLNET0844 used
*> to say "shall not be specified for a boolean operand" because the screen tested only that one of
*> the three categories the rule names (kb/Work PB571 — the class-condition table landing broadened
*> it to the rule as written, and this case is the one that pinned the narrow wording).
