*> reject-at: 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.32.4 general rule 4 a): RELEASE record-name-1 FROM literal-1 is "MOVE literal-1
*> TO record-name-1 according to the rules specified for the MOVE statement".  The rules specified
*> for the MOVE statement include the 14.9.25.3 SR5 restriction on an alphanumeric figurative sender
*> to a numeric receiver, which Annex F.2 records as REMOVED at COBOL-2023 -- so the implicit move
*> is removed exactly as the explicit one is, and the program is refused (COBOLNET0902).
*> The EDITION half of kb/Work PB348.  At 2023 the explicit `MOVE QUOTE TO SRT-NUM` errored while
*> `RELEASE SRT-NUM FROM QUOTE` compiled with NO DIAGNOSTIC AT ALL: "according to the rules
*> specified for the MOVE statement" was applied at no edition, because the implicit move was
*> constructed after binding and no version-conformance pass could see it.  Its positive twin is
*> conformance:2002/pb348_release_from_figurative_image, where the same statement is valid and runs.
