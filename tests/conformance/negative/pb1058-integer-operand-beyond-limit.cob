      *> AN INTEGER-N BEYOND THE IMPLEMENTATION LIMIT (kb/Work PB1058). COBOL.NET
      *> binds the integer-n of a data description (a PAGE or LINAGE line count,
      *> a COLUMN, an OCCURS size) into its own model as a 32-bit integer, so a
      *> value above 2,147,483,647 is beyond this implementation's limit —
      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §4.5: "Translation may be unsuccessful due to factors
      *> other than lack of conformance of a compilation group", and its NOTE
      *> names "the limits of an implementation" (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §3
      *> "Integer operands and host carriers"). Before PB1058 each of these took
      *> the COMPILER down with an unhandled System.OverflowException out of
      *> int.Parse; now each is COBOLNET2427 at every edition (the report writer
      *> and LINAGE are COBOL-85 syntax).
