*> reject-at: 2023
*> Annex A.4.3 item 3, the USE arm, on the THIRD name of the family - EC-FLOW-APPLY-COMMIT. Its own witness
*> because the table entry that refuses it is a LONGER prefix than EC-FLOW-COMMIT's: a prefix table whose
*> rows shadowed one another would still fire here, but with the wrong facility text, so the message the
*> harness matches is the code and the reasoning is recorded in the table.
*> NOTE the standard writes EC-FLOW-APPLY (no -COMMIT suffix) at 9.1.18.7 and 12.4.6.3.4 GR3/GR4, a name
*> that has NO row in the 14.6.13.1.6 table at all - a defect in the standard, reported not worked around.
