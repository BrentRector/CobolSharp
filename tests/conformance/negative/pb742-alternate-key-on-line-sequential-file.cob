*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.2 SR8 sentence 1, over the OTHER Format-1 key clause and over the OTHER
*> sequential phrase. The ALTERNATE RECORD KEY clause is Format 1's alone (12.4.5.1), and LINE
*> SEQUENTIAL is a sequential organization (12.4.5.10.3 GR3), not an indexed one. The alternate
*> clause is screened per CLAUSE AS WRITTEN, so the rule fires on a clause whose data-name resolves
*> perfectly well - the violation is the clause's presence, not its operand.
*> ⚠ LINE SEQUENTIAL is a COBOL-2023 introduction as an ORGANIZATION phrase in this compiler, but
*> the file control entry is still rejected at every edition here because SR8 is what refuses it and
*> the below-2023 editions add their own introduction gate on top; the reject-at header names all
*> four because the case must be REFUSED at all four, whichever rule speaks first.
