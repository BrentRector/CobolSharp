*> ISO §8.4.3.14.3 SR1 — "LINAGE-COUNTER may be referenced only in procedure division statements." A file
*> description entry is not a procedure division statement, so `FD LPG LINAGE IS LINAGE-COUNTER OF LPF LINES`
*> is not a legal reference to the register. §13.18.34.4 GR7 b) says the same thing from the other side, and
*> the general format agrees independently: §13.18.34.2 prints data-name-1, a qualified-data-name
*> (§8.4.2.2.2 Format 1), while LINAGE-COUNTER is an IDENTIFIER — §8.4.3.1 Format 10, qualified-linage-counter.
*> ⛔ THIS COMPILED CLEAN until kb/Work PB489 and died at OPEN with "LINAGE operand 'LPF' is not resolvable to
