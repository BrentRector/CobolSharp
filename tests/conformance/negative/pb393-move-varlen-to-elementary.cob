      *> kb/Work PB393. ISO 1989:2023 14.9.25.3 SR9: "If identifier-1 or identifier-2 references a
      *> variable-length group then these groups shall be compatible groups as specified in 8.5.1.12,
      *> Variable-length groups." 8.5.1.12.1 states the prohibition over the OTHER operand - a variable-length
      *> group "is not equivalent to an alphanumeric data item and may not undergo a comparison or a move
      *> operation, in either direction, explicitly or otherwise, unless the other operand is a compatible
      *> group" - so an ELEMENTARY receiving item can never be that other operand, whatever its size.
      *> Without this screen the program compiled clean and aborted the run unit inside a Tier-C image guard:

      *> The DYNAMIC LENGTH clause is COBOL-2014, so the shape cannot be written below that edition.
