*> THE CLAUSE IS RECOGNIZED WHOLE, not merely up to the SOURCE token - which is the property the generic
*> parse error could not have, and the reason this fixture is not a duplicate of pb358-alternate-key-source.
*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.6.2's general format continues past the key-form brace group with two bracketed
*> phrases, [ WITH DUPLICATES ] and [ SUPPRESS WHEN literal-1 ] (printed page 350, folio 320, RENDERED).
*> Before 2026-09-09 the parser lost its place at SOURCE and then reported a SECOND unexpected-token error
*> at WITH - two diagnostics for one clause, neither of them naming the actual disposition. With the SOURCE
*> arm parsed, the trailing DUPLICATES phrase is consumed by the same clause and exactly ONE diagnostic is
*> produced: the named Annex A.3 item 40 decline.
*> WITH is an optional word here (un-underlined; only DUPLICATES carries a rule), so this spelling exercises
*> the full phrase. SUPPRESS WHEN is deliberately NOT written: it is a COBOL-2023 addition gated by
*> COBOLNET0900 below 2023 (constructs.json row alternate-key-suppress-when-2023), and a fixture rejecting
*> at all four editions must not depend on which of two codes arrives first.
