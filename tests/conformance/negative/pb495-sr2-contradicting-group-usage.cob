*> kb/Work PB495 — ISO 13.18.60.3 SR2: "If the USAGE clause is written in the data description entry for a
*> group item, it may also be written in the data description entry for any subordinate elementary item or
*> group item, but the same usage shall be specified in both entries." B writes USAGE DISPLAY inside a group
*> that wrote USAGE COMPUTATIONAL, so the two entries do not specify the same usage and the source is
*> nonconforming at every edition (COMPUTATIONAL, DISPLAY and the group-level USAGE clause are all COBOL-85).
*> The rule had NO site in the compiler before PB495: the nearer clause simply won and the outer one was
*> discarded in silence, so B bound as a 4-byte DISPLAY item and the group measured 6 bytes where the
*> conforming spelling gives 4 -- a width no written clause asked for, which a REDEFINES window, a record
*> image or a CALL boundary would then key on.
