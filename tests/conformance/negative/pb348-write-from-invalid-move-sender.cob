*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.51.3 syntax rule 6: "If record-name-1 is specified, identifier-1 or literal-1
*> shall be valid as a sending operand in a MOVE statement specifying record-name-1 as the receiving
*> operand."  The WRITE twin of the RELEASE case: a PIC 9(3) sender into a PIC A(8) record is

*> It is a SEPARATE fixture from its RELEASE sibling because the two verbs reached the same
*> inspection-free operand binder from different call sites, and the repo's most reproducible defect
*> shape is a dispatch with two arms of which only one is ever fixed.
