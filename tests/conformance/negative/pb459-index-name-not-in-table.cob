*> ISO 1989:2023 8.4.2.3.3 syntax rule 4 - "Index-name-1 shall correspond to a data description entry in the
*> hierarchy of the table being referenced that contains an INDEXED BY phrase specifying that index-name."
*> IX1 is the index of T1; E2 is an element of T2. The reference E2 (IX1) therefore names no occurrence of
*> the table it subscripts, and the rule is a SYNTAX rule, so it is a compile-time diagnostic at every
*> edition - 8.4.2.3.3 SR4 is unchanged text from COBOL-85 onward.
*>
*> kb/Work PB459: 14.9.39.4 GR1 exists so the rest of the SET clause can say "that table" ("Index-names are
*> associated with a given table by being specified in the INDEXED BY phrase of the OCCURS clause for that
*> table"), and the association WAS built - DataItem.IndexNames - but outside SEARCH nothing read it. So this
*> program compiled clean and wrote 77 through an unrelated table's occurrence number, with no diagnostic at
*> any stage and no run-time symptom either.
*>
*> Refused in BOTH dialect lanes (strict and --permissive), and the diagnostic says why: the reference has a
*> perfectly computable occurrence number, so accepting it under a leniency would silently read or write the
*> wrong table element. There is no coercion to offer that is not a wrong answer.
*>
*> The SET on the line above is the CONTROL and must NOT be diagnosed: 14.9.39.4 GR2 a) 3. b/c make
*> SET IX1 TO IX2 - an index-name of one table set from an index-name of another - legal, and GR2 a) 1. c
*> ends "even if that occurrence is not a valid occurrence within this table". Only the SUBSCRIPT is refused.
