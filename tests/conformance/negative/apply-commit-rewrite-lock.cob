*> reject-at: 2023
*> THE WITNESS FOR SR-14.9.35.3-5, one of the seven vacuously-satisfied rules kb/Work PB371 raised (owner
*> decision 2026-09-02: CONFORMS, witnessed by the refusal of the antecedent).
*> THE RULE (ISO 14.9.35.3 SR5): "If the rewrite file is subject to an APPLY COMMIT clause, neither the WITH
*> LOCK phrase nor the WITH NO LOCK phrase shall be specified."
*> REWRITE and its lock phrases are CLAIMED; the APPLY COMMIT clause is Annex A.4.3 item 2 and is refused by
*> name (COBOLNET1709), so no compilable program reaches the antecedent.
*> ⚠ A DIFFERENT A.4 DECLINE LIVES IN THE SAME STATEMENT and is NOT what this fixture pins: REWRITE's FILE
*> phrase is Annex A.4.13 item 2 and draws COBOLNET1706. This fixture writes `REWRITE record-name`, the
*> mandatory alternative, so the only decline it can draw is the APPLY COMMIT clause's.
