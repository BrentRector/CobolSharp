      *> reject-at: 2002 2014 2023
      *> ISO §15.58.3 rule 1 — "Argument-1 shall be a data item of category numeric or numeric-edited and
      *> shall not be an integer function or numeric function." FOUR violations, one for each clause of the
      *> rule; every one draws COBOLNET1516.
      *>   (a) AN PIC X(5) — category alphanumeric (§8.5.2.1 Table 2), neither category the rule admits.
      *>   (b) FUNCTION LENGTH — "The type of this function is integer" (§15.50.1): an INTEGER FUNCTION.
      *>   (c) FUNCTION ABS over a NON-integer numeric argument — §15.7.1's type table gives function type
      *>       Numeric for a Numeric argument (Integer only for an Integer one): a NUMERIC FUNCTION.
      *>   (d) FUNCTION L1-LOWFN — a user-defined function's returned value. The exclusion has to be WRITTEN
      *>       because §8.5.2.12 items 6/7 put "a numeric function" and "an integer function" in category
      *>       numeric, so the category half alone would admit exactly what the second half forbids.
      *> ⚠ TWO-ARM NOTE: conformance:negative/algebraic-udf-argument pins (d) for the HIGHEST-ALGEBRAIC twin
      *> (§15.43.3 r1) only. The LOWEST-ALGEBRAIC arm of the same rule had no fixture of its own.
      *> The ADMIT side is conformance:2023/l1_lowest_algebraic_value_rule (one numeric and two
      *> numeric-edited arguments folding), so a compiler that refused every argument would fail there while
      *> passing here.
      *> reject-at omits 85: LOWEST-ALGEBRAIC is not one of the 1989 Intrinsic Function Module's functions,
      *> so below 2002 the reference is rejected by the introduction gate instead — a different rule.
