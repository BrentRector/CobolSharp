*> ISO 13.18.60.3 SR14 reached through 13.18.60.4 GR1 - THE DERIVED CONSEQUENCE. GR1: "If the USAGE
*> clause is specified or implied at a group level, it applies only to each elementary item in the
*> group." So G's POINTER phrase applies to A and B, each at level 05 and subordinate to an ordinary
*> group - SR14 violations both. The verdict is reported ONCE, at the entry carrying the clause.
*>
*> This fixture is also the arm the FIRST build of the screen silently missed: DataItem.IsGroup is
*> `Pic is null && Children.Count > 0`, and ParseUsage synthesizes a pointer profile onto the header
*> before its subordinates are known, so an IsGroup-keyed test waved G through and then blessed it as
*> "a level-1 elementary pointer". The subject test is the spec's own notion instead - an entry with
*> subordinates is a group (8.5.1.3.2).
