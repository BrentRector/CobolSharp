      *> ISO §14.9.35.3 SR4 — WITH NO LOCK on a REWRITE of a file whose
      *> LOCK MODE clause specifies AUTOMATIC.
      *> "If automatic locking has been specified for the rewrite file,
      *> neither the WITH LOCK phrase nor the WITH NO LOCK phrase shall
      *> be specified."
      *> cite.py: OK  §14.9.35.3 4)  (Syntax rules)
      *> cite.py: OK  §12.4.5.9.4 4)  (General rules) - "If the
      *> AUTOMATIC phrase is specified, the lock mode is automatic."
      *> The LOCK MODE clause and the lock phrase are COBOL 2002
      *> facilities, so the rejection applies from 2002 on. The file is
      *> INDEXED with sequential access and a SHARING clause; the only
      *> defect is the lock phrase against automatic locking (the WITH
      *> LOCK spelling of the same violation is covered by the same
      *> check and is not repeated). No APPLY COMMIT clause (SR5).
