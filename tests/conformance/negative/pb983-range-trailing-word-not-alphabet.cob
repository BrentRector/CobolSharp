      *> ISO 14.9.13.2: IN is an optional word in the range-expression's `[ IN alphabet-name-1 ]` (not
      *> underlined; 5.2.3), so a bare word after a THROUGH range's right-hand operand is in the
      *> alphabet-name-1 position. NO-SUCH-ALPHA declares no alphabet (12.3.7), so 14.9.13.3 SR3's
      *> alphabet-name-1 names nothing and 14.7.8 rule 2's "collating sequence defined by that alphabet" has
      *> nothing to resolve to - refused, never read as the native order (kb/Work PB983).
