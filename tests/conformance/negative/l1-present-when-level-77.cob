      *> 77 is a noncontiguous elementary item (§13.16.3 SR1 admits
      *> "77 or 1 through 49", SR2 requires the data-name format of the

      *> §13.16.2 Format 1's `[ validation-clauses ]` group is the only
      *> place a data description entry can carry PRESENT WHEN, and
      *> that clause (§13.18.41 format 2) is item 5 of Annex A.4.14
      *> (VALIDATE), an optional element whose support this
      *> implementation does not claim (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §5). Annex
      *> A.4.1 admits the syntax of an optional element only when
      *> support is claimed, so the clause is refused BY NAME with
      *> COBOLNET1708 in EVERY data description entry — 77 included.
      *> The antecedent SR20 forbids can therefore never be constructed
      *> and the prohibition cannot be violated: kb/Work PB371's landed

      *> ⛔ AND IT STOPS PASSING THE DAY THE ROW NEEDS RE-ADJUDICATING.
      *> kb/Work PB283 (the A.4.14 posture) is OPEN. If VALIDATE is
      *> ever claimed, the clause is admitted and this 77 entry must
      *> then be diagnosed on SR20's own ground rather than by the
      *> decline; COBOLNET1708 stops being the answer and this fixture
      *> goes red.
