*> ISO 8.5.1.12.1 RULE 1 / 8.5.1.12.2 sentence 2 - the first of the three compatibility conditions
*> (kb/Work PB204). "For each dynamic-capacity table in either group there is a corresponding table in the
*> other group", and "two tables correspond if AT LEAST ONE OF THEM IS A DYNAMIC-CAPACITY TABLE and they
*> occupy the same relative byte positions within their groups". VT is a dynamic-capacity table at relative
*> byte position 2; LQ at that position is not a table at all, so no correspondence exists and 14.8.2.2
*> refuses the crossing. Rule 1's own witness, distinct from rule 2's (pb204-nested-vlg-element-width, where
*> the tables DO correspond and fail to MATCH) and rule 3's (pb204-nested-vlg-position).
