*> PB10 - a FUNCTION-IDENTIFIER as INSPECT identifier-1 in Format 2 (REPLACING).
*> 8.4.3.1.2 Format 1 makes a function-identifier an IDENTIFIER, so INSPECT identifier-1 admits one - but only
*> where it is SENDING. 14.9.22.4 GR1 concedes only that "for purposes of determining its length, identifier-1
*> is treated as a sending data item", a SCOPED concession that would be unnecessary if it were generally
*> sending. GR7 replaces matched characters IN identifier-1, so it is a RECEIVING operand.
*> 8.4.3.2.3 SR1: "A function-identifier shall not be specified as a receiving operand."
*> The SENDING format (Format 1, TALLYING only) IS legal and is pinned by the positive golden
*> conformance:2023/pb10_function_identifier_sending.
