      *> switch-name-1, feature-name-1, and device-name-1."  COBOL.NET specifies them in ONE table
      *> (Binding/ImplementorNames.cs; docs/CONFORMANCE.md section 7, A.1 items 189/190/191) and CONSOEL is not
      *> one of them.  Before the table this entry compiled and registered PRT as the mnemonic of a device
      *> named CONSOEL; the typo surfaced only at the DISPLAY that used it, as a device "not capable of
      *> receiving data" - and a program that declared the entry but never used it compiled clean.  The
      *> refusal is now at the DECLARATION, by name: COBOLNET2241.
