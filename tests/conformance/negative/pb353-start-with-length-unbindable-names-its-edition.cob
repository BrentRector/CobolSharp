      *> reject-at: 85
      *> kb/Work PB353. An edition gate keyed on a BOUND NODE'S SHAPE is silently un-gated on every path
      *> that bails out before the node is built: a written construct's PARSE node is always present, but
      *> the bound node it would have produced is dropped (BoundUnsupported / BoundNop) the moment the
      *> binder refuses the statement, so an introduction gate must fire on RECOGNITION. Each program in
      *> this family violates a SECOND rule as well, so the binder refuses it before the bound node exists;
      *> a per-edition compiler must still name the edition of the post-85 construct that was WRITTEN.
      *> Measured before the fix: each of these reported its other error ALONE at --std 85.
      *> HERE: 14.9.41.2 prints the phrase as its own bracket, [ WITH LENGTH arithmetic-expression-1 ],
      *> and 14.9.41.3 SR8 ("If the LENGTH phrase is specified, file-name-1 shall reference a file with
      *> indexed organization") is a SEPARATE syntax rule the binder reports on its own - not the
      *> introduction. The KEY operand resolves to nothing, so BindStart returns a BoundUnsupported
      *> before BoundKeyedStart.Length is ever assigned. The WITH LENGTH phrase is still written.
