*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ⛔ LINE-COUNTER IS THE HALF OF §8.4.3.15 THE STANDARD TAKES AWAY (kb/Work PB429).
*> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §8.4.3.15.3 SR1 admits BOTH report counters wherever an integer data item may appear:
*> "In the procedure division, PAGE-COUNTER and LINE-COUNTER may be referenced in any context where an
*> integer data item may appear." SR3 then removes exactly one of them from one position:
*> "LINE-COUNTER shall not be referenced as a receiving operand."
*>
*> This is the COMPLEMENT of conformance:85/pb429_page_counter_receiving, and it is what makes that golden
*> mean something: the two counters travel the same grammar, the same resolver and the same receiving
*> chokepoint, so a compiler that admitted PAGE-COUNTER by weakening the receiving screen would admit this
*> too. The rule is edition-invariant — the counters and SR3 are in the '85 standard unchanged — so every
*> edition rejects.
*>
*> ⚠ THE CODE IS THE POINT AS MUCH AS THE REJECTION. The refusal used to be emitted as COBOLNET0899, the
*> "recognized but not implemented" band, which tells the reader their LEGAL program is unsupported when in
*> fact their program is illegal; it now carries its own rule code, COBOLNET2197.
