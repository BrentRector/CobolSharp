      *> ISO §14.9.28.3 SR11: "When procedure-name-1 and procedure-name-2 are both specified and either is the
      *> name of a procedure in the declaratives portion of the procedure division, both shall be
      *> procedure-names in the same declarative section." Unchanged since X3.23-1985, so every --std rejects.
      *>
      *> HALF 2 of the rule (kb/Work PB433) — the QUIET half, and the one a "reject when one end is declarative
      *> and the other is not" screen would leave open: BOTH names are in the declaratives portion, but in two
      *> DIFFERENT declarative sections. Accepted, this ran and printed N=0011, silently executing a range that
      *> spans two USE procedures with different dispatch conditions (D-SEC1 is the error procedure for F1,
      *> D-SEC2 for F2). The witness for that half is here, beside the loud one, because one predicate decides
      *> both: the two ends shall be procedures of the SAME declarative section.
