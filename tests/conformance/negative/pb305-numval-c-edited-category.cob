*> kb/Work PB305 - THE CLASS PROJECTION MUST NOT LEAK INTO A CATEGORY-WORDED RULE.
*> 15.68.3 is the one function in the catalogue that asks BOTH questions of the same operand: r1 is
*> CATEGORY-worded - "Argument-1 shall be of category alphanumeric or national" - while r2 is CLASS-worded -
*> "Argument-2, if specified, shall be of the same class as argument-1". 8.5.2.1's closing sentence is what
*> keeps them apart: "Use of the name of a data class or data category in the rules of COBOL refers to the
*> category unless class is specifically indicated."
*> So a PIC ZZ9 item, whose CATEGORY is numeric-edited and whose CLASS is alphanumeric, is admitted by r2's
*> class test and REFUSED by r1's category test - and the refusal is the one that must survive. Before
*> PB305 this program was rejected TWICE, once correctly on the category and once on a class disagreement
*> that 8.5.2.1 Table 2 says does not exist; the class complaint is gone and the category one remains.
