      *> kb/Work PB829 - the CLOSED ISO 12.4.5.1 general format.  ONE grammar rule -
      *> `genericClause : IDENTIFIER (IDENTIFIER|literal)*`, described in the grammar as a
      *> "vendor/extension hook" - was wired into SIX sites spanning EIGHT closed general formats, and
      *> every one of them swallowed any word run the format does not define, at every edition and every
      *> strictness, with no diagnostic anywhere.  This program compiled CLEAN and RAN, with WIBBLE simply
      *> discarded.  ISO 4.2.2 makes a general format the definition of what may be written ("An
      *> implementation shall provide a warning mechanism ... to indicate violations of the general formats
      *> and the explicit syntax rules of standard COBOL"), so the word is now NAMED: COBOLNET1970.
      *> The 12.4.5.1 clause list was RENDERED from the printed page (PDF p342-344 / folios 312-314) before it was
      *> closed - closing a list against the lossy OCR diagram would REJECT LEGAL SOURCE, which is strictly
      *> worse than the silence it replaces.
      *> Rejected at 85 as well as 2023: the general format is a closed list in every edition of the
      *> standard, and neither WIBBLE nor WOBBLE is a reserved word at any of them.
