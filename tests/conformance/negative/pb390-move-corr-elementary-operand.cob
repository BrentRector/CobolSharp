*> kb/Work PB390 - ISO 14.9.25.3 SR12's FIRST half, at MOVE: "Identifier-3 and identifier-4 shall specify
*> group data items and shall not be reference-modified." ELEM is elementary. The half was already decided
*> at bind (kb/Work PB236 moved the CORRESPONDING group screen there) but only the ADD spelling had a
*> negative case - `grep -rln "MOVE CORR" tests/conformance/negative/` returned nothing - so SR12's row was
*> being asked to close on a test of 14.9.2.3 SR6. This is the MOVE case, and it sits beside
*> pb390-move-corr-reference-modified, which is the same sentence's second half.
