      *> kb/Work PB843. `WS-LO THRU WS-HI IN AL` - the trailing IN AL names an ALPHABET (8.3.2.2: a word is
      *> only one type of user-defined word, so it is not a qualifier), so it is 14.9.13.2's
      *> `[ IN alphabet-name-1 ]` phrase and 14.9.13.3 SR3 governs it: "Alphabet-name-1 may be specified only
      *> when the literals or identifiers specified in the THROUGH phrase are of class alphabetic,
      *> alphanumeric, or national." WS-LO and WS-HI are numeric. Before PB843 the phrase was read as a
      *> qualifier and the verdict was COBOLNET1639 on 'WS-HIINAL' - the phrase's own rule never ran.
