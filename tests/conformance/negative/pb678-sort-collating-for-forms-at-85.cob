*> reject-at: 85
*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.40.2 - the SORT/MERGE COLLATING SEQUENCE phrase's FOR ALPHANUMERIC /
*> FOR NATIONAL forms (and the bare alphabet-name-2 second word) are COBOL-2002 introductions:
*> alphabet-name-2 exists to name the sequence for keys of class NATIONAL (14.9.40.3 SR2 +
*> 14.9.40.4 GR5a) and the national class arrived in 2002. At --std 85 the version-conformance
*> pass rejects on recognition (COBOLNET0872).
*>
*> THIS CASE EXISTS BECAUSE THE GATE BECAME LOAD-BEARING (kb/Work PB678). Until PB678 the binder
*> resolved and validated alphabet-name-2 and then THREW IT AWAY, so the gate guarded nothing an
*> execution could observe; now the resolved sequence reaches the key comparator, and this is the
*> only thing standing between a COBOL-85 compilation and a 2002 phrase. The key here is
*> deliberately ALPHANUMERIC so 0872 is the ONLY verdict - a national key would also draw the
*> national-class gate and hide which rule did the rejecting.
