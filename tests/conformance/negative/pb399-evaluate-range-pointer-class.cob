      *> ISO §14.9.13.3 SR4 names FOUR classes a range-expression's operands may not be of: "The two
      *> operands in a range-expression shall be of the same class and shall not be of class boolean,
      *> message-tag, object, or pointer."  This range's ends are USAGE POINTER items, class pointer by
      *> §8.5.2.1 Table 2.
      *>
      *> The exclusion has teeth of its own: a range lowers to `selection-subject >= left-part AND
      *> selection-subject <= right-part` (§14.9.13.4 GR4 a) 5.) and §8.8.4.2.2 Format 3 prints no ordering
      *> operator at all for a message-tag/object/pointer relation, so the lowering has no comparison to
      *> mean.  Before this screen the compiler emitted it anyway and ORDERED RAW ADDRESSES (kb/Work PB399).
      *> USAGE POINTER is a COBOL-2002 introduction, so the case is written from 2002 up.
