*> reject-at: 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 14.9.4.3 SR22 - "If identifier-4 or its corresponding formal parameter is specified with a BY VALUE
*> phrase, identifier-4 shall be of class numeric, object, or pointer." GnuCOBOL accepts an alphanumeric
*> operand as an extension and silently assumes BY CONTENT - a DIFFERENT passing mode from the one written.
*> Surfaced by the pre-merge differential: this was already rejected, but by DA6's 8.8.1.1 ARITHMETIC screen,
*> because the grammar production is named arithmeticExpression. Right verdict, wrong rule quoted.
*> (BY VALUE is a COBOL-2002 introduction, so 85 rejects this earlier for a different reason.)
*> PROG2 is CONTAINED because AS NESTED requires it - 14.9.4.3 SR15 sentence 2 fires first otherwise (PB131).
