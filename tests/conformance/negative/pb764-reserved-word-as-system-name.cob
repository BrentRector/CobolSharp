*> user-defined words or system-names." external-locale-name-1 (the LOCALE
*> clause, 12.3.7.2) and entry-convention-name-1 (the ENTRY-CONVENTION
*> clause, 11.9.7) are SYSTEM-NAMES (8.3.2.3.1); NESTED and USER-DEFAULT are 8.9-reserved
*> from 2002 - so both slots below are refused with COBOLNET0901. The 8.9
*> funnel's retired keyword ladder exempted BOTH slots whole (it could not
*> tell the keyword COBOL from the name beside it), so this compiled clean
*> before PB764 split the keyword off as a `formatWord`.
