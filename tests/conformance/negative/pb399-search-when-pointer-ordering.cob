      *> reaches and not in one caller of it (kb/Work PB399).  ISO §8.8.4.2.2 Format 3
      *> (message-tag-object-or-pointer-reference) prints only `IS [NOT] EQUAL TO` / `=` / `<>`; a SEARCH
      *> WHEN phrase carries an ordinary relation condition (§14.9.37.3), so an ordering operator over a

      *> ⚠ THE TABLE ELEMENT IS NUMERIC, NOT A POINTER, ON PURPOSE.  ISO §13.18.60.3 SR14 admits a USAGE
      *> POINTER item only "for an elementary data item at level 1 or an elementary data item subordinate to
      *> a type declaration that includes the STRONG phrase", so a table OF pointers is illegal source and
      *> this case would then reject for §13.18.60's reason while reading as evidence for §8.8.4.2's.  The
