      *> kb/Work PB409. ISO 14.9.18.3 SR1: "The GOBACK statement shall not be specified in a declarative
      *> procedure for which the GLOBAL phrase is specified in the associated USE statement." Every edition
      *> that has the GOBACK statement at all (a 2002 introduction) states this rule, and 4.2.2 obliges a
      *> conforming implementation to indicate a syntax-rule violation at compile time - a silent accept is
      *> not one. The USE statement here is 1985-legal, so the ONLY rule this program breaks above 85 is SR1.
      *> POSITIVE CONTROL: the same declarative without the GLOBAL phrase is accepted -

      *> NOT THIS RULE: a GOBACK written OUTSIDE the declarative but executed within its RANGE is LEGAL and
