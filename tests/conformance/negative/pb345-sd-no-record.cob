*> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §13.4.6.3 syntax rule 2: "One or more record description entries

*> The sort-merge arm never had §13.4.5.3 SR3's permission -- that is a FORMATS 1 AND 2
*> rule of the FILE description entry -- and §14.9.40.3 SR6 a) says why: "The data items
*> identified by key data-names shall be described in records associated with file-name-1."
*> Until kb/Work PB345 the ONLY diagnostic this program drew was the compiler's own
*> deferral warning, "SORT 'S1' without an SD record - not implemented" (COBOLNET1756),
*> followed by a run-unit abort -- the compiler apologising for the source's error.
