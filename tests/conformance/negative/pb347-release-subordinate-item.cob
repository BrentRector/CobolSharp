*> ISO 1989:2023 §14.9.32.3 syntax rule 1: "Record-name-1 shall be the name of a logical record
*> in a sort-merge file description entry and it may be qualified."
*> A 05 item subordinate to a record is not itself a logical record, so it is not a record-name-1.
*> Accepted, the compiler released SR-DATA's 5-byte image space-extended to the SD's 8 bytes: a record
*> the program never released, injected into the sorted result.
*> §4.2.2 makes the compile-time indication mandatory for "violations of the general formats and the
*> explicit syntax rules of standard COBOL". The rule is written identically in 1985, 2002 and 2014, so
*> there is no edition gate and every edition rejects. COBOLNET1757 (kb/Work PB347).
