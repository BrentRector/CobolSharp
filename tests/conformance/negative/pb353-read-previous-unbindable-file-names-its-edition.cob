      *> reject-at: 85
      *> kb/Work PB353. An edition gate keyed on a BOUND NODE'S SHAPE is silently un-gated on every path
      *> that bails out before the node is built: a written construct's PARSE node is always present, but
      *> the bound node it would have produced is dropped (BoundUnsupported / BoundNop) the moment the
      *> binder refuses the statement, so an introduction gate must fire on RECOGNITION. Each program in
      *> this family violates a SECOND rule as well, so the binder refuses it before the bound node exists;
      *> a per-edition compiler must still name the edition of the post-85 construct that was WRITTEN.
      *> Measured before the fix: each of these reported its other error ALONE at --std 85.
      *> HERE: 14.9.30.2 Format 1 prints PREVIOUS as an alternative of the direction phrase, and
      *> 14.9.30.3 SR8 ("If neither the NEXT phrase nor the PREVIOUS phrase is specified and ACCESS MODE
      *> SEQUENTIAL is specified ... the NEXT phrase is implied") makes an IMPLIED direction not a
      *> WRITTEN phrase - so only the PREVIOUS alternative gates.
      *> 8.4.2.1: the READ names no declared file, so the ONE file-name resolution step returns before
      *> IBoundRead.Kind exists. READ ... PREVIOUS is still written.
