*> ISO 1989:2023 §14.9.51.3 syntax rule 5: "Record-name-1 is the name of a logical record in the
*> file section of the data division and may be qualified."
*> WS-REC is a WORKING-STORAGE 01. It is a record description entry but not a logical record OF A FILE,
*> so §14.9.51.3 SR1 - "The write file is the file referenced by file-name-1 or by the file-name
*> associated with record-name-1" - has no file to name. This is the arm that used to draw only the
*> COBOLNET1756 DEFERRAL WARNING: the compiler announced ITS OWN gap for what is the source's error, and
*> the program compiled.
*> §4.2.2 makes the compile-time indication mandatory for "violations of the general formats and the
*> explicit syntax rules of standard COBOL". The rule is written identically in 1985, 2002 and 2014, so
*> there is no edition gate and every edition rejects. COBOLNET1757 (kb/Work PB347).
