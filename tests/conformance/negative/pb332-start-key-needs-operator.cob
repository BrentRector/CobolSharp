      *> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
      *> ISO 14.9.41.2 prints the KEY phrase as `KEY relational-operator { data-name-1 |
      *> record-key-name-1 }`. relational-operator carries NO brackets - verified on the 600 dpi render
      *> of printed folio 754 - so writing the KEY phrase without an operator is not a spelling of this
      *> format. 14.9.41.4 GR15 supplies the implied comparison only for the OTHER case: "If the KEY
      *> phrase is not specified, the behavior is the same as if KEY IS EQUAL TO data-name-1 or
      *> record-key-name-1 had been specified" - the whole phrase omitted, never the operator alone.
      *> The spelling below compiled and RAN until kb/Work PB332, positioning as though EQUAL had been
      *> written; an under-rejection is the half of a format defect no golden ever notices, because the
      *> program that provokes it is the one nobody writes on purpose.
