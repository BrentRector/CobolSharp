      *> ⛔ IT LOOKED COVERED AND WAS NOT - twice over, and each neighbouring fixture says so in
      *> its own header. negative/pb1-numeric-arg-trig-family is NAMED for the trig family but its
      *> program calls only the three INVERSE functions ACOS, ASIN and ATAN. And
      *> negative/pb52-intrinsic-argument-stage's header records that COS, SIN, TAN and SIGN
      *> joined IntrinsicArgumentRules.Verified in the same change as SQRT - while its PROGRAM
      *> calls SQRT alone. COS's rule therefore had a table row and no witness: the exact shape

      *> ⚠ EDITION 85 IS IN THE REJECT SET, DELIBERATELY. COS carries IntroducedIn 85 in
      *> IntrinsicCatalog - IntrinsicBinder's D8 comment records that the 42 rows of the 1989
      *> Intrinsic Function Module amendment are part of the 85 dialect here - so at --std 85 the
      *> reference reaches the class screen rather than the COBOLNET1502 edition window, and the
      *> same COBOLNET1627 must fire. (pb1-numeric-arg-trig-family's header asserts the opposite
      *> for ACOS/ASIN/ATAN, "post-85 intrinsics", and omits 85 from its own reject set; that
      *> claim contradicts the catalog and leaves those three unwitnessed at 85.)
