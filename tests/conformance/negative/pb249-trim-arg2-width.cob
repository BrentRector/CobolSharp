      *> kb/Work PB249 - ISO 15.96.3 r2: "argument-2 shall be a SINGLE CHARACTER that is either class alphabetic
      *> or class alphanumeric". 15.96.2 repeats argument-2, and r2 is one sentence about argument-2 - so it
      *> governs the SECOND one exactly as it governs the first. The schema carried the ExactWidth(1) predicate
      *> on the declared position 2 only and had no variadic tail, so FUNCTION TRIM(X3 "A" "BC") bound clean and
      *> the runtime silently kept 'B' and discarded 'C'. The tail predicate rejects it here.
