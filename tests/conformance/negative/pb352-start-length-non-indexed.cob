*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.41.3 SR8 - "If the LENGTH phrase is specified, file-name-1 shall reference a file
*> with indexed organization." Two spellings of the same violation, and until kb/Work PB352 only ONE of
*> them was reachable: the relative arm reported SR8, while on a SEQUENTIAL file the check sat behind an
*> early return, so `START SQF KEY IS = SQ-REC WITH LENGTH 2` violated SR8 AND SR2 and reported NEITHER.
*> The organization-independent syntax rules are now screened before either arm bails, so this program
*> draws SR8 for both files (and SR2 for the sequential one, which is the point: every rule a statement
*> violates gets reported).
