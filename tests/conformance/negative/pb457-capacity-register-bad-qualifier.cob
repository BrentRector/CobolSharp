      *> kb/Work PB457 - ISO 13.18.38.3 SR30 with ISO 8.4.2.2.3 SR4. Qualification of a CAPACITY register is
      *> PERMITTED (8.4.2.2.3 SR2 - "A name may be qualified even though it does not need qualification") and
      *> SR30 says where the register sits, so OTHER-G - which is not in WS-CAP's hierarchy - is not a legal
      *> qualifier: SR4 requires qualifiers "in the order of successively more inclusive levels in the
      *> hierarchy". Contrast tests/conformance/2014/pb457_capacity_register_qualified.cob, the positive half.
