*> reject-at: 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.25.3 SR10 and Table 16, NATIONAL-EDITED row:
*>   | National-edited | | No | No | No | Yes | No | No |
*> The ONLY "Yes" is the "National, National-edited" receiving column - an alphabetic, alphanumeric,
*> alphanumeric-edited, boolean, numeric or numeric-edited receiver is invalid. It is a SEPARATE row
*> from National (which is Yes into boolean and into the numeric column), exactly as
*> Alphanumeric-edited is a separate row from Alphanumeric: an edit mask has no de-editable value and
*> no boolean characters. The receiving COLUMN, by contrast, PAIRS the two, which is why
*> MOVE national -> national-edited is legal and pinned by
*> conformance:{2002,2014,2023}/pb492_national_edited.
*> reject-at omits 85 because the DECLARATION is already a COBOL-2002 introduction there
*> (conformance:negative/pb492-national-edited-at-85, COBOLNET0900) - a different rule and code.
