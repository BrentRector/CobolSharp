      *> times, a table may be referenced by specifying the data-name and any qualifiers that identify the table,
      *> followed immediately by subscripting where one or more of the subscripts is the word ALL." LOG's format (15.55.2) is `( argument-1 )` - exactly one, no repetition.
      *> Before PB62 the ALL was expanded at bind time for EVERY function, so this bound (and evaluated) over a
