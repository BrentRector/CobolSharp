      *> NOT bracketed and carries no ellipsis, so the format states exactly two arguments and neither is
      *> optional — §15.17.3 then gives each its own rule (r1 integer date form, r2 standard numeric time form),
      *> which a one-argument reference leaves with no argument-2 to govern. A reference that supplies one
      *> argument does not match the general format and shall be rejected.
