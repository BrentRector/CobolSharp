*> kb/Work PB445 - SEARCH ALL Format 2 (ISO 1989:2023 14.9.37.2). NOT a syntax rule - the GENERAL FORMAT.
*> Format 2's WHEN operand is a single required brace with TWO alternatives: the
*> `data-name-1 { IS EQUAL TO | IS = } { identifier-3 | literal-1 | arithmetic-expression-1 }` comparison, OR
*> a bare condition-name-1. A condition-name is an ALTERNATIVE TO the whole comparison, never its receiving
*> operand, so `WHEN K-ONE (IX) = 05` is a shape the format does not print.
*>
*> It draws the EXISTING COBOLNET1757 ("an operand a statement's own syntax rules or general format do not
*> admit"), not one of PB445's three syntax-rule codes: the shape question and the syntax rules are different
*> questions and the diagnostic identity follows the mechanism. Without this arm the operand fell through to
*> 14.9.37.3 SR8's "not referenced in the KEY phrase" verdict, which sends a reader looking for a KEY phrase
*> edit that would not help - K-ONE's own data-name K IS the key.
