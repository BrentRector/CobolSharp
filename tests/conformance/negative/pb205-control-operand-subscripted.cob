      *> A SUBSCRIPTED control operand is never legal, and it takes two rules to
      *> say so: ISO 13.18.16.3 SR3 - "Data-name-1 shall not be subject to any
      *> OCCURS clauses" - bars the case where the item HAS an OCCURS, and
      *> 8.4.2.3.3 SR2 - a subscripted reference requires the entry to "contain
      *> an OCCURS clause or [be] subordinate to a data description entry that
      *> contains an OCCURS clause" - bars the case where it has none. Between
      *> them no legal subscripted spelling exists.
      *> MEASURED BEFORE kb/Work PB205: the subscript was DROPPED at capture with
      *> the ref-mod (DataBinder.KeyReference keeps only qualification), so the
      *> clause bound as CONTROL IS CT and only the SR3 shape screen fired - on
      *> the item, never on the written subscript.
