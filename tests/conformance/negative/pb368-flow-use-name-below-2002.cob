      *> This fixture carries NO >>TURN directive on purpose: that would

      *> itself 2002+) and the case would pin the directive's gate
      *> instead of the NAME's, which is the thing kb/Work PB368 made
      *> raisable.  The USE format-3 header takes COBOLNET0877 on the

      *> this case's subject.
