*> ISO §8.4.2.2.3 SR1: "For each non unique user-defined name that is explicitly referenced, uniqueness shall
*> be established through a sequence of qualifiers that precludes any ambiguity of reference."  §8.4.2.2.1
*> states the same rule and lists its six exceptions; none of them covers a report-group name (2 REDEFINES,
*> 3 VARYING, 4 an unreferenced type declaration, 5 a data-name in a clause subordinate to the same group,
*> 6 a paragraph-name in its own section).
*>
*> DET-A is described in BOTH report description entries, and BOTH the USE BEFORE REPORTING declarative and
*> the GENERATE name it WITHOUT the report-name qualifier §8.4.2.2.2 Format 1 provides.  Each is an ambiguous
*> reference and each is COBOLNET1920.  Rejected at EVERY edition: the uniqueness rule has no introduction
*> edition and the Report Writer module carries it in all four.  Before kb/Work PB365 this program compiled
*> with ZERO diagnostics and bound both references to R-A's group, purely because R-A is written first.
