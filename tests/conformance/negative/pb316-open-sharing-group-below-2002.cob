      *> reject-at: 85
      *> kb/Work PB316 - the edition gate on the OPEN SHARING phrase, in
      *> the MULTI-GROUP form. The phrase is a COBOL-2002 introduction
      *> (ISO 14.9.27); it is superset-parsed at every edition and gated
      *> after binding, and since PB316 each repeated group carries its
      *> own phrase - so the gate has to see a phrase that is NOT on the
      *> statement's first group. negative/sharing_below_2002 covers the
      *> file control SHARING clause; this covers the OPEN phrase.
