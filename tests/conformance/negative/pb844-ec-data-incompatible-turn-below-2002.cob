      *> THIS IS THE EDITION FLOOR OF §14.9.25.4 GR6 d) 1, not a bare directive test. The rule —

      *> — is stated at every edition, but its only OBSERVABLE consequence is the exception condition, and
      *> a program can request that the condition be checked only from COBOL-2002 onward. So the MOVE below

      *> COBOL-85 refuses is the REQUEST TO CHECK it. The positive halves are
      *> 2002/pb426_alnum_sender_data_incompatible (checking on, no false raise) and
      *> MoveAlphanumericSenderTests (checking on, the raise).

      *> The fixture's only 2002+ construct is the directive: delete the first line and it compiles at 85,
      *> which is what makes COBOLNET0900 here attributable to the directive and to nothing else.
