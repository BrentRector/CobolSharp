*> THE SECOND ARM of the introduction gate: §5.2.6.4 says the alternatives inside choice indicators "may be
*> specified in any order", so AFTER BEFORE ADVANCING n is the same COBOL-2023 combination as
*> BEFORE AFTER ADVANCING n and must be refused by the same edition gate, with the same COBOLNET0900 naming
*> write-before-and-after-advancing-2023. A gate that keyed on the first word, or on a phrase count, would
*> pass one order and not the other — which is the defect shape kb/Work PB712 was: the gate counted PHRASES.
