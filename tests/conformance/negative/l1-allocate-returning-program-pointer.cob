*> SR1 (it is described with the BASED clause), so the only defect is the RETURNING receiver.  L1PP is
*> category PROGRAM-POINTER - 13.18.60.4 GR24, "A data description entry that specifies the USAGE

*> data-pointer GR23 defines, even though both are class pointer (8.5.2).  SR3 names data-pointer exactly,
*> so a program-pointer (and, by the same reasoning, an object reference) is not admissible here.
