      *> ISO §12.4.5.7.3 SR8 - "Neither data-name-1 nor record-key-name-1 shall be
      *> specified in more than one COLLATING SEQUENCE clause." IX-KEY is named by TWO
      *> key-level (Format-2) COLLATING SEQUENCE clauses of ONE file control entry, which

      *> the ellipsis immediately right of the closing brace of

      *> and this program compiles. Both directions are pinned.
