*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> kb/Work PB236 - ISO 14.9.2.3 SR6's SECOND clause: the operands "shall not be described with
*> level-number 66". RN is a RENAMES entry. It was rejected before PB236 too, but INCIDENTALLY and for the
*> WRONG REASON: DataBinder.BindRenames builds a 66 entry with no PICTURE and no children, so DataItem.IsGroup
*> is false for it and it fell into the "elementary operand" arm. SR6 excludes it BY NAME, and the diagnostic
*> now says so - a rejection for the rule the standard actually gives.
