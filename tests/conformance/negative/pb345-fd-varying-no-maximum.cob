*> The SECOND arm of COBOLNET1836, and the one a RECORD-clause-presence test alone would
*> miss: the clause is written, and still establishes no maximum. ISO/IEC 1989:2023
*> §14.9.30.4 GR6 sizes the implied record description by "the maximum size established
*> by the RECORD clause"; a format-2 RECORD IS VARYING with no TO phrase leaves that to
*> §13.18.43.4 GR10 -- "If integer-3 is not specified, the maximum number of bytes to be
*> contained in any record of the file is equal to the greatest number of bytes described
*> for a record in that file." -- and this file describes no record at all.
