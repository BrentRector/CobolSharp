*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 13.18.63.3 SR30 - "Condition-name and content-validation formats shall not be specified in
*> the report section." This is the WITNESS for that rule, and the rule is enforced as a CONSEQUENCE of two
*> others rather than by a screen of its own: SR33 confines formats 3 and 5 to a level-number of 88, and
*> 13.18.33.3 SR4 - "Report group description entries that are subordinate to an RD entry shall have
*> level-numbers with the values 1 through 49" - refuses 88 in this section (COBOLNET1746, LevelNumberPass).
*> The conjunction is exact, so writing a third screen would report the same line twice.
*> kb/Work PB558 measured the hole this closes: the report-entry walk had no level-88 arm, so the entry was
*> neither rejected nor registered but DROPPED, and a program that went on to reference the condition-name
*> compiled and then aborted at RUN time with a not-implemented exception. PB485 (f37da577b, 2026-09-05) gave
*> the level-number a domain and closed it; this test is what keeps it closed.
*> No edition changes the rule - Annex E carries no 2023 change to SR30 or to SR4, and neither screen has a
*> version predicate - so all four editions reject.
