*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.2 SR8 sentence 2 - "The associated file description entry shall not be a
*> sort-merge file description entry." The SECOND obligation of SR8, and the reason the rule is two
*> rows rather than one: sentence 1 speaks about the file's ORGANIZATION, and a sort-merge file has
*> none to speak of (12.4.5.1 Format 4 admits only the SEQUENTIAL phrase and no key clause at all).
*> Here the entry specifies Format 1 by writing a RECORD KEY clause while an SD describes the file.
*> COBOLNET1900, not COBOLNET0863: the subject is the file DESCRIPTION entry, not a key clause's own
*> rule, and the remedy is a different edit (describe the file with an FD, or drop the clause).
