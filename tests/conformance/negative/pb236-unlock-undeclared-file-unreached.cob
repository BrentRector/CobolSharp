*> reject-at: 2002 2014 2023
*> kb/Work PB236 - the same 8.4.2.1 verdict as the OPEN case, on an UNREACHED path and through a DIFFERENT
*> one of the seven sites, so the fixture proves the resolution step is SHARED and not per-verb. Before the
*> fix this program compiled AND ran to normal completion printing nothing about NOSUCH at all.
*> UNLOCK is a COBOL-2002 introduction (14.9.47), so the *reject-at* list starts at 2002: at --std 85 the
*> statement draws the introduction gate instead, which is a different rule and a different fixture's job.
