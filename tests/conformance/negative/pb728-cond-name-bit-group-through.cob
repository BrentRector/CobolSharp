*> ISO 13.18.63.3 SR29: "If the category of the subject of the entry is boolean, the THROUGH phrase shall not
*> be specified." 13.18.29.4 GR1 b) makes the antecedent real for a GROUP: "a bit group is treated as though it
*> were an elementary data item of usage bit and class and category boolean described with PICTURE 1(m)". So a
*> GROUP-USAGE BIT conditional variable is category boolean and SR29 bars THROUGH on it, exactly as it does on
*> the elementary twin. The screen used to read the raw PICTURE, which a group does not have, so only the
*> elementary arm was enforced (kb/Work PB575 + PB728).
