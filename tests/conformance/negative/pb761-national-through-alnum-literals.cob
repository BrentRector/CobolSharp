*> kb/Work PB761 - the UNDER-REJECTION that discharging the COBOLNET0899
*> national-THROUGH stage would otherwise have opened. While that stage refused
*> EVERY national THROUGH range, no such range ever reached the VALUE category
*> funnel, so removing the stage alone would have let alphanumeric literals seed
*> a national conditional variable in silence.
*> ISO 13.18.63.3 SR5: the VALUE of a category-national subject shall be a
*> national literal or a figurative constant, and SR24 routes a Format-3
*> (condition-name) entry to it. A THROUGH range bound is a VALUE operand like
*> any other, so both bounds are screened.
