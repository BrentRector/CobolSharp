      *> The SIZE-OF-absent arm of the SAME rule as pb458-set-size-literal-over-limit. ISO 14.9.39.2 Format 16 is
      *> SET [ SIZE OF ] data-name-3 TO { integer-2 | arithmetic-expression-5 }: SIZE OF is a BRACKET, so both
      *> spellings are the same format and 14.9.39.3 SR34 governs both - "Integer-2 shall be non-negative, and
      *> shall be equal to or less than the maximum size of data-name-3, as specified in 8.5.1.10."
      *> ⛔ ONE RULE, TWO ARMS, AND THE SECOND ARM IS THE ONE THAT GOES MISSING (feedback_two_arm_dispatch). The
