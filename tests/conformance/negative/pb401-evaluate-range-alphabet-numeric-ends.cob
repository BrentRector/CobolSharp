      *> specified in the THROUGH phrase are of class alphabetic, alphanumeric, or national." A range whose ends
      *> are ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS is of class numeric (14.9.13.2 prints arithmetic-expression-3/-4 among the
      *> range-expression's operands, and 8.8.1.1 makes every constituent of an arithmetic expression numeric), so
