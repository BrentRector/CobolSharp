*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ⛔ THE REPORT-SECTION HALF OF §8.4.3.15.3 SR1 (kb/Work PB429). The rule has two halves and this golden is
*> the second one: "In the report section, PAGE-COUNTER and LINE-COUNTER may be referenced only in a SOURCE
*> clause. In the procedure division, PAGE-COUNTER and LINE-COUNTER may be referenced in any context where an
*> integer data item may appear." conformance:85/pb429_page_counter_receiving is the procedure-division half —
*> ten contexts that admit an integer data item, all accepted; this one is the report section, where the
*> permission is narrow and a counter outside a SOURCE clause is not source at all.
*>
*> The clause that refuses it says the same thing from its own side — §13.18.54.3 SR6: "If the addend is
*> arithmetic-expression-1, any identifiers it contains may reference entries in any section of the data
*> division other than the report section." A report counter IS a report-section reference (§8.4.3.15.1 —
*> "generated automatically and exist independently for each report"), so the two rules agree that a SUM
*> addend may not name one; the compiler answers with SR6's code because SR6 is the rule the written
*> construct breaks. The DETAIL line above the control footing keeps the positive direction visible in the
*> same program: `SOURCE IS PAGE-COUNTER` is the one report-section context SR1 admits, and it is legal here.
