      *> integer operand is required, EVEN THOUGH A PARTICULAR REFERENCE OF THE
      *> NUMERIC FUNCTION MIGHT YIELD AN INTEGER VALUE." 15.15.3 r1 makes CHAR's
      *> argument an integer, and 15.7.1's table makes FUNCTION ABS over a SCALED

      *> IT COMPILED CLEAN (fix-queue PB40). The 15.3 screen resolves through
      *> 8.5.2.1 Table 2's CLASS column, and 15.2 items 5 and 6 put BOTH integer
      *> and numeric functions in class numeric — so the 'i' code could not tell
      *> them apart and admitted both. 15.3 type 6 is INTEGER, and integer is not
      *> a class; that is why a class screen was structurally unable to enforce it.

      *> always-integral arithmetic expression, an INTEGER function) are asserted
      *> by pb40_integer_argument_positions.
