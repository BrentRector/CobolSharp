*> reject-at: 2023
*> kb/Work PB165 - ISO 14.8.2.3.3 rule 2a, the BY CONTENT arm of the Format-2 CALL conformance dispatch,
*> which had no arm at all. 14.9.4.3 SR25 imports "the rules for conformance specified in 14.8.2,
*> Parameters"; 14.8.2.3.3 rule 2a says that for a NUMERIC formal "the conformance rules are the same as
*> for a COMPUTE statement with the argument as the sending operand and the corresponding formal parameter
*> as the receiving operand", and a COMPUTE's sending operand is an arithmetic expression - a category
*> ALPHANUMERIC argument satisfies no such rule. Measured on the pre-fix tree: this program compiled clean
*> and printed LA=0000, a wrong answer with no diagnostic, because CobolArgAdapt's converting view read
*> "ABCD" through the formal's zoned numeric profile. The BY REFERENCE sibling of this dispatch had been
*> checked since PB133; this is the other arm.
