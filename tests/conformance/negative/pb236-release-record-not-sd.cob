*> kb/Work PB236 - ISO 14.9.32.3 SR1: "Record-name-1 shall be the name of a logical record in a sort-merge
*> file description entry and it may be qualified." F-REC is a record of an FD.
*> THE RELEASE IS BEHIND A GO TO ON PURPOSE. That is the shape the defect was measured on: with the statement
*> on a path the flow skips, the run-time loud never fired either, so this program COMPILED AND RAN TO NORMAL
*> COMPLETION with no message at any stage - illegal source shipped in silence. ISO 4.2.2 paragraph 2 makes
*> the compile-time mechanism mandatory for "the general formats and the explicit syntax rules", and a
*> compile-time verdict does not care whether the statement is reached.
