*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> kb/Work PB390 - ISO 14.9.25.3 SR12's SECOND half: "Identifier-3 and identifier-4 shall specify group
*> data items AND SHALL NOT BE REFERENCE-MODIFIED." Only the first half was ever checked. The second was
*> assumed away by a code comment claiming a group "cannot" be reference-modified - false: a group item is
*> reference-modifiable and has its own golden (tests/conformance/2023/pb70_group_reference_modification).
*> 8.4.3.3.4 GR6 makes the result "an elementary data item", which is why the arithmetic spellings
*> (14.9.2.3 SR6 / 14.9.44.3 SR6, whose operands shall be group items) refuse it too.
*> Measured before the fix: this program COMPILED and RAN, moving the WHOLE group with the reference
*> modifier silently discarded - a wrong answer, not a loud one.
