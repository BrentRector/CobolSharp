*> kb/Work PB445 - SEARCH ALL Format 2 (ISO 1989:2023 14.9.37.3 SR7-SR13). Before this item all seven of
*> those syntax rules were unenforced: the binder read the table's index names and occurrence count and
*> nothing key-related, and bound each WHEN through the general condition binder as one opaque expression,
*> so neither the ordered key list nor the WHEN's decomposed operands existed for a rule to be written
*> against. Each of these programs compiled clean and RAN, at every --std.
*>
*> SR9: "All referenced condition-names shall be defined as having only a single value." K-RANGE is a THRU
*> range, so the WHEN is an interval test rather than the key equality the ordered search is defined over.
