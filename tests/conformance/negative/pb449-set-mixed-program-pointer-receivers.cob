      *> ISO 14.9.39.3 SR21 - "Identifier-7 shall reference a data item of category program-pointer.
      *> Identifier-8 shall be of category program-pointer." Format 9's receiving brace is { identifier-7 } ...,
      *> so a program-pointer written among the receivers puts the statement under Format 9 and every OTHER
      *> receiver is in violation of the first sentence.
      *> ⛔ Both operands here are identifiers and both are numeric except PP1, so Format 9 matched syntactically
      *> and was the ONLY format whose receiving operand may be a program-pointer - yet SR21 was violated twice
      *> over and never asked, because the re-route sniffed only receivers[0] and the sender. The program
