*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.41.3 SR6 b) 2. - "It has the same class, category, and usage as that record
*> key." IX-NUM is class numeric, category numeric, usage packed-decimal; IX-KEY is class
*> alphanumeric, category alphanumeric, usage display. The condition was omitted by an explicit
*> design note ("a pre-existing looseness kept as-is"), and its absence also made SR6 b) 3.'s length
*> test unsound: it compared a packed item's 4 character positions against an alphanumeric key's
*> byte width, two incommensurable bases. Both halves of the rule land together.
