*> reject-at: 2023
*> ISO 14.8.4.2 conjunct 1 (Annex E.2 item 9): at >=2023 the FILE STATUS data item of an
*> external file connector shall ITSELF be an external data item. Here a SINGLE program
*> declares FD F IS EXTERNAL with FILE STATUS IS WS-ST, where WS-ST is a plain (non-external)
*> WORKING-STORAGE item. This exercises the lone-describer externality face (there is no
*> second corresponding SELECT to reconcile). Below 2023 the requirement did not exist.
