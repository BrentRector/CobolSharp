*> kb/Work PB977 - ISO 12.3.7.2 prints the FOR phrase in ONE position: "ALPHABET alphabet-name-2 FOR
*> NATIONAL IS ..." - after the name, before IS.  Written AFTER the definition it is a spelling no
*> edition prints and no dialect owns; it used to compile clean as a "historical superset" while the
*> same postfix on the CLASS clause drew a bare parse error.  Expected: COBOLNET2315 at every edition.
