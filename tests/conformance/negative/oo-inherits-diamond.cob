*> ISO 11.3.4 GR4's OWN subject - the DIAMOND: "If the same class is inherited more than once, then only
*> one copy of the data for that class is added to object-class-name-1." The rule's own NOTE says the
*> repeat can only be INDIRECT ("While the same class cannot be directly inherited more than once, a class
*> can be indirectly inherited multiple times"), which needs some class to carry two DIRECT bases - and
*> that is exactly what Annex A.4.10 item 1 declines, so the single-copy question never arises.
