*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.2 SR8 sentence 1 over its THIRD operand - the collating-sequence-clause,
*> which 12.4.5.1 prints in Format 1 and in no other format. The rejection itself is not new
*> (COBOLNET1582 has always refused it); its CITATION was 12.4.5.7.1, the clause's descriptive
*> General paragraph, which states no obligation. SR8 is the sentence that does, and the message now
*> says so (kb/Work PB742, CLAUDE.md rule 1: a citation is validated, never inherited).
*> The traceability row SR-12.4.5.2-8 therefore names TWO code locations: the key-clause rows in
*> FileControlKeyRules, and this site - which reports where it does because the same test is also the
*> guard that stops the rest of the collating resolution.
