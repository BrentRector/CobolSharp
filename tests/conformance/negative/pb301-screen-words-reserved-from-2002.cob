      *> kb/Work PB301 - the REJECTING arm of the screen-word rule, and the reason the fix is a nameSlot row and
      *> not an unconditional admission. ISO 8.9 reserves COL, COLS, COLUMNS, CRT, CURSOR and SCREEN from
      *> COBOL-2002, and 8.3.2.1 rule 1 - "Reserved words shall not be used as user-defined words or
      *> system-names" - therefore bars every one of them from the slot below at 2002/2014/2023. The SAME six
      *> declarations are CONFORMING at COBOL-85, where 8.9 does not reserve them; that acceptance lane is
      *> tests/conformance/85/pb301_screen_words_as_user_words.
      *> WHAT THIS PINS THAT "is rejected" DOES NOT: the DIAGNOSTIC. The generated reservation gate withdraws
      *> each word from `cobolWord` at the editions 8.9 reserves it and `reservedGatedWord` re-admits it in the
      *> DEFINITION slot alone, so the entry still PARSES and the 8.9 funnel answers with COBOLNET0901 naming
      *> the rule. Without that second half the user gets COBOL0001 "no viable alternative", which names
      *> nothing and sends them looking for a syntax error that is not there.

      *> without STATUS is not the declined CRT STATUS clause (12.3.7 spells that CRT STATUS IS), so this
