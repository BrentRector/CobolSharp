      *> ISO 13.18.63.3 SR13, SENTENCE 2: "The VALUE clause shall not be specified at subordinate levels within
      *> this group."  13.18.63.4 GR5 initializes the group AREA "without consideration for the individual
      *> elementary or group items contained within this group", so a subordinate VALUE has no defined effect;
      *> the rule forbids writing one rather than leaving the two initializations to race.
      *> MEASURED BEFORE THIS SCREEN: this compiled clean, and B's own VALUE "ZZ" was silently discarded (GV
      *> displayed "ABCD") - the right ANSWER by GR5, from source the standard does not permit, with nothing
      *> said about it.  Landed with SR14's two conjuncts because all three restrict the same subject's
      *> subtree; one screen, so a fourth case is automatic rather than a fourth unscreened arm.
