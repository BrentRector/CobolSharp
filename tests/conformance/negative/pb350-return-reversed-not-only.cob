      *> ISO §14.9.34.2 with §14.9.34.3 SR4 — the REVERSED-ORDER arm, written with only its NOT AT END half.
      *> SR4 says "The AT END phrase and the NOT AT END phrase, when specified, may be written in reversed
      *> order": it permits REVERSING the two phrases, and "when specified" is a condition on the reversal,
      *> not a licence to omit either one. The AT END line of the general format is still unbracketed, so it
      *> is still mandatory (§5.2.6.2), and this program is rejected at every edition.
      *> ⛔ THIS IS THE SECOND GRAMMAR ARM, and the reason the screen lives in the binder rather than in
      *> returnAtEndPhrase: `NOT AT? END statementBlock (AT? END statementBlock)?` made the AT END HALF of the
      *> reversed pair optional too, so a screen that only asked whether the PHRASE NODE was present would
      *> have left this arm compiling (CLAUDE.md rule 4 — the two-arm dispatch with one arm fixed). The bind
      *> screen asks instead whether the AT END BLOCK is null after PhraseBlocks.Split has normalized position
      *> away, which is one test covering both arms.
      *> The legal complement — the SAME reversal with BOTH halves — is exercised by DRAIN-2 of
      *> tests/conformance/2023/pb350_return_at_end_required.cob and must keep compiling.
