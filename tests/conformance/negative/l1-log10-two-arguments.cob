      *> ISO 15.56.2 general format, the COMPLEMENT of the shape:
      *> "<u>FUNCTION</u> <u>LOG10</u> ( argument-1 )" shows exactly
      *> ONE argument and no repetition ellipsis, and ISO 15.3 says
      *> "The definition of a function specifies the number of

      *> the function ignores, it is source the format does not admit.

      *> The positive half of this format is l1_log10_format, which
      *> writes the shape over every argument-1 shape 15.3 type 10

      *> cannot distinguish "the format is enforced" from "anything
      *> inside the parentheses is accepted", which is why this file
