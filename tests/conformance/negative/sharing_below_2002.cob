      *> The SHARING clause (ISO §12.4.5.15 / §14.9.27) is a COBOL-2002 introduction. Residue migration #3
      *> (DESIGN-version-conformance-pipeline.md): the parse-time {is2002()}? predicates (SELECT + OPEN) AND the
      *> reverse-signature ReservedWordEditionHints arm are GONE — SHARING parses at all editions (superset) and the
      *> introduction gate is enforced at BIND (DataBinder SELECT + BindOpen phrase -> Check(FileSharingClause2002)),
      *> so below 2002 it is an exact COBOLNET0900. (A file NAMED SHARING stays a legal user word at 85 — verified:
      *> the OPEN name-list disambiguation is byte-safe; only the SHARING WITH <mode> phrase is gated.)
