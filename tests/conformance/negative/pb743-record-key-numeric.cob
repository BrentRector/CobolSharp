*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.12.3 SR2, the CATEGORY arm - "Data-name-1 and data-name-2 shall reference a
*> data item of category alphanumeric or category national within a record description entry
*> associated with the file-name specified in this file control entry."
*> The sentence joins TWO obligations with the word "within": a CATEGORY and a LOCATION. Only the
*> location half was screened, so a PIC 9(5) prime key compiled clean, ran, and built an index on an
*> operand the standard forbids as a key (kb/Work PB743, measured: OPEN=00 / WRITE=00, zero
*> diagnostics). IX-KEY here satisfies the LOCATION half exactly - it is inside this file's record
*> description - which is what makes the case a discriminator for the category arm alone.
