*> ISO 15.94.2 + 5.2.6.2 (kb/Work PB250 - the stack-exclusion negative FMT-15.94.2 owed under its OWN name;
*> only the NUMVAL-C twin existed, at negative/pb60-numvalc-anycase-position.cob). The general format puts
*> `LOCALE [ locale-name-1 ]` and `argument-2` in one bracketed STACK, and 5.2.6.2 says brackets enclosing
*> alternatives mean "the syntax element contained within the brackets or one of the alternatives contained
*> within the brackets may be explicitly specified" - ONE of them, never both. Writing an explicit currency
*> string AND the LOCALE keyword is therefore not a legal shape of this format.
