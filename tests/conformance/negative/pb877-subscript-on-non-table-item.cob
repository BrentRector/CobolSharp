*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> kb/Work PB877 - ISO 8.4.2.3.3 SR2, the NEGATIVE half of the rule whose POSITIVE half
*> tests/conformance/85/pb877_subscripted_subscript.cob witnesses.
*>
*> SR2: "If a subscript is specified, the data description entry describing qualified-data-name-1 or the
*> conditional variable associated with qualified-condition-name-1 shall contain an OCCURS clause or shall
*> be subordinate to a data description entry that contains an OCCURS clause." PLAIN below satisfies
*> NEITHER half - it carries no OCCURS clause and no ancestor of it does - so no subscript may be written
*> on it, at any edition. Nothing in 8.4.2.3.3 SR5's seven exceptions is about writing a subscript; SR5 is
*> about OMITTING one.
*>
*> WHY THE CODE MATTERS AND NOT MERELY THE REJECTION. Before PB877 this drew COBOLNET0899, "a reference
*> shape COBOL.NET does not yet implement as a receiver" - a PROMISE, about source no edition of the
*> standard will ever admit - and the identical reference on the SENDING side compiled clean and aborted at
*> run time, where 4.2.2 requires a compile-time mechanism. COBOLNET2096 names the rule on both sides.
