      *> ISO 15.28.3 rule 1: "Argument-1 is optional and when specified shall be the name of a file connector
      *> that is specified in an FD statement." An SD is a sort-merge file DESCRIPTION, not an FD (13.5): the sort file is not a file connector in the 15.28 sense. Before PB63 the resolver matched the bare name only, so
      *> this compiled clean and answered rule 2a's two spaces. The file-connector-name argument form is 2023.
