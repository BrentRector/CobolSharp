      *> ISO 7.3.24.2 general format (verified against the PRINTED page, folio 84):

      *> SOURCE, FIXED and FREE are UNDERLINED (required words); FORMAT and IS are not, so
      *> per 5.2.3 they are optional words. The braces are a plain required choice, so
      *> exactly one of FIXED or FREE shall be written - UNKNOWN is a user-defined word the
      *> directive's syntax does not specify, which 7.3.3 SR6 forbids ("compiler-instruction
      *> is composed of compiler-directive words, system-names, and user-defined words AS
      *> SPECIFIED IN THE SYNTAX OF EACH DIRECTIVE"), and it selects no reference format, so
      *> 7.3.24.3 GR1 has no answer for the text that follows.
