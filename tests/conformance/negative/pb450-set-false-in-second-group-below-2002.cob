*> reject-at: 85
*> kb/Work PB450 - the COBOL-2002 introduction gate on SET condition-name TO FALSE, asked at the position a
*> STATEMENT-level gate cannot see. ISO 14.9.39.2 Format 4 repeats the whole
*> `{ condition-name-1 } ... TO { TRUE | FALSE }` unit, so the FALSE arm here is written in the SECOND group
*> and the first group is a plain COBOL-85 TRUE. The gate reads every group's own keyword
*> (VersionConformancePass.ParseArm.VisitSetBooleanStatement over setConditionPhrase), so it fires; a gate
*> that asked the statement node for its FALSE token after the phrase rule landed would find none and let a
*> COBOL-2002 construct through unmeasured at --std 85.
*> The FALSE arm's COBOL-2002 date is constructs.json set-condition-false-2002 - "COBOL-85's Format 4 has the
*> TRUE arm only" - on the same derived authority as its VALUE-clause half (value-false-phrase-2002); the
*> 2023 Annex E carries no 85->2002 SET row (the A1 authority-sufficiency gap D18).
*> 85 ONLY: at 2002 and above this is conforming source and is the positive
*> tests/conformance/2002/pb450_set_condition_mixed_groups.
