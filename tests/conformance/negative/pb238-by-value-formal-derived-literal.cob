*> ISO 14.9.4.3 SR23's SECOND subject (kb/Work PB238): "...or its corresponding formal parameter is
*> specified with the BY VALUE phrase". Here the argument carries NO phrase at all - 14.9.4.4 GR9 b)
*> derives BY VALUE from the corresponding formal - so SR23 governs a literal-2 the source never marked.
*> This leg was doubly unreachable before PB238: the bare literal arm hard-coded BY CONTENT (the VALUE
*> outcome happened by the copy-out skip, not by GR9 b)'s mechanism), and nothing consulted the formal's
*> declared mode. The constant-name spelling is the same rule: 13.10.4 GR1 makes K substitute the
*> alphanumeric literal "XY" and GR2 gives it that literal's class, so SR23 screens the SUBSTITUTED
*> literal, never the name.
