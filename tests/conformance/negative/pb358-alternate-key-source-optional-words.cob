*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.6.2, THE CONFORMING MINIMUM SPELLING of the alternate clause's declined key form -
*> the ALTERNATE twin of pb358-record-key-source-optional-words, and here for the same reason: on printed
*> page 350 (folio 320, RENDERED) ALTERNATE, RECORD and SOURCE carry underline rules while KEY and BOTH
*> occurrences of IS do not, and 8.3.2.4.3 makes an un-underlined uppercase word one that "may be specified
*> at the user's option with no effect on the semantics of the format".
*> So "ALTERNATE RECORD F-ALT SOURCE F-K2" is the same clause as the fully-spelled twin and draws the same
*> named decline. RECORD is written because it IS underlined - the grammar's ALTERNATE RECORD? is a
*> documented superset leniency, and a spec-derived fixture pins the standard's spelling, never a leniency.
