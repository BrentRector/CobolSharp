      *> 14.9.2.3 SR6: "Identifier-4 and identifier-5 shall be alphanumeric group items, national group
      *> items, variable-length groups, or strongly-typed group items and shall not be described with
      *> level-number 66." GALIAS renames the group SG WITHOUT the THROUGH phrase, so by 13.18.45.4 GR1
      *> it takes SG's attributes and storage - but it is still an entry described with level-number 66.
      *> The screen asked the item whose STORAGE the reference uses (SG) instead of the entry the NAME
      *> denotes (GALIAS), and this program compiled; the THROUGH form was already refused.
