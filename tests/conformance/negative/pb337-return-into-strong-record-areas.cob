*> be a strongly-typed group item of the same type as identifier-1."
*> The RETURN twin of pb337-read-into-strong-record-areas, and the wording differs: READ's rule 2
*> says "at most one ... if specified" because 13.4.5.3 SR3 permits an FD with no record
*> description entry, while this one says "exactly one" -- 13.4.6.3 SR2 requires a record
*> description under an SD.  The SD here has TWO record areas.  COBOLNET1995.
