      *> kb/Work PB549 — §8.4.3.13.3 syntax rule 1: "Identifier-1 shall be of category alphanumeric or
      *> national." The braced operand list of a program-address-identifier is three alternatives with three
      *> rules over them (SR1 identifier-1, SR2 "Literal-1 shall be an alphanumeric or national literal whose
      *> length is not zero", SR3 "Program-prototype-name-1 shall be a program prototype specified in the
      *> REPOSITORY paragraph"), and the grammar cannot tell identifier-1 from program-prototype-name-1 — both
      *> are a bare word — so all three are screened at BIND, by name, on COBOLNET2157. NN is a PIC 9 item:
      *> it is neither a prototype declared in the REPOSITORY paragraph nor an alphanumeric or national
      *> identifier, and §8.4.3.13.4 GR1 a) routes its CONTENT through §8.3.2.2 as a program-name, which a
      *> numeric item cannot supply.
