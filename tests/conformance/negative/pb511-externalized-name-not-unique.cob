      *> kb/Work PB511 — §13.18.22.3 syntax rule 2: "In the same source element, the externalized name of the
      *> subject of the entry that includes the EXTERNAL clause shall not be the same as the externalized name
      *> of any other entry that includes the EXTERNAL clause."
      *> ⛔ THE RULE ONLY BECAME VIOLABLE WHEN THE AS PHRASE GAINED A GRAMMAR. Before it, every externalized
      *> name was §13.18.22.4 GR5's default — the subject's own data-name or file-name — and §8.4.2.2 already
      *> keeps those unique inside one source element. With literal-1 writable, two subjects can claim ONE
      *> run-unit cell, and the consequence is not a diagnostic-quality one: the cell is keyed by exactly this
      *> name, so a PIC X(3) record and a PIC X(9) record would silently alias one another's storage.
