*> ISO 1989:2023 Annex A.4.13 item 1) "REWRITE FILE file-name-1 (14.9.35)" - the REWRITE twin, refused by
*> name with COBOLNET1706 from the SAME binder site as its WRITE sibling. Before 2026-09-02 the two arms
*> diverged: WRITE FILE compiled and ran, REWRITE FILE compiled clean and deferred to a RUN-TIME
*> NotImplemented throw whose interpolated record name was EMPTY. One construct, two arms, two postures,
*> neither of them the documented one - which is why these two fixtures land as a PAIR.
*> The spelling also carries `RECORD`, which 14.9.35.2's printed general format (RENDERED, PDF p710) shows
*> as an OPTIONAL WORD (not underlined) and which this grammar did not accept at all until the same change:
*> `REWRITE record-name-1 RECORD FROM ...` on the MANDATORY arm was being rejected as legal source, an
*> under-accept independent of A.4.13 that the positive control now pins.
