      *> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
      *> kb/Work PB528 - the COMPOSITION syntax rules of ISO 1989:2023 13.18.40.3. PictureAnalyzer's symbol
      *> loop tested MEMBERSHIP only, so every one of these compiled clean at all four editions and several
      *> RAN, producing an image no rule defines (PIC 99.99.99 turned 123456 into 56.00.00; PIC ZZ**9 rendered
      *> 7 as "  **7", two replacement characters in one item). Each entry below is COBOLNET1934, and each
      *> rule is a syntax rule of every edition from 1985 on, so all four reject.
      *>
      *> PB01  SR16 - "The symbol 'P' may appear only as a continuous string of 'P's in the leftmost or
      *>            rightmost digit positions in character-string-1": 9P9's P is at neither end.
      *> PB02  SR16 - two separate strings of 'P's are not "a continuous string".
      *> PB03  SR17 - "The symbol 'P' and the symbol '.' are mutually exclusive in character-string-1."
      *> PB04  SR18 - "The symbol 'S', if present, shall be the first symbol in character-string-1."
      *> PB05  SR18 - the same rule with 'S' last.
      *> PB06  SR19 - "the symbol 'V' shall either immediately precede the first symbol 'P' or immediately
      *>            follow the last symbol 'P'": in 9V9PP a '9' stands between the V and the P string.
      *> PB07  SR20 - "The symbol 'V' and the symbol '.' are mutually exclusive in character-string-1."
      *> PB08  SR21 - "The symbol 'Z' and the symbol '*' are mutually exclusive in character-string-1"; one item
      *>            has ONE replacement character (13.18.40.5 rule 7).
      *> PB09  SR22 - "Neither the symbol 'S' nor the symbol '*' shall be specified in character-string-1 when
      *>            the BLANK WHEN ZERO clause is specified for the subject of the entry" - the '*' leg.
      *> PB10  SR22 - the same rule's 'S' leg. This one was worse than silent: the BLANK WHEN ZERO promotion
      *>            required !signed, so the clause was DISCARDED and the item stayed pure numeric.
      *> PB11  SR24 - "For fixed insertion with editing sign control symbols, only one currency symbol and only
      *>            one editing sign control symbol may be used in character-string-1" - two signs. They are
      *>            not a floating string: 13.18.40.5 rule 6 needs the two occurrences ADJACENT but for the
      *>            simple insertion symbols, and three '9's stand between these.
      *> PB12  SR24 - the same rule's currency leg.
      *> PB13  SR12 b - "Each of the symbols from the set 'CR', 'DB', 'E', 'S', 'V' '.' may appear only once in
      *>            character-string-1" - two 'V'.
      *> PB14  SR12 b - three '.' (MOVE 123456 through this rendered 56.00.00).
      *> PB15  SR12 b - two 'CR' (NOTE 2: 'CR' is ONE symbol though it is two characters).
      *> PB16  SR12 a - "Character-string-1 shall contain: at least on[e] one of the symbols from the set 'A',
      *>            'N', 'X', 'Z', '1', '9', *', or at least two occurrences of one of the symbols from the
      *>            set character-1, 'x', '+', '-', and the currency symbol." BBB has neither, so it
      *>            describes no digit position and no character position at all.
      *> PB17  SR12 a - a single '+' is one occurrence, not two (PIC ++ is legal and is in the positive golden).
      *> PB18  SR23 - "The editing sign control symbols '+', '-', 'CR', and 'DB' are mutually exclusive in
      *>            character-string-1", the floating-point edited exception aside.
