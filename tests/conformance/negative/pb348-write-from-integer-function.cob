*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.51.3 syntax rule 4: "If identifier-1 is a function-identifier, it shall
*> reference an alphanumeric or national function."  WRITE states the rule UNCONDITIONALLY -- it is
*> not the FILE-phrase reading (SR10) nor the no-FILE reading (SR11, which admits a boolean function
*> too), so a conforming WRITE ... FROM function-identifier satisfies SR4 and SR11 only inside SR4's
*> narrower set.  FUNCTION LENGTH is an integer function and is outside it.
*> The SIBLING half of kb/Work PB348: WRITE, REWRITE and RELEASE shared ONE operand binder that
*> applied none of the three rules, so fixing RELEASE alone would have left this arm silent
*> (feedback_two_arm_dispatch).  The paired positive is the alphanumeric-function admission pinned
*> by conformance:2023/pb10_function_identifier_sending.
