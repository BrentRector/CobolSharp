      *> literals in formats 1, 2, and 4 of the VALUE clause may be numeric when they shall be converted to their
      *> numeric-edited forms according to the rules for the MOVE statement" - is the ONLY rule that admits a
      *> numeric literal on a numeric-edited subject, and Annex E.3.3 item 43 DATES it: "VALUE clause,
      *> numeric-edited items and numeric literals. It is now permitted to allow numeric-edited data items to be
      *> assigned values specified as numeric literals." A COBOL-2023 addition, so below 2023 the edited image had
      *> to be written as an alphanumeric or national literal (SR7).
