      *> DERIVED BEFORE MEASURING. §8.4.3.13.4 GR1 makes a program-address-identifier "of class pointer and

      *> excludes USAGE POINTER — this is the category a fix that special-cased "USAGE POINTER" would have

      *> (usage-program-pointer-2002; at 85 the usage gate rejects the data entry under its own rule).
