*> reject-at: 2002 2014 2023
*> kb/Work PB466 - RESUME AT procedure-name, the exception-declarative arm of the same resolution step. The
*> statement is the COBOL-2002 introduction of the exception-handling module, so 85 is not in the reject set:
*> there the source is refused for the construct, not for the reference, and a reject-at that named 85 would
*> be measuring a different rule.
*> ISO 14.9.33.2 prints procedure-name-1 and 8.4.2.2.1 governs the reference like any other: rule 1 is false
*> for DUP-R (S-ONE and S-TWO both declare it) and rule 6 cannot excuse it, because the reference is written
*> in the declarative section H, which declares no DUP-R. 8.4.2.2.3 SR1's "sequence of qualifiers that
*> precludes any ambiguity of reference" is owed and absent.
*> Worth its own witness because the consequence is invisible at the site: RESUME AT names where the run unit
*> CONTINUES after a fatal exception condition, so an arbitrary pick resumes ordinary execution in a paragraph
*> the author never nominated, with the exception already reported as handled.
