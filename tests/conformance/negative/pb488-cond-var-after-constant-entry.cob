*> A CONSTANT entry (13.10) is a compile-time substitution and describes NO data item, so the 88 written
*> after one follows no entry describing an item. kb/Work PB488: the old `stack.Peek()` reader stepped over
*> the constant entry exactly as it stepped over a level-66 alias and silently associated ORPHAN with A.
*> The CONSTANT entry is a COBOL-2002 addition, so 85 rejects it at its own introduction gate instead.
