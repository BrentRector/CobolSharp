*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ⛔ A LINE CLAUSE MAY NOT NEST INSIDE A LINE CLAUSE (kb/Work PB565). ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §13.18.35.3 SR4:
*> "Within a given report group description entry, an entry that contains a LINE clause shall not have a
*> subordinate entry that also contains a LINE clause."
*>
*> The rule is what makes §13.18.38.4 GR10's vertical pair exhaustive rather than overlapping: GR10c is "the
*> entry also contains a relative LINE clause" and GR10d is "the entry is a group entry having subordinate
*> entries with relative LINE clauses", and SR4 guarantees an entry is at most one of the two. Without it a
*> repeating entry could carry a LINE clause AND have subordinate ones, and §13.18.38.4 GR12's "integer-3 lines
*> vertically beneath the preceding occurrence" would have two different lines to measure from.
*>
*> It is a rule of EVERY edition — the single-operand LINE clause is COBOL-85 syntax — so this program is
*> rejected at all four, on COBOLNET2199, the LINE clause syntax-rule family. Deleting the inner LINE clause
*> makes it conforming: one report line at LINE-COUNTER + 1 carrying N.
