      *> ISO §14.9.39.3 syntax rule 13, the LEADING requirement: "If object-class-name-1 is
      *> specified and the data item referenced by identifier-3 is described with an
      *> object-class-name, the data item shall be described with the FACTORY phrase."
      *> §14.9.39.4 GR10 sends the class's FACTORY object, and §13.18.60.4 GR22 d)1.b. makes a
      *> receiver WITHOUT the FACTORY phrase a holder of INSTANCE objects — two different
      *> objects with two different method interfaces (§9.3.6), so the axis is invariant.
      *> Before kb/Work PB389 this program was refused because FACTORY OF could not be
      *> DECLARED at all; the rejection is now the rule's, and the conforming spelling
      *> (`01 F … FACTORY OF …C ONLY.` + `SET F TO …C.`) runs — see
