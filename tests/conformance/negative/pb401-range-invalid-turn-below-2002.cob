      *> and above shall be REJECTED at COBOL-85 for naming a directive that edition has no such thing as.
      *> The EVALUATE range-expression itself is not gated: it is EVALUATE's own since 1985, and at 85 it is
      *> evaluated by 14.7.8 rule 2's empty-range behaviour with no exception condition to set.
