      *> (1) PIC X(3) is class ALPHANUMERIC (ISO 8.5.2.1 Table 2).
      *> (2) PIC ZZ9.99 is category NUMERIC-EDITED, which Table 2 puts
      *> under class ALPHANUMERIC when its usage is display - the
      *> rule says CLASS, so however numeric the item looks it is not

      *> Module member (unlike ACOS/ASIN/ATAN, which are post-85 and
      *> are therefore rejected at 85 for a DIFFERENT reason - which
      *> is why pb1's reject-at header omits 85 and this one does
      *> not), and 15.82.3 r1 has no edition-conditional wording.
