*> ISO 14.9.4.3 SR25 -> 14.8.3.2, THE RETURNING HALF (kb/Work PB204; COBOLNET1736's witness). SR25 makes
*> "the rules for conformance specified in 14.8.2, Parameters and 14.8.3, Returning items" apply to a
*> Format-2 CALL, and 14.8.3.2 says: "If either the sending or the receiving operand is a variable length
*> group, the sending operand and the receiving operand shall be compatible, as described in 8.5.1.12."
*> The callee's returning item puts its dynamic-length member at relative byte position 2 and the CALL's
*> RETURNING identifier puts its own at 3, so 8.5.1.12.2 finds no correspondence. Before PB204 NO 14.8.3
*> conformance check existed for an AS NESTED call at all - the pair simply reached the emitter.
