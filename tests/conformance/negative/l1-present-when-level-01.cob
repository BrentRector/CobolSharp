      *> ⛔ THIS FIXTURE WRITES THE RULE'S OWN FORBIDDEN CONSTRUCT — a
      *> LEVEL 1 entry carrying PRESENT WHEN — and that is the whole
      *> point of it. The pre-existing witness
      *> negative/declined-validate-present-when.cob writes
      *> `05 WS-A PIC X(4) PRESENT WHEN WS-F = 1.`, a level SR20
      *> PERMITS; it pins the Annex A.4.14 decline, never SR20's
      *> prohibition. Its twin for level 77 is

      *> WHY THE ROW IS CONFORMS AND WHY A NEGATIVE IS ITS WITNESS.
      *> §13.16.2 Format 1's `[ validation-clauses ]` group is the only
      *> place a data description entry can carry PRESENT WHEN, and
      *> that clause (§13.18.41 format 2) is item 5 of Annex A.4.14
      *> (VALIDATE), an optional element whose support this
      *> implementation does not claim (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §5). Annex
      *> A.4.1 admits the syntax of an optional element only when
      *> support is claimed, so the clause is refused BY NAME with
      *> COBOLNET1708 in EVERY data description entry — level 1 and 77
      *> included. The antecedent SR20 forbids can therefore never be
      *> constructed and the prohibition cannot be violated: kb/Work
      *> PB371's landed vacuously-satisfied CONFORMS shape.
      *>
      *> ⛔ AND IT STOPS PASSING THE DAY THE ROW NEEDS RE-ADJUDICATING.
      *> kb/Work PB283 (the A.4.14 posture) is OPEN. If VALIDATE is
      *> ever claimed, the clause is admitted and this level-1 entry
      *> must then be diagnosed on SR20's own ground rather than by the
      *> decline; COBOLNET1708 stops being the answer and this fixture
      *> goes red — which is exactly what PB371 requires of a vacuity
      *> witness and exactly what the level-05 fixture cannot do.
      *>
      *> EDITIONS. The validation-clauses group enters at COBOL-2002
      *> (grammar arm `{is2002()}? validationClause`), so at --std 85
      *> the same source is an ordinary syntax error rather than this
      *> decline and the rule has no 85 leg; the reject-at header names
      *> 2002, 2014 and 2023 only.
