*> reject-at: 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 8.3.2.2, FIRST sentence - an outermost PROGRAM definition and a FUNCTION definition in one
*> compilation group externalize the same name: "Within a run unit, all instances of a given name that is
*> externalized to the operating environment shall identify the same kind of entity or item." Its list item 1
*> puts BOTH kinds in the externalized population ("program-names of outermost programs, object-class-names,
*> function-prototype-names, interface-names, method-names, program-prototype-names, property-names, and
*> user-function-names"), so a program and a function under one name are two KINDS under one name.
*> The SAME-kind sentence of the same clause governs two programs or two functions and is pinned by
*> pb660-duplicate-outermost-externalized-name.cob - one clause, one check (COBOLNET2213), two messages.
*> Measured before kb/Work PB660: both registered and both ran (the run-unit table discriminates on a
*> Node.IsFunction flag), so FUNCTION PBSAME returned 0007 and CALL "PBSAME" printed PROGRAM-RAN in one run.
*> reject-at begins at 2002 because a user-defined FUNCTION-ID definition is a COBOL-2002 introduction.
