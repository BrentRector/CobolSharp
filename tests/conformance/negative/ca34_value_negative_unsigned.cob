*> CA34 (CONFORMANCE-FIX-QUEUE): a signed (negative) numeric literal in a VALUE clause requires a signed numeric
*> or sign-bearing numeric-edited subject (ISO 13.18.63.3 SR3). PIC 99 is UNSIGNED (no S), so VALUE -5 is rejected
*> (COBOLNET1625). Pre-fix it silently seeded -5 into an unsigned native field. Edition-invariant (85/2002/2014/2023).
