*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.2 SR8 sentence 1 - "Format 1 shall be specified only for an indexed file."
*> The RECORD KEY clause appears ONLY in the 12.4.5.1 Format 1 (indexed) file control entry, so
*> writing it specifies Format 1; this entry's ORGANIZATION clause says SEQUENTIAL, so the file is
*> not an indexed file. Before kb/Work PB742 this compiled with zero diagnostics of any severity:
*> the key name resolved, was stored on the FileModel, and then nothing read it, because every key
*> consumer is on a path a sequential file never enters.
*> Edition-invariant: the RECORD KEY clause and its format rule predate COBOL-85 and no
*> docs/VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE.md row touches 12.4.5.2, so all four editions reject.
