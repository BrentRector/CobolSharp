*> ISO 1989:2023 8.3.3.6.3 SR3: "If the length of literal-1 is greater than one, it is not permitted to be

*> kb/Work PB422: this is NOT 14.9.25.3 SR5 - SR5's digit-only exception has no length qualifier, so ALL "57"
*> is inside what SR5 permits and only SR3 bars it. It rode SR5's 2023 removal row, which accepted it silently
