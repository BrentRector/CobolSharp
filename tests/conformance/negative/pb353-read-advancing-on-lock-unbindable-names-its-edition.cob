      *> reject-at: 85
      *> kb/Work PB353. An edition gate keyed on a BOUND NODE'S SHAPE is silently un-gated on every path
      *> that bails out before the node is built: a written construct's PARSE node is always present, but
      *> the bound node it would have produced is dropped (BoundUnsupported / BoundNop) the moment the
      *> binder refuses the statement, so an introduction gate must fire on RECOGNITION. Each program in
      *> this family violates a SECOND rule as well, so the binder refuses it before the bound node exists;
      *> a per-edition compiler must still name the edition of the post-85 construct that was WRITTEN.
      *> Measured before the fix: each of these reported its other error ALONE at --std 85.
      *> HERE: 14.9.30.2 prints ADVANCING ON LOCK as its own bracket - the THIRD printed spelling of the
      *> 2002 record-lock introduction, and the one whose gate stayed on the BOUND arm while IGNORING
      *> LOCK and the retention phrase gated on recognition beside it, so one construct id fired from
      *> BOTH arms. The direction here is the version-invariant NEXT, which isolates the lock phrase as
      *> the only post-85 construct under test; the file-name resolves to nothing, so KeyedIoBinder
      *> returns before BoundKeyedRead.AdvancingOnLock is ever assigned.
