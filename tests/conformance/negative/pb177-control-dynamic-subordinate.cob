      *> item SUBORDINATE to an OCCURS DYNAMIC entry - subject to that entry's OCCURS clause. Its sibling
      *> witness pb177-control-dynamic-table names the table ITSELF; both escaped the first cut of the SR3 arm

      *> of the compile-time rejection a SYNTAX rule requires. The two are separate witnesses because SR7 can
      *> cover neither and the SR5 arm (occurs-DEPENDING) reaches neither: 8.5.1.12.1's "variable-length group"
      *> is about SUBORDINATES, and OdoModel.TableUnder matches only OccursSpec.DependingName.
