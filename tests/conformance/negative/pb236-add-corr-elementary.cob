*> national group items, variable-length groups, or strongly-typed group items and shall not be described
*> with level-number 66." ELEM is elementary, so the statement violates SR6 and 4.2.2 paragraph 2 puts the
*> verdict in the COMPILE-TIME mechanism. Before PB236 the binder had the predicate AND the citation and
*> still returned BoundUnsupported, so this program compiled clean and threw
*> NotImplementedCobolFeatureException - telling the programmer THE COMPILER was incomplete when the SOURCE
*> was wrong - and only if the statement was reached.
