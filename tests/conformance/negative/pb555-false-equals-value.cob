*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> kb/Work PB555 — arm: ISO 13.18.63.3 SR27, FIRST SENTENCE (the unconditional one).
*> "The value of literal-4 shall not be equal to the value of any occurrence of literal-2."
*> That sentence carries NO class qualifier and NO THROUGH precondition, so it applies to a plain
*> singleton VALUE list like this one. literal-4 = 1 is literal-2, so `SET CN TO FALSE` would place a
*> value for which 13.18.63.4 GR20's own NOTE 3 says the condition is TRUE — the statement would be a
*> no-op that reads as a state change. COBOLNET2048.
*> Rejected at 85 as well, and the .err deliberately pins the SR27 TEXT rather than a code: at 85 the
*> phrase ALSO draws COBOLNET0900 (a COBOL-2002 introduction, row value-false-phrase-2002), so this
*> case fails the day the introduction gate starts SHORT-CIRCUITING the syntax-rule screen behind it —
*> a syntax rule applies to source as written at every edition. MEASURED at all four.
