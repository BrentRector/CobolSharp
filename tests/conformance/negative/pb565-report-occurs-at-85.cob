*> reject-at: 85
*> ⛔ THE REPORT GROUP DESCRIPTION ENTRY GAINED ITS OCCURS CLAUSE AT COBOL-2002 (kb/Work PB565).
*> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §13.18.38.2 prints the report-writer OCCURS as format 3 — "OCCURS [ integer-1 TO ]
*> integer-2 TIMES [ DEPENDING ON data-name-1 ] [ STEP integer-3 ]" — and §13.15.2's report group description
*> entry general format carries it. The COBOL-85 report group description entry had no OCCURS clause at all,
*> which is why its whole repeating-entry family enters at 2002 together: the multiple LINE clause and the
*> multiple/relative COLUMN forms (§13.18.35.3 / §13.18.14.3 SR10), the VARYING clause (§13.18.64), the
*> PRESENT WHEN clause (§13.18.41) — each already a `*-2002` construct row here — and this.
*>
*> So a COBOL-85 compilation shall name the edition rather than silently repeat the item: construct
*> `report-occurs-2002`, diagnostic COBOLNET0900. Above 85 the same source compiles and prints OK OK OK.
