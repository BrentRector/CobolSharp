      *> specified for a data item of class object or pointer."
      *> kb/Work PB231 (the pointer third): this shape USED to be
      *> rejected - by COBOLNET1695's EXTERNAL twin, i.e. "recognized
      *> but not yet implemented", which is a different verdict about a
      *> different thing. Opening the byte-window carriage gate to
      *> pointer-class leaves would have made a NONCONFORMING program
      *> compile clean: an under-rejection created by a fix. So the rule
      *> that actually bars it is screened in the same change set, and
      *> this fixture is what keeps it screened.
      *> THE RULE NAMES THE ITEM'S OWN CLASS. 13.18.60.4 GR23 makes a
      *> USAGE POINTER entry "a data-pointer data item", and 8.5.2 puts
      *> it in class pointer - so EP is barred. A strongly-typed
      *> EXTERNAL group holding a pointer MEMBER is class alphanumeric
      *> and is NOT barred by SR4 (13.18.22.3 SR5 asks only that its
      *> type declaration also be external); that legal shape runs in
      *> the positive corpus, so this fixture cannot be satisfied by
      *> refusing pointers under EXTERNAL wholesale.
      *> The EXTERNAL clause is a COBOL-85 element, but USAGE POINTER
      *> is a COBOL-2002 introduction, so at --std 85 the program draws
      *> the edition gate (COBOLNET0900) instead and the reject-at list
      *> names the three editions where SR4 is the reason.
