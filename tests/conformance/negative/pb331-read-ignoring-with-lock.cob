      *> statement as the IGNORING LOCK phrase."
      *> !! NOTHING IMPLEMENTED THIS RULE BEFORE kb/Work PB331. The pair was unwritable
      *> only because the grammar had merged 14.9.30.2's TWO printed lock brackets into
      *> one slot - a collapse that ALSO rejected the LEGAL pair IGNORING LOCK WITH NO
      *> LOCK, which 14.9.30.4 GR11 b)/d) distinguish by naming "the NO LOCK phrase" and
      *> "the LOCK phrase" as different phrases. Splitting the brackets is what makes
      *> this file necessary: without the COBOLNET1818 check the split would have opened
      *> a silent hole. 2002/pb331_read_lock_brackets is its permitted-pair twin.
      *> The rule is edition-invariant, hence all four editions; below 2002 the phrases
      *> additionally draw the COBOLNET0900 introduction gate.
