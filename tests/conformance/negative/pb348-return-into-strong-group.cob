*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.34.4 general rule 5 b): "The current record is moved from the record area to
*> the area specified by identifier-1 according to the rules for the MOVE statement without the
*> CORRESPONDING phrase."  Those rules include 14.9.25.3 syntax rule 2, which with 8.5.3.3 requires
*> the sending operand of a MOVE whose receiver is a strongly-typed group to be a group item of the
*> SAME type.  The SD record area here is an ordinary group, so the move is invalid and the RETURN
*> is refused (COBOLNET1533).
*> Before kb/Work PB348 this program compiled and ran silently while the identical MOVE written out
*> explicitly was rejected -- the INTO move was built in the emitter and no bind pass ever saw it.
*> 85 is not listed: TYPEDEF and the STRONG phrase are 2002 introductions, so the 1985 leg is
*> refused by the edition gate rather than by GR5 b).
