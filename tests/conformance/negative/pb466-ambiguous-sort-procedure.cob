*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> kb/Work PB466 - the SORT INPUT PROCEDURE / OUTPUT PROCEDURE phrases, the last pair of operand positions
*> that enter the one procedure-name resolution step. ISO 14.9.40.2 prints procedure-name-1 through
*> procedure-name-4, and 8.4.2.2.1's "uniqueness shall be established through qualification for each
*> user-defined name explicitly referenced" reaches each of them; rule 1 is false for DUP-FEED and DUP-DRAIN,
*> which S-ONE and S-TWO both declare, and rule 6 cannot excuse a reference written in S-MAIN, which declares
*> neither.
*> The SORT phrases are worth their own witness because their operand is a RANGE, not a point (14.9.40.4: the
*> input procedure is executed as though it were "the range of a PERFORM statement"), so an arbitrary pick
*> selects which span of the program feeds or drains the sort - and the sort still completes, with different
*> data and no diagnostic. Rejected at all four editions: 8.4.2.2.1 is unchanged across them.
