      *> "<u>FUNCTION</u> <u>PI</u>" is TWO required words and NOTHING
      *> else - no parentheses, no argument, and nothing bracketed. It
      *> is the shape a "the parenthesised group is optional" grammar
      *> makes hardest to enforce, because the group is genuinely
      *> optional for 15.75.2 RANDOM, so what forbids an argument to
      *> PI is 15.3's "The definition of a function specifies the
      *> number of arguments required, which may be zero" - and PI's
      *> definition specifies zero.
