      *> of the same single argument position that conformance:negative/l1-numvalf-arity pins in the
      *> excess direction. The figure prints exactly ONE argument position: no repetition brace, no
      *> bracketed second position, and nothing making the one position optional. §15.3 opens "The
      *> definition of a function specifies the number of arguments required, which may be zero, one, or
      *> more" — and §15.69.2 IS that definition — so the count in the figure is a bound in BOTH
      *> directions, and a reference supplying none is not a NUMVAL-F reference. COBOLNET1504
