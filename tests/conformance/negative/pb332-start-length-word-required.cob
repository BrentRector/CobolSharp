      *> ISO 14.9.41.2 prints `[ WITH LENGTH arithmetic-expression-1 ]` with LENGTH UNDERLINED.
      *> 5.2.2: an underlined uppercase word is a KEYWORD and is "required in order to select the
      *> functionality associated with that keyword". PB332 made WITH optional because it is NOT
      *> underlined; LENGTH is, so dropping LENGTH is not conforming source. 4.2.2 requires a
      *> mechanism "to indicate violations of the general formats and the explicit syntax rules of
      *> standard COBOL", and strict mode is where this compiler provides it. This file is the
      *> guard on that asymmetry: it writes the optional word and omits the required one.
