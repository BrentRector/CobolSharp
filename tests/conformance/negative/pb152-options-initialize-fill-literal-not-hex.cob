*> ISO 11.9.10.3 SR1 (kb/Work PB152): "Literal-1 shall specify a one-byte hexadecimal-alphanumeric
*> literal."
*>
*> ⛔ "Hexadecimal-alphanumeric literal" is a DEFINED TERM, not loose wording for "a short quoted
*> literal". 8.3.3.2.2 gives the alphanumeric literal exactly TWO general formats - format 1 ("..."
*> or '...') and format 2 (X"..." or X'...') - and "hexadecimal-alphanumeric" names FORMAT 2. So a
*> one-character format-1 literal is NOT admitted however short it is; X"5A" is the conforming
*> spelling of the same byte. This is the one place a natural reading of SR1 diverges from what it
*> says, and it is why the rule needed reading rather than paraphrasing.
*>
*> Measured before the screen: the decoder took raw[0] for ANY shape, so this compiled and silently
*> filled with 'Z'.
