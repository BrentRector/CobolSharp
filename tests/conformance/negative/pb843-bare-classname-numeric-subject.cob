      *> kb/Work PB843. A BARE class-name selection object is 14.9.13.3 SR5's "class condition without the
      *> identifier", and SR8 splices the selection subject in as that identifier - so the class condition's
      *> own operand rules apply to the SUBJECT. 8.8.4.4.3 SR4: "ALPHABETIC, ALPHABETIC-LOWER,
      *> ALPHABETIC-UPPER, or class-name-1 shall not be specified if the category of the data item referenced
      *> by identifier-1 is boolean, numeric, or numeric-edited." WS-N is numeric. Before PB843 the bare word
      *> bound as identifier-2 and drew "'MY-DIG' is not defined" - the right verdict for the wrong reason.
