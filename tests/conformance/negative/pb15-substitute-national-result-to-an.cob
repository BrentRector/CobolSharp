*> PB15: FUNCTION SUBSTITUTE over a NATIONAL argument-1 returns a NATIONAL result (ISO 15.87.1 result-type
*> table), so moving that result to an alphanumeric receiver is invalid (14.9.25.3 SR10, Table 16).
*> SUBSTITUTE is the SECOND bespoke bind path (the [ANYCASE][FIRST|LAST] argument-2/argument-3 pairs) that
*> built its own node with a hardcoded alphanumeric category - the same arm TRIM had. Both are fixed by the
*> ONE IntrinsicResultType.Resolve call, not by two more special cases.
