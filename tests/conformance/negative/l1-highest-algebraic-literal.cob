      *> THE DATA-ITEM CONJUNCT. A numeric literal is of category numeric (§8.3.3, §8.5.2.1's closing "The
      *> class and category of a literal are defined in 8.3.3"), so a screen written on CATEGORY ALONE lets
      *> it through — and then §15.43.4 r2 has nothing to compute: "the positive algebraic value of greatest
      *> finite magnitude that may be represented in ARGUMENT-1" is a property of a data description entry,
      *> and a literal has none. Folding 999 to 999 would look plausible and be meaningless, which is the
      *> failure mode this fixture exists to make loud.
