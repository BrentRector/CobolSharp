*> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §13.4.5.3 syntax rule 7: "Format 2 is the file description entry for

*> entries shall be associated with the file description entry."
*> SR3's permission to omit them is a FORMATS 1 AND 2 rule; SR7 takes it back for INDEXED
*> alone, because §12.4.5.12.3 SR2 requires the RECORD KEY operand to "reference a data
*> item ... within a record description entry associated with the file-name specified in
*> this file control entry" -- and there is none here.
*> The RELATIVE twin of this same shape is LEGAL and is exercised positively by
