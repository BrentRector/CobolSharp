      *> ISO 14.9.13.3 SR3, sentence 2: "If literal-3 or identifier-3 is of class national, alphabet-name-1
      *> shall reference an alphabet that defines a national collating sequence; otherwise, alphabet-name-1
      *> shall reference an alphabet that defines an alphanumeric collating sequence." AL is declared by a plain
      *> ALPHABET clause, so it defines the ALPHANUMERIC sequence (12.3.6 SR1/SR2 make the two domains

      *> there, so the program is refused for a different rule at that edition.
