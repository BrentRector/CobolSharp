      *> ISO 8.4.2.3.2's subscript general format is exactly three alternatives -
      *> ALL, arithmetic-expression-1, index-name-1 [{+|-} integer-1] - so a bare
      *> data-name subscript is admitted ONLY as arithmetic-expression-1, and
      *> 8.8.1.1 then admits only "an identifier referencing a NUMERIC data item,
      *> a numeric literal, the figurative constant ZERO". 8.5.2.1 Table 2 puts
      *> category alphanumeric in class ALPHANUMERIC.
      *> THE ARM PB155 COULD NOT REACH: a SIMPLE subscript name resolves in
      *> ReferenceResolver.ResolveSubscriptName and renders CobolTable.Occ(...)
      *> straight from the token, so the expression binder's screen never ran.
