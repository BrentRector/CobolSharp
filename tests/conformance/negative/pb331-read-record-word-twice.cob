      *> ISO 14.9.30.2 Format 1 (PDF page 722, RENDERED) prints the optional word
      *> RECORD exactly ONCE - `READ file-name-1 { NEXT | PREVIOUS } RECORD [ INTO
      *> identifier-1 ]` - and 5.2.1 admits only the sequence the general format gives.
      *> 5.2.3 makes a non-underlined word one that "may be specified" or omitted, not
      *> one that may be repeated.
      *> It compiled until kb/Work PB331 because the one optional word was written in
      *> TWO grammar places: `readDirection : (NEXT|PREVIOUS) RECORD?` and the
      *> statement's own `RECORD?`. Neither spelling alone is wrong; having both is,
      *> and no test could see it because both single-RECORD spellings still parse.
