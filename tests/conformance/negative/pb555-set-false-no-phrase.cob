*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> kb/Work PB555 — arm: ISO 14.9.39.3 SR7. "If the FALSE phrase is specified, the FALSE phrase shall
*> be specified in the VALUE clause of the data description entry for condition-name-1."
*> 14.9.39.4 GR7 places "the literal in the FALSE phrase of the VALUE clause associated with
*> condition-name-1" in the conditional variable; with no such phrase there is no value to place, and
*> the standard states no default — 13.18.63.4 GR20's NOTE 3 says so in terms ("The WHEN SET TO FALSE
*> phrase specifies just one of possibly many false values"), so the processor cannot choose one.
*> COBOLNET2049.
*> Rejected at 85 as well: SET ... TO FALSE is itself a COBOL-2002 introduction (row
*> set-condition-false-2002), so below 2002 COBOLNET0900 joins it — and the .err pins the SR7 TEXT so
*> the case fails if the introduction gate ever short-circuits the syntax-rule screen. MEASURED at all
*> four editions.
