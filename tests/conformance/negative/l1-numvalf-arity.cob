      *> underlined (required words) and the format has exactly ONE argument position: no repetition brace,
      *> no bracketed second position, no keyword phrase. §15.3 opens with "The definition of a function
      *> specifies the number of arguments required, which may be zero, one, or more", and §15.69.2 is that
      *> definition — so a two-argument reference is not a NUMVAL-F reference at all. COBOLNET1504.
