*> kb/Work PB443 - ISO 8.4.2.2.1: "Qualification of a user-defined name is required unless ... no other
*> name has the identical spelling." Two groups each declare a table E, and identifier-1 is written
*> unqualified, so the reference identifies no single resource (8.4.2.1). Before PB443 the binder read
*> only the base word and took candidates.FirstOrDefault(IsTable), so this compiled clean and searched
*> whichever E was declared FIRST - a silent wrong answer decided by declaration order. The qualified
*> spellings, which are the ones the standard admits, are in tests/conformance/85/pb443_search_identifier_1.
