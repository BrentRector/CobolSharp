*> reject-at: 2023
*> THE WITNESS FOR SR-14.9.30.3-5, one of the seven vacuously-satisfied rules kb/Work PB371 raised (owner
*> decision 2026-09-02: CONFORMS, witnessed by the refusal of the antecedent).
*> THE RULE (ISO 14.9.30.3 SR5, inside the format-1 sublist): "If file-name-1 is subject to an APPLY COMMIT
*> clause, none of the phrases IGNORING LOCK, WITH LOCK, or WITH NO LOCK shall be specified."
*> READ and its record-locking phrases are CLAIMED; the APPLY COMMIT clause is Annex A.4.3 item 2 and is
*> refused by name (COBOLNET1709), so the antecedent is unreachable and the rule holds.
*> ⚠ NOT to be confused with the neighbouring SR-14.9.30.3-4, whose antecedent is "If automatic locking has
*> been specified for file-name-1" - a LOCK MODE condition that IS reachable, with live content of its own.
*> The two rules forbid the same three phrases under different antecedents; only this one is vacuous.
