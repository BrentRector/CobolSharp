      *> ISO 8.4.3.2.3 SR6 in the FUNCTION-keyword form for a function that REQUIRES its argument: UPPER-CASE
      *> (15.97) permits arguments, so the '(' after its name is ALWAYS the argument list and `1:4` is not an
      *> argument (SR8). Before PB61 the empty argument list bound FIRST and reported "takes 1 argument(s); 0
      *> given" (COBOLNET1504) - an arity error about a list the user never wrote - and only RANDOM (MinArgs 0)
      *> reached the SR6 verdict. SR6 is decided from the DEFINITION, before any argument binds.
