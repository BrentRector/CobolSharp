      *> index-name to five - a subscript, PERFORM VARYING, SEARCH VARYING, SET,
      *> and an operand in a relation condition. The termination-status phrase is
      *> not among them, and 8.4.3.1.2 makes an index-name not an identifier, so
      *> 14.9.42.3 SR2's identifier-1 cannot be one either. The R16 screen for
      *> exactly this rule already existed and was simply not applied here.
