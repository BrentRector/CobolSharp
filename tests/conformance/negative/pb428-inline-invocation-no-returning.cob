      *> ISO §8.4.3.4.1 makes an inline method invocation a REFERENCE to "a
      *> temporary data item returned from invocation of a method", and
      *> §8.4.3.4.4 GR1 b) describes that temporary entirely in terms of "the
      *> RETURNING parameter in the specification of the method identified by
      *> literal-1".  §14.8.3.1 states the same obligation from the other
      *> side: "A returning item is implicitly specified in the activating

      *> A method whose procedure division header declares no
      *> RETURNING item therefore has nothing for the identifier to reference
