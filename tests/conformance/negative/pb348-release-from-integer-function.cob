*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.32.3 syntax rule 2: "If identifier-1 is a function-identifier, it shall
*> reference an alphanumeric or national function."  FUNCTION LENGTH is an INTEGER function
*> (14.9.32.3 SR2 names the admitted set; 15.2 item 5 defines the integer functions), so it is
*> outside the admitted set at EVERY edition -- the rule is version-invariant and carries no
*> edition qualifier.
*> Until kb/Work PB348 the FROM phrase applied no rule of its own: SequentialIoBinder.WriteSource
*> bound the operand for WRITE, REWRITE and RELEASE alike and INSPECTED NOTHING, and the implicit
*> MOVE 14.9.32.4 GR4 a) makes of the phrase was then constructed in the EMITTER, downstream of
*> every bind-time screen.  This program compiled clean and printed R=[8       ] -- the value moves,
*> which is exactly why an under-reject in this position is invisible in a run.
