      *> reject-at: 85
      *> kb/Work PB668, COBOLNET2211. COBOL-85's OPEN general format
      *> writes REVERSED in the INPUT group ONLY (VERSION_CHANGE_
      *> REFERENCE row 7.12; this repository holds no 1985 text, so the
      *> rule comes from that row plus the surveyed implementations).
      *> The phrase's whole effect is a RETRIEVAL DIRECTION, and OUTPUT,
      *> I-O and EXTEND have no READ of the created/extended file for it
      *> to apply to. The group below is OUTPUT, so the phrase is not
      *> admissible even though the file is record sequential and the
      *> organization rule (COBOLNET2210) is satisfied - the two rules
      *> are independent and each needs its own witness, exactly as
      *> 14.9.27.3 SR5 and SR6 do for the sibling WITH NO REWIND.
      *> reject-at is 85 ALONE because at 2002 and later the phrase is
      *> refused first, by open-reversed-removed-2002 (COBOLNET0902).
