      *> BOOLEAN is not a reserved word in COBOL-85, so below 2002 the class condition's user-defined-word
      *> alternative claims it and the word can only name an alphabet-name-1 or a class-name-1. Here it
      *> names neither, so it identifies no resource - ISO 8.4.2.1, "In order to use a resource, a statement
      *> shall contain a reference that uniquely identifies that resource" (COBOLNET1639).
