*> PB15: FUNCTION TRIM over a NATIONAL argument-1 returns a NATIONAL result (ISO 15.96.1 result-type table:
*> Alphabetic->Alphanumeric, Alphanumeric->Alphanumeric, National->National), so moving that result to an
*> alphanumeric receiver is invalid (14.9.25.3 SR10, Table 16, National row / AN column = No; FUNCTION
*> DISPLAY-OF is the sanctioned narrowing).
*>
*> TRIM IS THE ONE THAT PROVES THE CATALOG ROW ALONE IS NOT THE FIX. It has a BESPOKE bind path (the
*> LEADING/TRAILING phrase), so it builds its own bound node and never reached the generic result-type
*> resolution - the two-arm dispatch, in its silent form. Pre-fix this compiled clean.
