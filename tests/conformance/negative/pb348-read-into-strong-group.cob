*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.30.4 general rule 4 b) is the SAME SENTENCE as 14.9.34.4 GR5 b): "The current
*> record is moved from the record area to the area specified by identifier-1 according to the rules
*> for the MOVE statement without the CORRESPONDING phrase."  So READ ... INTO a strongly-typed
*> group from an ordinary record area is refused for the same reason its RETURN sibling is
*> (14.9.25.3 SR2 / 8.5.3.3, COBOLNET1533).
*> This fixture exists because the READ arm and the RETURN arm are DIFFERENT CALL SITES -- and the
*> sequential READ and the keyed READ are two more.  kb/Work PB348 binds all four through one
*> MoveBinder.BindIntoPhrase call so they cannot disagree; this is the assertion that they do not.
