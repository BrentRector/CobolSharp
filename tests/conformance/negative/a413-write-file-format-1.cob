*> ISO 1989:2023 Annex A.4.13 item 2) "WRITE FILE file-name-1 (14.9.51)" - the FILE phrase of the WRITE
*> statement, an OPTIONAL language element (4.2.7) for which this implementation claims NO support
*> (docs/CONFORMANCE.md section 5, row A.4.13). Refused by name with COBOLNET1706.
*> This is 14.9.51.2 FORMAT 1 (sequential organization; 14.9.51.3 rule 2 requires format 1 there).
*> WHAT THIS WITNESS ACTUALLY PINS: until 2026-09-02 this exact program COMPILED CLEAN and RAN, because
*> the binder carried a live file-name arm that wrote the whole record area through FileModel.AreaRecord -
*> undeclared support for an unclaimed module, and not even the standard's own model (14.9.51.4 GR8 derives
*> the implicit record from the DESCRIPTION OF identifier-1, not from the largest record's view). So the
*> `.err` code is not decoration: run this fixture against the pre-fix compiler and the runner's
*> Assert.False(ok) is what reds. The section-5 note that called it "no surface - a parse error today" was
*> false on both arms.
