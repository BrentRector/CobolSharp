      *> The REJECT half of conformance:2002/pb428_inline_method_invocation.
      *> An inline method invocation (ISO §8.4.3.4 — the §8.4.3.1.2 Format 4
      *> identifier) belongs to the object-orientation facility, which this
      *> compiler gates at COBOL-2002 throughout. THE EDGE IS DERIVED, NOT
      *> QUOTED (the repo holds no 2002 or 2014 text): §A.4.10 lists exactly
      *> three OPTIONAL object-orientation elements and inline method
      *> invocation is NOT among them, so it is mandatory OO surface; Annex E
      *> itemizes the 2014→2023 delta and does not list it; and §8.4.3.4.4 GR1 defines the
      *> construct as the equivalent INVOKE statement, itself a 2002
      *> introduction.  kb/Work PB428.
      *> ⛔ THE POINT OF THIS FIXTURE IS THAT THE EDITION IS NAMED. Before the
      *> fix the §8.7.4 invocation operator '::' had no lexer token at all, so
      *> the construct drew three raw COBOL0001 errors about a colon at EVERY
      *> edition — and the superseded construct row recorded exactly that as a
      *> permanent residue ("no distinctive token"). '::' IS a distinctive
      *> token, so the below-2002 answer is COBOLNET0900 naming the construct.
      *> The .err names 0900; the same compile also draws 0900 for REPOSITORY
      *> CLASS, INVOKE, USAGE OBJECT REFERENCE and the CLASS-ID unit, which is
      *> expected — every one of them is the same 2002 OO band.
