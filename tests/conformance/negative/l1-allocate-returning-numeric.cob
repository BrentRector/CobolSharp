*> ISO 14.9.3.3 SR3 - "Data-name-2 shall reference a data item of category data-pointer."  FORMAT-1 arm
*> (ALLOCATE arithmetic-expression-1 CHARACTERS ... RETURNING data-name-2, 14.9.3.2): the RETURNING receiver
*> here is category NUMERIC, and 13.18.60.4 GR23 makes category data-pointer the property of a USAGE POINTER
*> entry - "A data description entry that specifies the USAGE POINTER clause specifies a data-pointer data
*> item" - so L1N cannot satisfy SR3 and the statement is not a conforming ALLOCATE.  SR2 is satisfied (the
*> RETURNING phrase IS specified, as CHARACTERS requires), so this fixture isolates SR3 alone.
