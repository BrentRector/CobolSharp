*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.41.3 SR3 - relational-operator "is a relational operator specified in the
*> general-relation format of 8.8.4.2, Simple relation conditions, with the exception of the
*> relational operators 'IS NOT EQUAL TO' or 'IS NOT='". 8.8.4.2.2 Format 1 prints the optional NOT
*> on GREATER THAN, >, LESS THAN, <, EQUAL TO and = ONLY: IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO carries no NOT
*> bracket, so NOT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO is not an alternative of the format and SR3 forbids it in
*> a START. The compiler used to accept it and fold it into '>' (kb/Work PB333).
