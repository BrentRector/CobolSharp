      *> ISO §15.40.3 r1 admits "a national or alphanumeric literal" for
      *> argument-1, and §15.40.1's type table makes the FUNCTION's type
      *> follow it: "National | National". So a NATIONAL format literal makes
      *> FORMATTED-DATETIME a national function, and §14.9.25.3 rule 10's

      *> THIS IS THE LINE THAT MAKES r1's NATIONAL LEG OBSERVABLE. Table 16's
      *> Alphanumeric sending row gives National "Yes", so the positive
