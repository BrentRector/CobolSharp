      *> reject-at: 2014 2023
      *> ISO 13.18.16.3 SR3: "Data-name-1 shall not be subject to any OCCURS clauses." The operand here IS the
      *> OCCURS DYNAMIC entry - 13.18.38.2 Format 4 (dynamic-capacity-table) is a form of the OCCURS clause, so
      *> the entry is subject to one. kb/Work PB177 arm C's first cut spelled the SR3 arm `n.Occurs is not null`,
      *> and DataItem.Occurs is the FIXED physical capacity - NULL for a Format-4 table - so this shape escaped
      *> the compile-time screen entirely. Measured: it compiled clean and reached ReportWriterEmitter's runtime
      *> loud, where a SYNTAX rule requires the compile-time rejection.
      *> ⛔ SR7 STRUCTURALLY CANNOT COVER THIS ONE, which is why it needs its own witness: 8.5.1.12.1 defines a
      *> "variable-length group" over items SUBORDINATE to the group, so the dynamic table ENTRY ITSELF is never
      *> one - the same subject/subordinate asymmetry 13.18.44.3 SR17 documents. The arm now reads DataItem.IsTable.
