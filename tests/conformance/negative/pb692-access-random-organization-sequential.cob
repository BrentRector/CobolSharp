*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.5.2 syntax rule 2: "The DYNAMIC and RANDOM phrases shall not be
*> specified for a sequential file." F's ORGANIZATION clause says SEQUENTIAL, so the RANDOM
*> phrase is closed out of this entry at every edition -- the general format says the same
*> structurally (Format 3, the sequential file control entry, admits only
*> [ ACCESS MODE IS SEQUENTIAL ]). No VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE row touches 12.4.5.5, and the
*> 1985 sequential I-O file control entry likewise offered no ACCESS MODE but SEQUENTIAL, so
*> all four editions reject. COBOLNET1858 (kb/Work PB692).
