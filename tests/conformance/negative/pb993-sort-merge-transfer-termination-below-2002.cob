      *> SHARING clause that produces it (12.4.5.15; Table 19) is an ISO/IEC
      *> 1989:2002 introduction. At COBOL-85 this source does not describe a
      *> program, so the compiler refuses the clause with COBOLNET0900 rather
      *> than merging over a sharing mode the edition does not have.
