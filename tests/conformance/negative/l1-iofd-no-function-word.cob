      *> (2014/l1_iofd_two_argument_format accepts two; l1-iofd-arity1 and

      *> only in the accepting direction, which is not a test of the requirement —
      *> the sibling row FMT-15.25.2 was overturned CONFORMS -> PARTIAL for that
      *> precise omission, and this row's own recorded evidence rests partly on the
      *> keyword-omitted routing.
      *>
      *> §8.4.3.2.3 SR2 grants the only omission permission — "If intrinsic-
      *> function-name-1 or the ALL phrase is specified in the REPOSITORY paragraph
      *> … the word FUNCTION may be omitted from the function-identifier; otherwise
      *> the word FUNCTION is required" — and this unit has NO REPOSITORY paragraph,
      *> so the permission is withheld and the required word is missing. No data
      *> item of this name is declared either, so the parenthesised group is not a

      *> rule about a different clause.
      *> The accepting side of the PERMISSION is
      *> 2014/l1_repository_bare_intrinsic_names, which writes this same reference
      *> bare under REPOSITORY. FUNCTION ALL INTRINSIC. and requires 0143951.
