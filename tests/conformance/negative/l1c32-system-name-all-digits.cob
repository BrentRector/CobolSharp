      *> docs/CONFORMANCE.md#DOC-A.1-198 documents ONE added restriction: "a system-name
      *> shall not consist of digits only, because such a character-string is always read
      *> as an integer literal (`OBJECT-COMPUTER. 12345.` is a syntax error, `COBOL0001`)".
      *> `12345` is otherwise a legal COBOL word (§8.3.2.1: digits allowed, no hyphen at
      *> either end; the letter requirement of §8.3.2.2 binds user-defined words only), so
      *> this documented restriction is the only reason to reject. The companion positive
      *> l1c32_system_name_formation shows `1-2` and `123ABC` accepted. The diagnostic is
      *> the generic parse code, which is exactly what the documentation names.
