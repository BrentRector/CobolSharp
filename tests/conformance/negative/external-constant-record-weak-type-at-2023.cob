*> reject-at: 2023
*> VCR 16 STRENGTH half (ISO §13.16.3 SR13 ¶2; Annex E.2 item 10; review finding C9):
*> at >=2023 an EXTERNAL CONSTANT RECORD requires a TYPE naming a STRONGLY typed
*> definition. WK here is a WEAK typedef — presence alone passed the earlier gate;
*> the strength half must reject (COBOLNET1549). Below 2023 the requirement did not
*> exist (the 2014 golden external_constant_record_weak_type pins the continuity).
