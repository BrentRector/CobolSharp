*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.12.2, THE CONFORMING MINIMUM SPELLING of the declined key form, and the reason it
*> gets its own fixture: on printed page 359 (folio 329, RENDERED - the OCR'd diagrams were systematically
*> lossy toward falsely-restrictive syntax) only RECORD and SOURCE carry underline rules. KEY and BOTH
*> occurrences of IS are un-underlined, and 8.3.2.4.3 makes such a word one that "may be specified at the
*> user's option with no effect on the semantics of the format" - so "RECORD F-COMPOSITE SOURCE F-K1" is
*> the same clause as the fully-spelled one in pb358-record-key-source, and has to draw the same decline.
*> A grammar that only recognized "RECORD KEY IS ... SOURCE IS ..." would send this spelling back to the
*> generic COBOL0312 parse error while the fully-spelled twin was named - a decline with a hole in it.
*> ONE data-name-2 is also deliberate: 12.4.5.12.2 puts the ellipsis on the inner { data-name-2 } brace
*> pair, so ONE occurrence is the minimum the format admits, and 12.4.5.12.4 GR2's "concatenation of all
*> occurrences" degenerates to a single window - the case a reader might assume is really the data-name-1
*> arm. It is not: record-key-name-1 is a different name class (8.3.2.2.24) and is declined either way.
