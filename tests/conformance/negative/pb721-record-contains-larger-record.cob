*> ISO 13.18.43.3 SR3, the FORMAT 1 (fixed-length) rule: "No record description
*> entry for the file may specify a number of bytes greater than integer-1."
*> F-REC describes 20 bytes and the clause states integer-1 = 10, so the entry is
*> not conforming source. The size compared is 13.18.43.4 GR3's - "the sum of the
*> number of bytes in all fixed length elementary items plus the sum of the maximum
*> number of bytes in any occurs-depending table subordinate to the record".
*> Until kb/Work PB721 nothing screened this rule and the program compiled clean.
