*> ISO 1989:2023 §14.9.51.3 SR3: "If the organization of the write file is indexed or relative, format 2 shall
*> be specified." Format 2 prints no ADVANCING and no END-OF-PAGE phrase, so a print-control phrase on an
*> indexed WRITE is a syntax-rule violation - the mirror of SR2, which already lands on COBOLNET1720. It used
*> to be a COBOLNET1756 deferral ("print-control phrases are for sequential print files") and a run-unit abort.
*> The rule is the same at every edition. COBOLNET1720 (kb/Work PB909).
