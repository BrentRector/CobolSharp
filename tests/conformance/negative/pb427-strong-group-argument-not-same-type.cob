*> ISO 1989:2023 14.8.2.2, the sentence after rules 1 and 2 and qualified by neither of them: "If either
*> the formal parameter or the corresponding argument is a strongly-typed group item, both shall be of
*> the same type."  14.8.3.2 states the same sentence over a RETURNING pair and 9.3.8.2.3 rule 7 over an
*> interface pair; 8.5.1.12.1 says it once more from the other side -- "Two fixed-length groups are
*> always compatible, unless they are strongly typed and have different type definitions."
*> PLAING is an ordinary alphanumeric group of four bytes and LF is a strongly-typed group of four bytes,
*> so every LENGTH-based conformance test the boundary applies is satisfied and only the strongly-typed
*> sentence refuses the crossing.  Before kb/Work PB427 that sentence was implemented NOWHERE: this
*> program compiled and ran, handing a strongly-typed formal an argument of no type at all -- the
*> activation-boundary form of the same integrity breach 8.5.3.3 exists to prevent.
