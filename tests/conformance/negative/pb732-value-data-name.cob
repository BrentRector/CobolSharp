*> kb/Work PB732 — arm: a DEFINED data-name written in a VALUE clause. No general format of the VALUE
*> clause admits an identifier (ISO 13.18.63.2, every operand position is literal-n; verified against the
*> printed figures), so a data-name there is as invalid as a typo, and the diagnostic says which it is.
*> Pre-fix the item silently initialized to the string "DNAME" - the data item's SPELLING, not its value.
