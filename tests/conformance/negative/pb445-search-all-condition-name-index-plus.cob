*> kb/Work PB445 - SEARCH ALL Format 2 (ISO 1989:2023 14.9.37.3 SR7-SR13). Before this item all seven of
*> those syntax rules were unenforced: the binder read the table's index names and occurrence count and
*> nothing key-related, and bound each WHEN through the general condition binder as one opaque expression,
*> so neither the ordered key list nor the WHEN's decomposed operands existed for a rule to be written
*> against. Each of these programs compiled clean and RAN, at every --std.

*> SR9, last sentence: "The index-name subscript shall not be followed by a '+' or a '-'" - the same
*> prohibition SR8 states for a data-name, written again for a condition-name. Both arms are screened; only
*> fixing one of them is this repository's most reproducible defect shape.
