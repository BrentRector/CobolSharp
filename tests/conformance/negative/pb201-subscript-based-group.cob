      *> The SECOND shape kb/Work PB201 names, and the one that proved the defect
      *> was a CARRIER defect and not a class defect: a BASED group has no C#
      *> field of its own name at all, so the bind-time renderer emitted the raw
      *> COBOL word and the backend failed with CS0103 - a DIFFERENT failure from
      *> the WORKING-STORAGE group's CS1503, for source the same two clauses
      *> reject identically. 8.4.2.3.2 + 8.8.1.1 + 8.5.2.1, exactly as in
      *> pb201-subscript-group-item.
      *> reject-at omits 85: the BASED clause is a 2002 addition, so at 85 the
      *> program is rejected for the clause, not for the subscript.
