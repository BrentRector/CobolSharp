      *> kb/Work PB432 — ISO §14.9.28.3 SR3: "Each literal shall be numeric." The varying-phrase's FROM slot
      *> is parsed as a superset of the brace group so the LEGAL figurative ZERO can reach the binder at all
      *> (§8.3.3.6.3 SR1 permits it precisely because SR3 restricts the literal to numeric); the prohibition
      *> half is enforced at bind by the ONE numeric-context literal reading, which names SR3 as the rule that
      *> closes this operand list rather than citing §8.8.1.1 alone.
