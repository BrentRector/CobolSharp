*> reject-at: 2023
*> THE WITNESS FOR SR-12.4.5.9.3-1, one of the seven VACUOUSLY-SATISFIED rules kb/Work PB371 raised and the
*> owner answered 2026-09-02: a syntax rule that constrains a CLAIMED construct but whose ANTECEDENT can only
*> be created by a DECLINED module records CONFORMS, witnessed by a test pinning that the antecedent is
*> refused with a NAMED diagnostic.
*> THE RULE (ISO 12.4.5.9.3 SR1): "This clause shall not be specified for a file that is the subject of an
*> APPLY COMMIT clause for which there is an implicit LOCK MODE IS AUTOMATIC WITH LOCK ON MULTIPLE RECORDS
*> applied automatically, including for sequential files."
*> THE ANTECEDENT is the APPLY COMMIT clause, Annex A.4.3 item 2, which COBOLNET1709 refuses at every site
*> (docs/CONFORMANCE.md section 5, row A.4.3 - Not claimed). So no compilable program can pair a LOCK MODE
*> clause with a file subject to APPLY COMMIT, the rule cannot be violated, and it holds.
*> ⛔ WHY THIS FIXTURE EXISTS RATHER THAN A SHARED ONE. It writes the rule's OWN forbidden pairing - a LOCK
*> MODE clause AND an APPLY COMMIT clause naming the same file - so the day A.4.3 is claimed, this file stops
*> failing and the row's CONFORMS is forced back to a real adjudication. A witness that only wrote APPLY
*> COMMIT alone would keep passing and would silently leave the verdict standing.
