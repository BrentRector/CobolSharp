*> ISO 1989:2023 Annex A.4.13 item 2), FORMAT 2. 14.9.51.2 prints TWO general formats and BOTH carry the
*> same `{ record-name-1 | FILE file-name-1 }` choice (RENDERED, PDF p785 format 1 and p786 format 2);
*> 14.9.51.3 rule 3 requires format 2 for an indexed or relative write file. The sequential witness alone
*> would not have covered this: the binder reroutes keyed organizations to a DIFFERENT method
*> (KeyedIoBinder.BindWrite), so a refusal placed after that reroute would leave the indexed arm silently
*> accepting the unclaimed phrase. The check therefore sits BEFORE the reroute, and this fixture is what
*> proves it (measure the selector's complement: one witness per arm, not one per statement).
