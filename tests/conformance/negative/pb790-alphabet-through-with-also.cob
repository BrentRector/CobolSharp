      *> kb/Work PB790 - ONE ALPHABET literal-phrase entry may carry a THROUGH range OR ALSO operands, never
      *> both.  The literal-phrase figure (ISO 12.3.7.2, RENDERED - PDF p321 / folio 291) stacks
      *> `{THROUGH|THRU} literal-2` and `{ALSO literal-3}...` inside ONE pair of square brackets with no
      *> choice indicators, and 5.2.6.2 lets a bracket supply "one of the alternatives contained within the
      *> brackets".  This entry compiled clean at every edition and the ALSO operand "D" was silently dropped:
      *> it kept an UNSPECIFIED position above "A" (12.3.7.4 GR7 k3) instead of sharing "A"'s, so the IF below
      *> printed ABOVE.  There is no merged reading - GR7 k5 (THROUGH) and k6 (ALSO) place operands by
      *> incompatible rules - so the entry is refused by name: COBOLNET2242.
