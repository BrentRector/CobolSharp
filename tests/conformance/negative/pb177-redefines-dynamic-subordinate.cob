      *> The OTHER side of the COBOLNET1525 -> COBOLNET1698 RECODE, which had no witness at all: a REDEFINES
      *> subject with a DYNAMIC-CAPACITY TABLE subordinate to it. 8.5.1.12.1 makes that a "variable-length
      *> group" - "a group item whose data description has at least one dynamic-length elementary item or
      *> dynamic-capacity table as a subordinate item" - so 13.18.44.3 SR17 rejects it: "Neither data-name-2 nor
      *> the subject of the entry shall be a variable-length group or a dynamic-length elementary item."
      *> ⛔ IT IS THE dynamic-CAPACITY DISJUNCT OF ReferenceResolver.HasVariableLengthSubordinate, WHICH NO
      *> FIXTURE ANYWHERE EXERCISED: every other 8.5.1.12.1 rejection fixture reaches that predicate through
