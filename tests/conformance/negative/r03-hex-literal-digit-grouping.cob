      *> the number of hexadecimal digits that the implementor has specified as
      *> the number of hexadecimal digits that map to an alphanumeric character"
      *> - two, one byte per character. 8.3.3.5.3 rule 5 says the same sentence

      *> BOTH USED TO BE SILENT WRONG ANSWERS (fix-queue R03). The hex decoders
      *> returned "" for a malformed digit count and every caller took that as
      *> the value, so FUNCTION LENGTH(X"414") answered 1 on source the standard
      *> rejects. X"..." had behaved that way since it was introduced; NX"..."
      *> inherited it the moment the token started matching.

      *> ⚠ THE CHECK IS AT BIND, NOT IN THE LEXER, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE: a
      *> lexer rule refusing an odd digit count would not reject the program - the
      *> token would simply fail to match and `X"414"` would split into an
      *> IDENTIFIER and a STRINGLIT, which is the silent degradation R03 exists to
      *> close. The token must match so that something is left to diagnose.
      *>
      *> BX"..." is NOT here on purpose: 8.3.3.4.3 r3 states no grouping rule,
      *> because 8.3.3.4.4 GR5 maps each digit independently to four boolean
      *> characters. Assertions 11-12 of r03_hexadecimal_national_and_boolean_
      *> literals pin that odd BX counts stay legal.
