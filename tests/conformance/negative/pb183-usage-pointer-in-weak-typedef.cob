*> ISO 13.18.60.3 SR14, second arm - THE ONCE-PER-DECLARATION FIXTURE. SR14 admits a subordinate
*> pointer only under "a type declaration that includes the STRONG phrase". W is a WEAK typedef, so
*> WP is nonconforming; and the verdict must land ONCE, at the TEMPLATE, however many TYPE W
*> reference sites exist. Two are written here for exactly that reason: a screen keyed on the
*> post-expansion strong flag rather than on the declaration-side TYPEDEF STRONG would miss the
*> template and then fire once per reference site - wrong site, wrong count, and a diagnostic naming
*> a line the programmer cannot fix.
