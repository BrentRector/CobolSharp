      *> ISO §15.42.2 — the general format is `FUNCTION FRACTION-PART ( argument-1 )`: two underlined words
      *> and ONE parenthesized argument, with no optional element and no repetition. §15.3 makes that format
      *> the authority on the count — "The definition of a function specifies the number of arguments
      *> required, which may be zero, one, or more" — so a two-argument list is not a reference to this
      *> function at all, and there is no other §15.42 format for it to be.
      *>
      *> The ACCEPT side of the same format (the one-argument form, in a MOVE and in a COMPUTE) is pinned by
      *> conformance:2023/l1_integer_family_notes. This is the half that says the format is a CONSTRAINT and
      *> not merely a suggestion; without it, an arity model that silently ignored trailing arguments — or
      *> that treated FRACTION-PART as variadic like MAX — would pass every positive fixture in the corpus.
      *> Expected: COBOLNET1504, the §15.3 argument-count diagnostic.
