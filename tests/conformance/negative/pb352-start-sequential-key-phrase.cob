*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.41.3 SR2 - the KEY-phrase arm of the same rule. SR2 requires FIRST or LAST on a
*> sequential-organization file, and the general format admits at most ONE of FIRST / KEY / LAST, so a
*> KEY phrase here is the same violation as the bare form and shall be reported the same way. The
*> pairing matters: SR2's two spellings used to share ONE early return that reported neither.
