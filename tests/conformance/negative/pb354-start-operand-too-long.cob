*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.41.3 SR6 b) 3. - "Its length is not greater than the length of that record key."
*> IX-LONG begins at the prime key's leftmost character position within a record of the file and has the
*> same class, category and usage, so b) 1. and b) 2. are both satisfied and b) 3. is the ONLY condition
*> left to reject it: nine character positions against a six-character key. Its accept side is
*> conformance:2002/pb354_start_generic_key_ok K3 (a 3-character generic key over the same X(6) key), so
*> the threshold is pinned from both directions.
