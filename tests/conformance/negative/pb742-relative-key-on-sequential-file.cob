*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.2 SR9 sentence 1 - "Format 2 shall be specified only for a relative file."
*> SR8's twin one format over: the RELATIVE KEY clause appears only in the 12.4.5.1 Format 2
*> (relative) entry, so writing it on a sequential file specifies Format 2 for a file the rule does
*> not admit. It is in the same change set as SR8 deliberately: a rule set with one member enforced
*> is exactly the shape in which the missing member hides (kb/Work PB742).
