      *> ISO §13.18.60.2: the USAGE OBJECT REFERENCE general format stacks THREE alternatives
      *> in one bracket pair — interface-name-1 alone, [FACTORY OF] ACTIVE-CLASS, and
      *> [FACTORY OF] object-class-name-1 [ONLY].  ONLY belongs to the THIRD alternative and
      *> to no other, and §13.18.60.4 GR22 c) states the interface reading with no subordinate

      *> for an object-class-name.  The grammar cannot tell an interface-name from an
      *> object-class-name — both are one user-defined word — so it parses the superset and
      *> the binder makes this rejection once the name resolves.
