      *> kb/Work PB830 - the CLOSED ISO 12.3.6.2 general format (RENDERED, PDF p315 / folio 285): the
      *> OBJECT-COMPUTER paragraph is [computer-name-1] followed by the CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION and

      *> Rejected at 85 as well: X3.23-1985's clause list is MEMORY SIZE, PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE
      *> and SEGMENT-LIMIT, and neither word is reserved at any edition.
