      *> TRUE. RuntimeApi.TableOcc renders the OCCURS DEPENDING current-count read
      *> at CODEGEN time, from a Place, so unlike the subscript renderer it cannot
      *> decline a carrier and re-route to D18 - the capability has to be present
      *> for every carrier that can reach it. That set is bounded by exactly one
      *> rule: ISO 13.18.38.3 rule 17, "Data-name-1 shall describe an integer".
      *> With rule 17 enforced, data-name-1 is a non-float, scale-0 numeric item,
      *> so its carrier is long / Int128 / ulong / UInt128 (or the string image a
      *> whole-group promotion may select) - and CobolTable.Occ declares a
      *> parameter for every one of them. Were rule 17 to stop firing, a COMP-2 or
      *> a PIC 9V9 control item would reach Occ with a double / scaled carrier and
      *> the backend would fail with the same CS1503 this item is about.
      *> N-FRAC is numeric and non-float but SCALE 1, so it does not describe an
      *> integer and is rejected at every edition - OCCURS DEPENDING is COBOL-85
      *> and rule 17 has no introduction axis and no dialect gate.
