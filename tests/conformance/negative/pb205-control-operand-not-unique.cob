      *> sentence permits two operands to "refer to the same physical data item
      *> or to overlapping data items", so the referenced item cannot be what
      *> distinguishes them, and 13.18.57.3 SR10 could not name a level
      *> unambiguously if it were. CX(1:3) CX(4:3) in the SAME clause is legal
      *> for that reason and is the positive witness (2023/pb205_control_ref_mod);
      *> the same reference twice is not.
      *> MEASURED BEFORE kb/Work PB205: accepted, building two control levels
