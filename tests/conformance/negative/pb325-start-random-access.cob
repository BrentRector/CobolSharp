*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> kb/Work PB325 - ISO 14.9.27.4 GR8, Table 20 "Permissible I-O statements by access mode and open mode":
*> the Random row's START cells are BLANK in every one of the four open-mode columns, so no open mode makes a
*> START legal on an ACCESS RANDOM connector. The blank row is not a run-time status - unlike WRITE's item-8
*> '48' and REWRITE/DELETE's item-9 '49', 9.1.13.7 names no status for it - because 14.9.41.3 SR1 removes the
*> statement at COMPILE time: "The access mode of the file referenced by file-name-1 shall be either
*> sequential or dynamic."  KeyedIoBinder.BindStart screens it with COBOLNET0862.
*> BOTH keyed organizations are exercised: the screen sits before the organization split, so a
*> one-organization fixture would not show that the relative arm is covered too.
*> The reachable cells of the same table are walked by conformance:2023/l1_table20_seq_relative and
*> conformance:2023/l1_table20_indexed.
