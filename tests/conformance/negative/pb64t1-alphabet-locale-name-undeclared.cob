      *> named IS LOCALE form referencing a name no LOCALE clause declares: the same COBOLNET1664 every reference site
      *> draws, citing its own rule (kb/Work PB64 T1). The program otherwise binds (the alphabet falls back to the
      *> current-locale form) so the diagnostic is the only thing between this source and a compiled program.
      *> The ALPHABET clause is written FIRST, in the 12.3.7.2 format order, and the LOCALE clause after it declares
      *> only ES. Locale-names resolve after the whole paragraph is bound (kb/Work PB1558), so the .err pins
      *> "declared: ES": the refusal is SR24's, not an artifact of which clause came first.
