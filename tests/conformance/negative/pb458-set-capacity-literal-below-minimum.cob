      *> less than the minimum capacity defined in the corresponding OCCURS clause and not greater than the
      *> expected capacity, if specified." 13.18.38.4 GR16 names the minimum capacity ("Integer-4 is the minimum
      *> capacity of the table") and GR17 the expected capacity ("Integer-5 is the expected capacity"), so all
      *> three of SR30's bounds are decidable at compile time from FROM 2 TO 10.
      *> This is a SYNTAX rule over Format 14's LITERAL alternative, so a violation is a refusal. 14.9.39.4

      *> 2 - a DIFFERENT value from the one written, for a program the standard requires the compiler to reject.
