*> reject-at: 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.30.3 syntax rule 2: "If identifier-1 is a strongly-typed group item, there
*> shall be at most one record area subordinate to the FD for file-name-1.  This record area, if
*> specified, shall be a strongly-typed group item of the same type as identifier-1."
*> This FD has TWO record areas, so the rule's COUNT obligation is broken outright -- COBOLNET1995.
*> THE COUNT IS A SEPARATE OBLIGATION FROM THE SAME-TYPE ONE, and only the count needs a screen
*> here.  The rule's second sentence is the same predicate over the same pair that 14.9.25.3 SR2
*> applies to this phrase's implicit-move SENDER -- which IS the record area -- and is reported
*> there, COBOLNET1533 (see pb348-read-into-strong-group).  But that screen inspects only ONE
*> record, FileModel.AreaRecord, so a file whose LARGEST record happened to be a strongly-typed
*> group of the right type passed everything: no diagnostic could see the second area at all.
*> This fixture is the one the same-type screen cannot catch, kept deliberately DISTINCT from its
*> PB348 sibling so that removing either check fails a test.
*> 85 is not listed: TYPEDEF and the STRONG phrase are 2002 introductions, so the 1985 leg is
*> refused by the edition gate (COBOLNET0900) rather than by syntax rule 2.
