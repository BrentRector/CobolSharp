*> reject-at: 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO §14.9.39.3 SR10d2: when the receiver of a SET … TO SELF is described with an interface-name that
*> identifies int-1, and the SET statement is contained in a method within the INSTANCE definition of the
*> class, "that instance definition shall be described with an IMPLEMENTS clause that references int-1".
*> CSELFN's OBJECT implements nothing, so SET R TO SELF — with R described as OBJECT REFERENCE ISELFN —
*> violates SR10d2 and shall be rejected at bind.
*> Before this check the binder looked the receiver's type up with a CLASS-only Find, so an interface-typed
*> receiver matched neither arm and the statement bound clean; the emitter then rendered a raw (ISELFN)(this)
*> cast, which is an InvalidCastException at run time and — for a sealed class — a Roslyn CS error on
*> generated user source, which the no-CS-on-user-source rule forbids.
