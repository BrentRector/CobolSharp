*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.2 SR9 sentence 2, and the case NO KEY-CLAUSE row could ever reach: this
*> entry writes no key clause at all. It specifies 12.4.5.1's Format 2 solely by its ORGANIZATION
*> clause - "[ ORGANIZATION IS ] RELATIVE" appears in Format 2 and nowhere else - while an SD
*> describes the file. That is why the screen has a rule stated about the ENTRY rather than about
*> one operand of it (kb/Work PB742); a per-clause screen would have shipped this silently.
