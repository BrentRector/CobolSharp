*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ⛔ THE OTHER HALF OF §13.18.60.3 SR7, AND THE HALF THAT WAS SILENT (kb/Work PB541). The rule reads
*> "Only the DISPLAY or NATIONAL phrase may be specified in any USAGE clause associated with a report group
*> item." conformance:2002/pb541_report_national_item is the admitted side; this is the excluded side, and
*> it is written on a GROUP entry on purpose.
*>
*> A USAGE clause on a report group entry is "associated with" the report group items under it — that is
*> what §13.18.60.4 GR1 says a group-level USAGE clause IS: "If the USAGE clause is specified or implied at
*> a group level, it applies only to each elementary item in the group." Before this, the report binder
*> captured such a clause and handed it only to the printable LEAF, so a group entry's USAGE clause was
*> silently DISCARDED: this program compiled and RAN, printing 1234 from an item the source said was COMP.
*> A rejection is the only answer the rule allows, and it is edition-invariant — SR7 is in the '85 standard
*> unchanged, and neither COMP nor the report group description entry moved since.
