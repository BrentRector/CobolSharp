*> description entries are specified in a file description entry for a file that is not
*> a report file, the RECORD clause shall be specified."
*> The rule is load-bearing, not decorative: §14.9.30.4 GR6 sizes the implied record
*> description by "the maximum size established by the RECORD clause", so without one
