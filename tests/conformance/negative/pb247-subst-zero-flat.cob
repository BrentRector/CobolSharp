      *> kb/Work PB247 - ISO 15.87.3 r3: "Neither argument-1 nor argument-2 shall be of zero length", on the
      *> table(ALL) bind path. The operand list here is [ "aXbXc", "", "Q", SB2(ALL) ]: the zero-length literal
      *> is pair 1's ARGUMENT-2 and its position is decided entirely before the enumeration is reached, so r3
      *> is decidable at compile time. BindSubstitute returned inside its `if (flat)` block, which sat ABOVE the
      *> odd-position r3 walk, so the whole rule went unenforced the moment any operand was an enumeration -
      *> the two-arm dispatch with one arm fixed. The walk now runs on both exits and advances by each operand's
      *> STATIC element count, stopping only where the run-time count makes the pair role genuinely unknowable.
