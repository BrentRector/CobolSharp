*> An ANY LENGTH formal has no length until it is bound to an argument (13.18.2.4), so a condition-name
*> over it has no fixed-size subject to compare - which is why the rule excludes it rather than leaving the
*> comparison implementor-defined. kb/Work PB488 measured the contained-program spelling compiling and
