*> X3.23-1985 USE FOR DEBUGGING + SOURCE-COMPUTER WITH DEBUGGING MODE — the '85 debug module was deleted by
*> ISO/IEC 1989:2002 and is absent from ISO/IEC 1989:2023 (§8.9 reserved-word table absence @10407-10408; the
*> DEBUG-* register spellings are gone). At --std >=2002 the version-conformance pass rejects both the WITH
*> DEBUGGING MODE clause and the USE FOR DEBUGGING declarative with COBOLNET0902 (registry rows
*> debugging-mode-removed-2002 + use-for-debugging-removed-2002; VCR Table 7 row 7.17). Accepted-and-ACTIVE at
*> --std 85 (the wavef_dbg_proc.cob positive golden).
