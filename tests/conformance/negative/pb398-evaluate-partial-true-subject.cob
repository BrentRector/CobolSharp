      *> ISO 14.9.13.3 SR10 + Table 15: the Partial-expression ROW is blank under the TRUE-or-FALSE column.
      *> SR8's own rewrite says why - it makes the corresponding selection subject "treated as though it were
      *> specified by the word TRUE", which is only meaningful when the subject supplies the expression's
      *> missing leftmost operand; the word TRUE supplies none. The pair is refused at COMPILE time (SR10 is a
      *> syntax rule), never as the run-time fault kb/Work PB47 found for the other blank cells.
