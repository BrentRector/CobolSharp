*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> AN ABSOLUTE LINE IN A REPORT THAT IS NOT DIVIDED INTO PAGES (kb/Work PB1002). ISO/IEC 1989:2023
*> §13.18.35.3 SR5: "If the report is not divided into pages, all its LINE clauses shall be relative." The RD
*> has no PAGE clause, so the report is one page of indefinite length (§13.18.39.4 GR2a) and LINE 3 names a
*> line of no page. It compiled clean before PB1002. A rule of every edition.
