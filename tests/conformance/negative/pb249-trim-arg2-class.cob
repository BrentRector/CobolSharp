      *> kb/Work PB249 - ISO 15.96.3 r2's SECOND sentence at the repeating tail: "When argument-1 is class
      *> alphabetic or alphanumeric, argument-2 shall be a single character that is either class alphabetic or
      *> class alphanumeric. When argument-1 is class national, argument-2 shall be a single character of class
      *> national." Argument-1 here is class alphanumeric and the SECOND argument-2 is a national literal, which
      *> neither sentence admits. The cross-argument screen reached the declared positions only (the schema had
      *> no tail), so this bound clean and mixed the two families inside one delete set.
