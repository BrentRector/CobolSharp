*> ISO 13.18.18 DESTINATION clause - Annex A.4.14 item 3. MEASURED before COBOLNET1708, at every edition:
*> "COBOL0001: no viable alternative at input 'DESTINATION'" - a wholly generic error.
*> (The analysis that proposed this row predicted COBOLNET0901 "'DESTINATION' is a reserved word" here; the
