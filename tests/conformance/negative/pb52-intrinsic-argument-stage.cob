      *> rule has been READ AND CITED. The queue entry named SQRT; COS, SIN, TAN
      *> and SIGN carry the IDENTICAL rule and were equally unscreened, so all
      *> five joined together, each clause read individually.

      *> WATCH THE CLAUSE NUMBER: SQRT is 15.84, NOT 15.81 - 15.81 is SIGN. A
      *> first pass read 15.81.3's "shall be of class numeric" and took it for
      *> SQRT's. The text was real and the clause belonged to another function.

      *> trig family screened?" would have read it as yes, while COS, SIN and TAN
      *> sat unscreened. The gap was never claimed, only implied by a name.
