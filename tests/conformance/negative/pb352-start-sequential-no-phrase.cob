*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.41.3 SR2 - "If the organization of the file referenced by file-name-1 is
*> sequential, either the FIRST or the LAST phrase shall be specified." The general format makes
*> FIRST / KEY / LAST mutually exclusive alternatives of ONE plain bracket (rendered from the printed
*> page - the bracket is optional and at most one alternative is chosen), so on a sequential file the
*> bare START violates SR2 outright. Until kb/Work PB352 this compiled clean and then aborted the run
*> unit with a .NET stack trace, under a message that cited SR2 as the reason for refusing what SR2
*> permits.
