*> reject-at: 85
*> ⛔ THE NEGATIVE BELOW THE INTRODUCING EDITION (kb/Work PB541). §13.18.60.3 SR7 admits a NATIONAL report
*> group item — conformance:2002/pb541_report_national_item is the positive — but national data itself is a
*> COBOL-2002 introduction (ISO §8.5.2, category national), so the same entry at --std 85 is not conforming
*> COBOL-85 and the edition gate refuses it (COBOLNET0900).
*>
*> This is the edition-gate sweep the new SR7 screen owes: widening a usage gate from DISPLAY to
*> DISPLAY-or-NATIONAL must not let a post-85 category through an '85 compilation, and the gate fires on the
*> REPORT ITEM in its own right ("RD 'R-1' printable item …"), not merely on the working-storage item the
*> SOURCE clause names.
