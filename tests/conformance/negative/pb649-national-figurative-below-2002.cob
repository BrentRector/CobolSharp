      *> reject-at: 85
      *> The comparison ISO 8.8.4.2.6 governs - "Two operands, one class alphanumeric and one class
      *> national, may be compared" - cannot be written below COBOL-2002, because class national itself is
      *> a 2002 introduction. So the positive golden 2002/pb649_national_figurative_collation has its
      *> edition witness here: at COBOL-85 the national literal N"AB" inside `ALL N"AB"` draws the
      *> boolean/national-data introduction gate (COBOLNET0900, construct national-data-2002).
      *>
      *> ⚠ STATED PLAINLY: this case is the EDITION gate's witness and not the collation rule's. The
      *> collation rule's own witness is the positive golden's AN-LT line, which must still take the
      *> ALPHANUMERIC program collating sequence while its national siblings do not.
