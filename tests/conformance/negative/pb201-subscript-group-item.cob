      *> ISO 8.4.2.3.2's subscript general format is exactly three alternatives -
      *> ALL, arithmetic-expression-1, index-name-1 [{+|-} integer-1] - so a bare
      *> data-name subscript is admitted ONLY as arithmetic-expression-1, and
      *> 8.8.1.1 then admits only "an identifier referencing a NUMERIC data item,
      *> a numeric literal, the figurative constant ZERO". 8.5.2.1: "an
      *> alphanumeric group item has class and category alphanumeric". So a GROUP
      *> is not admissible in the position, at every edition (8.8.1.1 is
      *> unchanged across 85/2002/2014/2023 - no introduction axis, no gate).
      *> kb/Work PB201: the strict REJECTION must survive the carrier reroute.
      *> The fast path can no longer render a group's record-struct carrier, so
      *> this now reaches ExpressionBinder on the D18 route - and the verdict has
      *> to be the SAME one, not a backend CS1503 and not silence.
