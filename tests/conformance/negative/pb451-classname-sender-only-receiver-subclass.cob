      *> ISO §14.9.39.3 syntax rule 13 a): "if the data item referenced by identifier-3 is
      *> described with the ONLY phrase, object-class-name-1 shall be the object-class-name
      *> specified in the description of the data item referenced by identifier-3."
      *> §13.18.60.4 GR22 d)2.a. is why: with ONLY, "the object referenced by this data item

      *> d)1.a. (no ONLY) admits "or of a subclass".  The receiver here is FACTORY OF …C ONLY

      *> `SET F1 F2 TO PB451D` line of conformance:2002/pb451_set_format5_class_name_sender,
      *> which is legal and prints FTAG-D — so the ONLY axis is what decides, not the names.
