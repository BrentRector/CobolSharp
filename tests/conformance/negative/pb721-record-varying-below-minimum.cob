*> ISO 13.18.43.3 SR4, the FIRST of the rule's two obligations: "Record
*> descriptions for the file shall describe neither records that contain a LESSER
*> number of bytes than that specified by integer-2 nor records that contain a
*> greater number of bytes than that specified by integer-3." F-REC describes 5
*> bytes where the clause states integer-2 = 10. The smallest size a record
*> description describes is 13.18.43.4 GR8 a)'s - every occurs-depending table at
*> its MINIMUM occurrence count - and F-REC has no table, so it is simply 5.
*> The clause itself is well-formed here (SR5 holds: 20 is greater than 10), so
*> this program witnesses SR4's lower arm ALONE. kb/Work PB721.
