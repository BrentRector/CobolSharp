      *> ISO 14.8.2.3.3 rule 2d: a BY CONTENT argument whose formal parameter is
      *> not numeric, not an index item and not ANY LENGTH conforms by "the same
      *> [rules] as for a MOVE statement with the argument as the sending operand
      *> and the corresponding formal parameter as the receiving operand". For a
      *> boolean-expression-1 argument that is 14.9.25.3 Table 16's BOOLEAN row,
      *> whose NUMERIC and NUMERIC-EDITED columns are both "No".
      *>
      *> This is the conformance half of the PB46 boolean channel, and it is a
      *> JUDGEMENT rather than a parse failure: 14.9.23.2's BY CONTENT branch
      *> admits boolean-expression-1, so the operand is legal syntax and the
      *> pairing is what fails. Before the channel existed the same source was
      *> refused for the wrong reason entirely — the boolean operator was not
      *> consumed at all, so `B-AND` landed in a name slot (COBOLNET0901) and the
      *> statement reported "3 USING argument(s) for 1 formal parameter(s)", an
      *> arity diagnostic about a rule the program does not violate.
