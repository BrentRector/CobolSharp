      *> ISO 13.18.54.3 SR3 - "The ROUNDED phrase may be specified in the SUM
      *> clause only if the COLUMN clause is specified for the subject of the
      *> entry."  The entry below carries a SUM clause with a ROUNDED phrase and
      *> no COLUMN clause, so it defines no printable item (13.18.14).  The rule
      *> exists because 13.18.54.4 GR4 is the phrase's only general rule and it
      *> opens "If the entry also contains a COLUMN clause, the sum counter acts
      *> as a source data item" - with nothing to deliver the counter to, the
      *> phrase would have nothing to round.  13.18.54.4 GR1 still establishes
      *> the counter (an unprintable SUM entry is legal), which is why only the
      *> ROUNDED phrase is refused and not the entry.  Before kb/Work PB883 the
      *> phrase had no grammar surface, so SR3 had nothing to screen.
