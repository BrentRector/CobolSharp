*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 13.18.43.3 SR7: "Integer-2 shall be greater than or equal to zero."
*> !! THE RULE HAS TWO HALVES AND THIS IS THE REJECTING ONE. The PERMITTING half -
*> that FROM 0 is legal and shall compile - is witnessed by
*> tests/conformance/2023/pb721_zero_length_record.cob and its COBOL-85 twin; a
*> corpus that pinned only the permission would never notice a compiler that
*> accepted a negative minimum too.
*> A negative operand cannot be written at all, and that is the GENERAL FORMAT's
*> doing rather than a screen's: 5.5 rule 1 - "When the term 'integer-n' (n = 1, 2,
*> ...) is used in a general format and associated rules, it refers to a fixed-point
*> integer literal that shall be unsigned and nonzero unless otherwise specified in
*> the associated rules" - makes every integer-n UNSIGNED, so the minus sign is
*> refused where the format writes integer-2. (SR7 is precisely the "unless
*> otherwise specified" override, and it overrides the NONZERO half only.)
