      *> ISO 15.28.3 rule 1: "Argument-1 is optional and when specified shall be the name of a file connector
      *> that is specified in an FD statement." TF is SELECTed but has no FD entry at all - it is not "specified in an FD statement". (OTHER-FILE is an unrelated FD so the FILE SECTION is well-formed.) Before PB63 the resolver matched the bare name only, so
      *> this compiled clean and answered rule 2a's two spaces. The file-connector-name argument form is 2023.
