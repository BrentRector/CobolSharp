*> kb/Work PB524 - ISO 13.18.34.3 SR2: "Data-name-1, data-name-2, data-name-3, and data-name-4 shall reference
*> elementary unsigned numeric integer data items." PG-SIZE is ALPHANUMERIC, so this is not a LINAGE clause of
*> any edition. It used to compile clean and run: the logical page was built from the characters "007" read as
*> the number 7, a silent reinterpretation of illegal source (the emitter ASSUMED SR2 and nothing enforced it).
*> The same screen names the other failing conjuncts - a group, a signed, a fractional, a floating-point or an
*> index operand - each by the word of SR2 it breaks.
