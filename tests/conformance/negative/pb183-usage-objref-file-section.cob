*> ISO 13.18.60.3 SR15: "The USAGE OBJECT REFERENCE clause shall not be specified in the file
*> section." THE DIRECT DECLARATION ARM - a textbook two-arm dispatch with only the indirect arm
*> enforced: its SAME AS twin (13.18.49.3 SR6, "a SAME AS clause in the file section shall not
*> reference an item whose description contains a USAGE OBJECT REFERENCE data item") has been
*> screened as COBOLNET1556 since the SAME AS landing, while writing the clause directly on an FD
*> record was accepted. R is at level 1, so SR14 admits it and SR15 alone rejects it - which is what
*> makes this fixture attributable to its own arm.
