*> reject-at: 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 13.18.63.3 SR5: "If the item is of category national or national-edited, literals in
*> the VALUE clause shall be national literals." The subject here is category national-edited
*> (13.18.40.4 GR10), so the alphanumeric "AB CD" is refused - COBOLNET0898. The legal spelling,
*> VALUE N"AB CD", is pinned by conformance:{2002,2014,2023}/pb492_national_edited.
*> reject-at omits 85 because the DECLARATION is already a COBOL-2002 introduction there
*> (conformance:negative/pb492-national-edited-at-85, COBOLNET0900) - a different rule and code.
