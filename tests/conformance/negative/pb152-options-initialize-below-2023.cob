*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014
*> The OPTIONS INITIALIZE clause is a COBOL-2023 addition (Annex E.3.3 item 33), and the introduction
*> gate that says so must keep firing below 2023 after kb/Work PB152 gave the clause its data-division
*> consumers. The fill literal here is the CONFORMING X"5A" spelling precisely so that the only thing
*> this fixture can be rejected for is the edition gate - a fixture that also violated 11.9.10.3 SR1
*> would pass for the wrong reason if the gate ever stopped firing.
*>
*> This is the edition-gate half of the PB152 landing's obligation: the new BEHAVIOUR is a >= 2023
*> branch (below 2023 the clause cannot be written, so the no-clause space/zero seed remains the
*> conformant realization of 11.9.10.4 GR6 there), and nothing about the fill work may disturb the
*> introduction gate.
