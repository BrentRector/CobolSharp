*> ISO §13.18.34.3 SR1 — "Data-name-1, data-name-2, data-name-3, and data-name-4 shall not be subject to any
*> OCCURS clauses." T-LINES is an element of a table, so it IS subject to an OCCURS clause however it is
*> written; this fixture writes it WITHOUT a subscript so the rule is tested on the RESOLVED item rather than
*> on the written shape (its subscripted twin is pb489-linage-operand-subscripted).
*> ⛔ THE RULE HAD NO SITE AT ALL until kb/Work PB489 — a grep for a §13.18.34.3 citation over the whole tree
*> returned nothing. This source compiled clean and then died at OPEN OUTPUT with an unhandled runtime
*> "LINAGE operand 'T-LINES' is not resolvable to storage" throw, which is a process kill where §4.2.2
*> requires the implementation to indicate the violation; the message also cited SR2 for what is SR1's
*> obligation. The rule is present in all four supported editions.
