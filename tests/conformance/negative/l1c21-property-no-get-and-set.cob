      *> The { GET | SET } braces carry no choice indicators, so "one of

      *> §5.2.6.3 (Braces)) — ONE, not both; choice indicators, which
      *> would permit several, are absent (§5.2.6.4). "WITH NO GET SET"
      *> is therefore not a legal phrase. The rest of the program is
      *> valid (a factory property in a class that is never used), so
      *> the only reason to reject is the general format. The violation
      *> is pure syntax, so the diagnostic is the parser's (see .err).
