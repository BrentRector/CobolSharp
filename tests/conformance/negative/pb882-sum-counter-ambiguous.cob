      *> ISO 8.4.2.2.1 - "a statement shall contain a reference that uniquely
      *> identifies that resource".  13.18.54.4 GR1 establishes "an independent
      *> sum counter" for EACH entry containing a SUM clause, so the two CF-T
      *> entries below establish TWO counters that happen to share a name.
      *> DECLARING them that way is legal - the uniqueness requirement bites on a
      *> REFERENCE, which is exactly why tests/conformance/85/pb882_report_sum_
      *> counter_identity.cob compiles and prints two different totals from an
      *> identically shaped report description.  What is illegal is the
      *> REFERENCE: `MOVE CF-T TO WS-SEEN` names neither counter in particular,
      *> and a sum counter's only available qualifier is the report-name of
      *> 8.4.2.2.2 Format 1, which cannot separate two counters of ONE report.
