*> reject-at: 85
*> The edition floor under pb427_same_type_by_position: 8.5.3.1's same-type rule has nothing to speak
*> about below COBOL-2002, because the TYPEDEF clause that declares a type and the TYPE clause that
*> references one are both 2002 introductions (ISO 1989:2023 13.18.58 / 13.18.57; Annex F.2).  The
*> minimal shape of the positive -- one STRONG type declaration and two items described with it -- is
*> therefore COBOLNET0900 at 85 and conforming from 2002 up.
