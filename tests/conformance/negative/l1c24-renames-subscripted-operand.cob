      *> R-A(1) is a well-formed subscripted reference to a table
      *> element of record R. SR7 forbids the subscript as such; the
      *> RENAMES operand position admits only a (qualified) data-name.
      *> Every well-formed subscripted reference names an item subject
      *> to an OCCURS clause, so SR3's OCCURS prohibition necessarily
      *> co-applies — SR7 cannot be isolated from SR3 by any source.
      *> The .err pins the subscript diagnostic (the operand is not a
      *> data-name because it carries a subscript), not an OCCURS one.
