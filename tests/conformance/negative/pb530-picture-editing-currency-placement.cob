      *> kb/Work PB530 - ISO 1989:2023 13.18.40.3 SR26, SECOND sentence: "For extended editing sign control,
      *> the currency symbol when used shall be either the leftmost symbol in character-string-1, optionally
      *> preceded by character-1, or the rightmost symbol in character-string-1 optionally followed by

      *> a declared EDITING character-1 is TRANSPARENT to the walk (kb/Work PB528), which is exactly what
      *> makes the two LEGAL spellings legal (positive golden 2023/pb530_picture_editing_order_2023 entries

      *> not RESCUE a currency symbol that is neither leftmost nor rightmost. COBOLNET1935, 2023 only (the
