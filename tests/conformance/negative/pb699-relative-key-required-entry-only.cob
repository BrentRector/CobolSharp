*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.2 SR10 - "The RELATIVE clause shall be specified if the DYNAMIC or RANDOM
*> phrase of the ACCESS clause is specified." THE CITATION IS THE POINT: this rejection used to cite
*> "12.4.5.13 - required for random/dynamic access", and 12.4.5.13 has no syntax rules at all (they
*> are in 12.4.5.13.3, and none of the three requires the clause); the 12.4.5.1 Format 2 diagram
*> BRACKETS the RELATIVE KEY clause, so the format does not require it either. SR10 is the one
*> sentence that does. Entry-only: no verb names the file (kb/Work PB699).
