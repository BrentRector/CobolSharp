*> category alphanumeric or category national within a record description entry associated with the
*> file-name specified in this file control entry." data-name-1 here is a WORKING-STORAGE item, so
*> the record has no key positions at all. Before kb/Work PB699 this compiled clean and the alternate
*> access path bound to storage outside the record area. (The screen implements the WITHIN-A-RECORD
*> half of SR2 for data-name-1; the category half and data-name-2 are recorded PARTIAL.)
