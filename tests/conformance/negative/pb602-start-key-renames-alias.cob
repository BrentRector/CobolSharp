      *> kb/Work PB602 - ISO 14.9.41.3 SR5's identity again, through the OTHER reference form that shares one
      *> item's storage while being another item: a non-THROUGH level-66 alias. ISO 13.18.45.4 GR1 - "When the
      *> THROUGH phrase is not specified, all of the data attributes of data-name-2 become the data attributes of
      *> data-name-1 and the storage area occupied by data-name-2 becomes the storage area occupied by
      *> data-name-1" - shares the attributes and the storage, NOT the name: RK-ALIAS is a data item of its own,
      *> and it is not the item the RELATIVE KEY clause specifies.
      *> The THROUGH form was already refused here, because it composes a place of its own; the non-THROUGH form
      *> forwarded to the renamed item's place outright and became indistinguishable from writing WS-RK. Two
      *> spellings of one rule, one arm implemented (feedback_two_arm_dispatch).
      *> The positive control - where the same alias is a legal MOVE and ADD receiver - is
