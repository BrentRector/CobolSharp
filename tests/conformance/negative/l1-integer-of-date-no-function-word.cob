      *> paragraph … the word FUNCTION may be omitted from the function-identifier;

      *> diagnostic instead — a different rule about a different clause, which a
      *> negative pinning THIS one must not silently absorb.
      *> The accepting side of the word (written) is 2023/l1_integer_date_form_
