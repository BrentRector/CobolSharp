*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.2 SR8 sentence 1, reached through 12.4.5.10.3 GR6 - "When the ORGANIZATION
*> clause is not specified, sequential organization with the RECORD SEQUENTIAL phrase is implied."
*> ⛔ THIS IS THE SHAPE THAT MATTERS. It is not a contrived spelling: an entry written without an
*> ORGANIZATION clause at all is record sequential by GR6, so a RECORD KEY clause on it specifies
*> Format 1 for a file that is not indexed. The diagnostic must NAME the omission - a message that
*> only said "this file is sequential" would name something the source does not contain (PB742).
