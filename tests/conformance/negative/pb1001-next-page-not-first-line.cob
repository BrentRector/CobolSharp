*> A NEXT PAGE PHRASE ON A LATER LINE CLAUSE OF THE GROUP (kb/Work PB1001). ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §13.18.35.3
*> SR7: "Within a given report group description, a NEXT PAGE phrase, if present, shall be specified only in
*> the first LINE clause." The phrase acts before any line is printed (§13.18.35.4 GR4a: the page fit is
*> declared unsuccessful), so on a second line it would split the group across two pages, which GR2 forbids.
*> A rule of every edition: `LINE integer-1 ON NEXT PAGE` is COBOL-85 syntax.
