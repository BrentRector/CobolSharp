*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.6.3 SR2, the CATEGORY arm - "Data-name-1 and data-name-2 shall be defined as
*> a data item of category alphanumeric or national within a record description entry associated with
*> the file-name to which the ALTERNATE RECORD KEY clause is subordinate."
*> The ALTERNATE twin, and it must ship WITH the prime one: the compiler already wrote a category
*> screen for the RELATIVE key (12.4.5.13.3 SR2, an unsigned integer) and for neither record key -
*> one member of a rule set written down is exactly where the missing members hide (kb/Work PB743).
*> The prime key here is legal, so the only rejection is the alternate clause's.
