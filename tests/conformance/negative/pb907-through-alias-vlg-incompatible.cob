      *> kb/Work PB907 - THE ALIAS SENDER GETS 8.5.1.12's COMPATIBILITY ANSWER, NOT A FALSE KIND CLAIM.
      *> 13.18.45.4 GR2 makes SALIAS "an alphanumeric group item", so 14.9.25.3 SR9 asks whether it and
      *> the variable-length group DST are compatible. They are not: D1 is a dynamic-capacity table at
      *> relative byte position 0 and SALIAS has no table there (8.5.1.12.1 rule 1, "For each
      *> dynamic-capacity table in either group there is a corresponding table in the other group", with
      *> 8.5.1.12.2's positional correspondence). The expected diagnostic is that reason - the one the
      *> structural twin (a plain group with SALIAS's layout) draws - and never "the sending operand is
      *> not a group item", which is what this program used to be told.
