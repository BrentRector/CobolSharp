      *> positive side is pinned by pb19 (FUNCTION LOG10(1000)) and
      *> pb56 (FUNCTION LOG10(100)); nothing exercised the rejection,
      *> which is the whole content of a "shall" clause.

      *> TWO OPERANDS, ONE RULE, BOTH DECIDABLE AT BIND TIME.
      *> (1) PIC X(3) is class ALPHANUMERIC (ISO 8.5.2.1 Table 2).
      *> (2) PIC ZZ9.99 is category NUMERIC-EDITED, which Table 2 puts
      *> under class ALPHANUMERIC when its usage is display - the
      *> rule says CLASS, so however numeric the item looks it is not
      *> a legal argument-1. A screen written on CATEGORY rather than
      *> CLASS passes the first line and fails only on the second.
      *>
      *> Note this rule is 15.56.3, LOG10's own - NOT 15.55.3, which
      *> is LOG's and carries word-for-word identical text. The two
      *> clauses are separate inventory rows and each is cited from
      *> its own function's clause, never inherited from its twin.
      *>
      *> Edition-invariant: LOG10 is a COBOL-85 Intrinsic Function
      *> Module member and 15.56.3 r1 has no edition-conditional
      *> wording, so the rejection is owed at every edition.
