      *> ISO 13.18.53.3 SR7 - "If the SOURCE clause has more than one operand of
      *> which at least one is an arithmetic-expression, each operand shall be
      *> enclosed in parentheses."  This clause writes TWO operands, the first an
      *> arithmetic-expression, and neither is parenthesized.  The rule is what
      *> makes an operand LIST readable at all: operands are separated by nothing
      *> but a space (13.18.53.2's ellipsis repeats the brace pair), so
      *> `SOURCES ARE WS-A + WS-B WS-B` has two readings - one operand or two -
      *> and the standard removes the choice by requiring `(WS-A + WS-B) (WS-B)`.
      *> The rule is ENFORCED (COBOLNET2142) rather than inferred from the
      *> grammar's greedy shape, which would silently pick one reading.
      *> 2002 and above only: SR7 bites on a MULTI-operand clause, which SR6
      *> confines to a repeating entry, and 13.15.4 GR3's repetition vehicles
      *> (multiple COLUMN / LINE, report-group OCCURS) are 2002 introductions -
      *> at 85 the clause is refused for that reason instead (COBOLNET0900).
