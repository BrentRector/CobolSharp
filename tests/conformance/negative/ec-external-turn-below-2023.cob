*> VCR 15 introduction half (Annex E.3 item 9): the EC-EXTERNAL exception-condition
*> family is new in COBOL-2023 (ExceptionCatalog introducedIn 2023) — enabling it via
*> >>TURN at 2002/2014 is COBOLNET0878, never a silent no-op. (At --std 85 the >>TURN

*> COBOLNET0900 — a different code, so 85 is pinned by the turn-directive-2002 registry
