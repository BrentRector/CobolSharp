*> ISO 1989:2023 12.4.5.12.3 SR2's category arm over the OTHER excluded neighbour of category
*> alphanumeric. PIC A is category ALPHABETIC (8.5.2.3), a category of its own; 8.8.4.2.4's "A class
*> alphabetic operand shall be treated as though it were an operand of class alphanumeric" is a
*> COMPARISON rule and not a category identity, so an alphabetic key is not "of category
*> alphanumeric" and SR2 refuses it. This case exists because the storage model folds PIC A into
*> PicCategory.Alphanumeric: without it, a screen written as a bare category comparison would pass
*> and nothing would say so (kb/Work PB743; the model carries PicInfo.IsAlphabetic for exactly this).
