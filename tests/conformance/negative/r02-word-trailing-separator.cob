      *> This was ACCEPTED before fix-queue R02, and the hyphen half predates the
      *> underscore work entirely: "nor last" was enforced only in the ALPHA-start
      *> lexer alternative, while the two DIGIT-start alternatives ended in a `*`
      *> over the separator class. Adding the underscore to that class without
      *> closing the hole would have inherited it for the new character too, so
      *> the tail was factored into NAME_TAIL - which cannot end on a separator -
      *> and all three alternatives now share it.
