      *> ISO 15.3: "When the definition of a function permits an argument to be repeated a variable number of
      *> times, a table may be referenced by specifying the data-name and any qualifiers that identify the table,
      *> followed immediately by subscripting where one or more of the subscripts is the word ALL." MOD's format (15.64.2) is `( argument-1 argument-2 )` - fixed at two, no repetition.
      *> Before PB62 the ALL was expanded at bind time for EVERY function, so this bound (and evaluated) over a

      *> expansion - "takes N argument(s); M given" about arguments the user never wrote. Diagnosed as the
      *> inadmissible ALL it is, at ANY cardinality.
