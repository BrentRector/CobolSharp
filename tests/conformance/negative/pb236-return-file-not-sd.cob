*> kb/Work PB236 - ISO 14.9.34.3 SR1: "File-name-1 shall be described by a sort-merge file description entry
*> in the data division." F-IN has an FD. Also behind a GO TO, for the reason the RELEASE twin gives.
*> This site used to conflate TWO verdicts in one test: `!FilesByName.TryGetValue(...) || !file.IsSortMerge`
*> answered "there is no such file-name" (8.4.2.1) and "the file exists but is under an FD" (14.9.34.3 SR1)
*> with the same message. They are different diagnoses; the undeclared case is now COBOLNET1639.
