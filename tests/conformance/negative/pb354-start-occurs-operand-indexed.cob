*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.41.3 SR4 - "Data-name-1 or record-key-name-1 shall not be subject to any OCCURS
*> clauses." The indexed arm used to reject this only as a SIDE EFFECT of the offset walk bailing out
*> on an OCCURS ancestor, and it reported SR6's message - a sentence that is FALSE of IX-ELEM (1),
*> which DOES begin at the record key's leftmost character position and IS shorter than it. SR4 now
*> has its own named check ahead of the position walk, so the reported reason is the real one.
