      *> phrase of the USAGE Clause is specified for the subject of the entry", restated by 13.18.60.4 GR11
      *> ("The PICTURE character string of the data item shall not contain the symbol 'S'").
      *> The phrase here is written at the GROUP level, and 13.18.60.4 GR1 applies that clause "only to each
