      *> reject-at: 2023
      *> ISO §14.9.28.3 SR14 — one phrase against ITSELF. The counting
      *> domain the rule states is "in any of the WHEN phrases within
      *> the scope of a format 3 PERFORM statement", which is the
      *> statement's phrases taken together; two occurrences inside a
      *> single WHEN EXCEPTION file-name list are therefore still "more
      *> than once", and neither is paired with an exception-name, so
      *> the licensing clause does not apply.
      *> This case is what separates a per-STATEMENT census from a
      *> per-PHRASE one — a check that compared phrases pairwise would
      *> accept it.
      *> ONLY 2023 is named: the exception-checking PERFORM is new in
      *> COBOL-2023 (Annex E.3.3 item 36).
