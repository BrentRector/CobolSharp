*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014
*> The BYTES spelling of the RECORD clause's { BYTES | CHARACTERS } brace group is a COBOL-2023
*> ADDITION, and below 2023 it is refused by name (COBOLNET0900, the introduction band).
*> THE EDITION FACT IS DERIVED, NOT ASSUMED. Annex E.3.3 item 13 lists BYTES among the words that
*> "have either been added to the list of context-sensitive words or the context in which they
*> are reserved has been expanded" - an OR - and 8.10 gives BYTES exactly ONE construct, the
*> "RECORD clause", so there is no earlier context for 2023 to have EXPANDED and the first arm is
*> the one that applies: the spelling did not exist below 2023. SECONDS sits in the same item-13
*> list and CONTINUE AFTER ... SECONDS is gated the same way.
*> The CHARACTERS spelling of the very same clause is 1985-continuous and draws nothing, which is
*> what tests/conformance/85/pb721_zero_length_record_85.cob compiles; and the WORD stays a
*> user-defined word at every edition, which tests/conformance/85/pb721_bytes_user_word_85.cob
*> compiles. Together those three programs say exactly what is gated and what is not.
