*> ISO 1989:2023 14.8.2.3.3 rule 2d: "Otherwise, the conformance rules are the same as for a MOVE statement with
*> the argument as the sending operand and the corresponding formal parameter as the receiving operand." The
*> WHOLE MOVE question - including 14.9.25.3 SR8: "If identifier-1 references a data item described with usage
*> binary-char, binary-short, binary-long, or binary-double, identifier-2 shall reference a numeric or
*> numeric-edited item." A BINARY-LONG argument BY CONTENT to a PIC X(4) formal is therefore non-conforming.
*> kb/Work PB878: the INVOKE screen asked Table 16 alone (a hand list that admitted every integer numeric
*> sender), so this compiled clean and the method printed LK-X=[0000]. Refused with COBOLNET0828.
