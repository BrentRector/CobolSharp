      *> ISO §14.9.34.2 — the AT END phrase OMITTED ENTIRELY. The general format prints
      *>     AT END imperative-statement-1
      *> on its own line with NO brackets, between the bracketed [ NOT AT END … ] and [ END-RETURN ]; per
      *> §5.2.6.2 brackets are the only convention that makes a portion of a general format omissible and per
      *> §5.2.2 an underlined keyword is required subject to those conventions, so the phrase is MANDATORY.
      *> Nothing in the rule is edition-dependent — it is a property of the printed format, not of a feature
      *> introduction — hence all four reject-at years.
      *> Until kb/Work PB350 this compiled clean at every edition and produced a WRONG ANSWER: §14.9.34.4 GR3
      *> makes imperative-statement-1 the only defined destination for control at end of data, so with no AT
      *> END phrase control fell THROUGH the statement onto a record area the same rule leaves undefined, and
      *> a loop written on RETURN could never terminate from the statement — this program printed the
      *> previous record again instead.
