*> reject-at: 85
*> kb/Work PB405 — the EDITION EDGE of the structured-exit statement this fix is about. EXIT PARAGRAPH is the
*> COBOL-2002 introduction of ISO 14.9.14.2 Format 4 (14.9.14.4 GR6); COBOL-85's EXIT statement has only the
*> bare Format-1 "assign a procedure-name to a given point in a procedure division" form, so at --std 85 the
*> construct row refuses it COBOLNET0900. It compiles at 2002 and above, where the positive witness
*> tests/conformance/2002/pb405_exit_paragraph_section_in_inline_perform.cob measures GR6 and GR7 inside an
*> inline PERFORM — the placement that used to emit a bare C# `break` and leave the PERFORM's loop instead of
*> the paragraph.
