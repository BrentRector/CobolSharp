*> reject-at: 2023
*> ISO 8.5.1.12.2, POSITIONAL CORRESPONDENCE - the NEGATIVE side of kb/Work PB204. 14.8.2.2 admits a
*> variable-length group across a Format-2 CALL only when the two sides are COMPATIBLE "as described in
*> 8.5.1.12", and 8.5.1.12.1 rule 3 requires that "for each dynamic-length elementary item in either group
*> there is a corresponding dynamic-length elementary item in the other group", correspondence being
*> "start at the same relative byte positions within their groups" (8.5.1.12.2).
*> VD starts at relative byte position 3 and LD at 4, so the groups are NOT compatible and the CALL is
*> rejected. The WITNESS matters: with the compatibility relation absent, EVERY such CALL was rejected and
*> a fixture could not tell an implemented rule from a blanket refusal.
