      *> ISO 14.9.49.2 Format 1 prints `{ EXCEPTION | ERROR }` inside BRACES, both words UNDERLINED.
      *> 5.2.6.3: braces mean "one of the options contained within the braces shall be selected";
      *> 5.2.2 makes each underlined word required. PB332 made AFTER, STANDARD, PROCEDURE and ON
      *> omittable because none of them is underlined - it did NOT make the braced choice optional,
      *> and a Format 1 USE that names neither EXCEPTION nor ERROR selects no format at all.
      *> 4.2.2 requires a mechanism "to indicate violations of the general formats and the explicit
      *> syntax rules of standard COBOL"; strict mode is where this compiler provides it.
