*> THE OTHER ARM, and it exists because Annex A.3 item 40 names both clauses in ONE sentence: "The
*> capability of specifying the SOURCE phrase of the RECORD KEY clause and ALTERNATE RECORD KEY clause is
*> dependent on the capabilities of the processor." A fix reaching only the prime key would be this
*> repository's most reproducible defect shape - one dispatch, two arms, one of them fixed - on a clause
*> that literally IS the other arm. The original finding named only the prime key; kb/Work PB293 caught it.
*> 12.4.5.6.2's general format (RENDERED from printed page 350, folio 320) prints the SAME brace group as
*> 12.4.5.12.2's: ALTERNATE, RECORD and SOURCE carry underline rules; KEY and both occurrences of IS do
*> not. 12.4.5.6.4 GR2 gives the repetition its meaning - "Record-key-name-1 defines a record key
*> consisting of the concatenation of all occurrences of data-name-2 in the order specified."
*> The PRIME key here is the ordinary, supported data-name-1 form and is deliberately legal: the only thing
*> this entry can be refused for is the alternate clause's SOURCE phrase, so a decline that fired on the
*> supported form instead would show up as the wrong clause being named rather than as a silent pass.
*> Before 2026-09-09 this spelling drew TWO generic COBOL0312 errors - one at SOURCE and one at the WITH of
*> a DUPLICATES phrase the parser had already lost its place before reaching. kb/Work PB358.
