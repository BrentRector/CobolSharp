*> reject-at: 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.32.3 syntax rule 4: "Literal-1 shall not be a zero-length literal."  It is
*> RELEASE's rule ALONE: the FROM phrases of WRITE (14.9.51.3) and REWRITE (14.9.35.3) state no such
*> sentence, so kb/Work PB348 carries it on the RELEASE row of the per-verb rules table rather than
*> applying it to every FROM phrase.
*> 85 is not listed because the FROM phrase admits only identifier-1 at X3.23-1985, so a literal
*> sender there is refused by the edition gate COBOLNET0871 before SR4 is reached -- a different
*> rule, and a .err file names ONE diagnostic for every edition it lists.
*> This was a missing APPLICATION, not a missing capability: the compiler already owns the
*> zero-length-literal predicate and applies it in ControlFlowBinder, IntrinsicBinder,
*> DataBinder.Switches and CallBinder.
