      *> kb/Work PB896 - THE COMPLEMENT OF tests/conformance/85/pb896_zero_length_group_sender.cob, and the
      *> reason that golden covers ISO 8.5.4 item 1 rather than items 5 and 7.
      *> 8.5.4's four GROUP shapes are all zero-length items, but only item 1 - "A group data item containing
      *> only an occurs-depending table in which the number of occurrences is zero" - can reach an ELEMENTARY
      *> receiving operand. Items 5 and 7 are VARIABLE-LENGTH groups, and ISO 14.9.25.3 SR9 requires the two
      *> operands of such a move to be compatible groups as specified in 8.5.1.12, so a variable-length group
      *> sender with an elementary receiver is refused at compile time and 14.9.25.4 GR1's run-time substitution
      *> is never reached. That is a rule, not a gap: this case is what makes it a MEASURED one.
      *> reject-at names 2014 and 2023 only because OCCURS DYNAMIC (ISO 13.18.38 Format 4) is a COBOL-2014
      *> introduction - below it the entry itself is refused by the edition gate, a different diagnostic.
