      *> ISO §13.18.53.3 SR6 — the SOURCE clause's twin of §13.18.63.3 SR35, written for the other clause: "If
      *> the SOURCE clause has more than one operand, the entry shall be a repeating entry or shall be
      *> subordinate to a repeating entry, and the number of operands of the SOURCE clause shall be equal to the
      *> number of repetitions of the repeating entry or the same number multiplied by the number of repetitions
      *> of any number of successive repeating entries at higher levels than the repeating entry."  The entry
      *> below is a repeating entry with TWO repetitions (§13.15.4 GR3 — a COLUMN clause with two operands) and
      *> writes THREE SOURCE operands, which is neither two nor two times anything.
      *> ⛔ THIS IS THE ARM THAT WAS NEVER THERE (kb/Work PB506).  Before it, `reportSourceClause` was
      *> `SOURCE IS? dataReference` — ONE operand, no SOURCES spelling — so a conforming multi-operand SOURCE
      *> clause was a raw parse error and SR6 had nothing at all to screen.  The two rules are now screened by
      *> ONE reader, with a diagnostic per clause so the reader is sent to the subclause actually written.
      *> SR6 carries no version proviso, so it is reported at all four editions; at 85 the two COBOLNET0900
      *> introduction gates this program trips - the multiple COLUMN clause and the multi-operand SOURCE /
      *> SOURCES spelling - are reported ALONGSIDE it, not instead of it.
