      *> reject-at: 85 2002
      *> ISO 14.7.4 - the ROUNDED phrase's `MODE IS rounding-mode` half, and its
      *> eight rounding modes, are a COBOL-2014 introduction; a bare ROUNDED at
      *> 85/2002 means the single nearest-away-from-zero rounding.  The report
      *> SOURCE clause's rounded-phrase IS that phrase - 13.18.53.2 says so
      *> verbatim ("where rounded-phrase is described in 14.7.4, ROUNDED
      *> phrase") - so it inherits the gate with no second rule written down:
      *> the grammar references the ONE roundedPhrase production and
      *> VersionConformancePass ParseArm.VisitRoundedPhrase fires on RECOGNITION
      *> wherever it appears (COBOLNET0803).  That is the whole point of sharing
      *> the production rather than writing a report-local copy: a report clause
      *> could not otherwise have acquired the 2014 gate at all.  The same file
      *> compiles at 2014 and 2023.
