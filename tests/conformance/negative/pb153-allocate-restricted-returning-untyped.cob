      *> "If data-name-2 references a restricted data-pointer,
      *> data-name-1 shall be specified and shall reference a typed
      *> data item, and the data item referenced by data-name-2 shall
      *> be restricted to the type of data-name-1." Here the RETURNING
      *> pointer is restricted to TPT but the based item is untyped,
      *> so the restriction can never be satisfied. A fixture for SR5
      *> alone would leave this direction unproven.
