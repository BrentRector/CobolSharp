*> reject-at: 2023
*> kb/Work PB305 - THE OTHER HALF OF THE PROJECTION, so the fix cannot become a blanket acceptance.
*> 8.5.2.1 Table 2 puts category numeric-edited (usage display) in class ALPHANUMERIC, which is what makes
*> FUNCTION FIND-STRING(<PIC ZZ9 item> "5") legal. It does NOT make it class national, and 15.37.3 r2 is
*> two-armed: "If argument-1 is of class alphabetic or alphanumeric, argument-2 shall be a data item or
*> literal of either class alphabetic or alphanumeric. If argument-1 is of class national, argument-2 shall
*> be of class national." A numeric-edited argument-1 lands in the FIRST arm, so a national argument-2 is
*> refused - exactly as a PIC X(3) argument-1 would refuse it.
*> WHY IT IS HERE: the defect PB305 fixed was a screen that SPLIT class alphanumeric in two. The repair is a
*> Table-2 class PROJECTION, and the failure mode of a projection is over-merging - collapsing national into
*> alphanumeric as well and admitting everything. This case is the witness that it did not.
