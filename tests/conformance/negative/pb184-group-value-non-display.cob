      *> an alphanumeric group item shall be explicitly or implicitly described with usage DISPLAY."  GV carries
      *> no GROUP-USAGE clause, is not strongly typed and is not a variable-length group, so it IS an
      *> alphanumeric group item - 13.18.29.4 GR3: "If a GROUP-USAGE clause is not specified or implied for a
      *> group item that is not strongly typed and is not a variable-length group, that group item is an
      *> alphanumeric group item"; 8.5.2.1 - "an alphanumeric group item has class and category alphanumeric".
      *> GB is COMPUTATIONAL.  (All THREE of GR3's conjuncts matter: the two the first landing dropped are

      *> conforming, so there is no area for the distribution to exist over.  GR5 is implemented, and correct,
      *> for the entire population SR14 admits - where every subordinate is usage DISPLAY, so the character
