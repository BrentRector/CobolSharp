*> reject-at: 85
*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.41 - START FIRST/LAST is a COBOL-2002 introduction, and the gate fires on the
*> BOUND NODE's Mode. Before kb/Work PB352 the sequential-organization arm returned BoundUnsupported
*> BEFORE any BoundKeyedStart existed, so this program compiled at --std 85 with no edition
*> diagnostic at all: the construct reached no gate because it reached no bound node. It now binds
*> like its relative and indexed twins and the introduction gate sees it.
