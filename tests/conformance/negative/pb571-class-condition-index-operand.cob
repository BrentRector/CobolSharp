      *> It was a WRONG ANSWER, not a missing refusal (kb/Work PB571). An index data item's storage profile
      *> carries category NUMERIC because the occurrence number IS a number, and the operand screen returned
      *> early unless the operand's category was boolean, so SR1 was never asked of anything: this program
      *> compiled clean and PRINTED "IX IS NUMERIC" - the precise contradiction of 13.18.60.4 GR10, "The
