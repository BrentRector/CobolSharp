*> reject-at: 85
*> ISO 1989:2023 13.18.60 / 8.5.2.6 - USAGE POINTER is a COBOL-2002 introduction, so the LINKAGE formal
*> whose carrier kb/Work PB663 added (the class-pointer managed slot, CobolArgAdapt.Slot) does not exist
*> below 2002 at all: the version-conformance pass rejects the data description entry itself with
*> COBOLNET0900 (registry row usage-pointer-2002). The BELOW-EDITION half of the pair whose positive is
*> tests/conformance/2002/pb663_linkage_managed_formal_carrier.cob - the carrier landing must not have
*> made a 2002 construct reachable at 85.
*> The FORMAT-1 half of the same rule (14.9.4.3 SR10 - a Format 1 CALL shall pass no class-pointer item
*> BY REFERENCE, which is why the callee arm is reachable only through a Format 2 activation) is already
*> pinned by pb132-call-byref-pointer; it is deliberately NOT duplicated here.
