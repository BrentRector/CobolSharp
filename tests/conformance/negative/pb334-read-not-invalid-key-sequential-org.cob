      *> kb/Work PB334 — the INVALID KEY bracket belongs to READ FORMAT 2 (14.9.30.2). On a file with
      *> SEQUENTIAL organization every READ is a FORMAT 1 read: 12.4.5.5.2 SR2 bars ACCESS RANDOM and
      *> DYNAMIC there, 14.9.30.3 SR8 then implies the NEXT phrase, and 14.9.30.4 GR19 makes an implied
      *> NEXT a sequential read. So the phrase is not conforming source, and the sequential arm neither
      *> reported it nor bound it: the block below was COMPILED AWAY -- the READ succeeded and neither
      *> imperative ran, although 14.9.30.4 GR13 c) transfers control to the NOT INVALID KEY imperative
      *> on a successful read. Under --permissive the phrase is a WARNING and the block does run.
