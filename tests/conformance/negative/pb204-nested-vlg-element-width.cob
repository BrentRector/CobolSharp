*> ISO 8.5.1.12.3, MATCHING - the second half of the compatibility relation (kb/Work PB204). Corresponding
*> tables "match when the byte length of their elements is equal and their elements are compatible". Both
*> dynamic-capacity tables here occupy relative byte position 2, so 8.5.1.12.2 makes them CORRESPOND; their
*> elements are 3 and 4 bytes, so they do not MATCH, and 8.5.1.12.1 rule 2 fails. 14.8.2.2 therefore refuses
*> the crossing. (Element byte length is exactly what the receiving side divides by to recover the capacity,
*> so an unequal pair is not a technicality - it is the fact that makes the crossing recoverable.)
