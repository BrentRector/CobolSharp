      *> reject-at: 2023
      *> kb/Work PB431 — ISO §14.9.28.2 Format 3 (exception-checking PERFORM) prints NO loop-control phrase:
      *> its head is [ WITH LOCATION ] and nothing else, followed by imperative-statement-1 and the WHEN
      *> phrases (rendered from the printed page 682 / PDF 712). Formats 2 and 3 share one grammar
      *> alternative here, so a times-phrase can be written before the WHEN — and the Format-3 binder never
      *> asked for a control phrase, so EVERY one written was dropped and the body ran exactly ONCE.
      *> reject-at names 2023 alone because Format 3 itself is COBOL-2023: below it the WHEN phrase is
      *> refused first by the introduction gate (COBOLNET0900), which is a different diagnostic.
