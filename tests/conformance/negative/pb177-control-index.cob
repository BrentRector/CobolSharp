      *> ISO 13.18.60.3 SR10: "An index data item may be referenced explicitly only in a SEARCH or SET
      *> statement, a relation condition, an intrinsic function argument, an inline method invocation argument,
      *> the USING phrase of a procedure division header, or the USING phrase of a CALL or INVOKE statement."
      *> A CONTROL clause naming the item IS an explicit reference: 8.4.5 says "a specification in the
      *> environment or data division may specify the name of a data item as an explicit reference in order to
      *> identify those data items that are to be referenced implicitly in procedure division statements
      *> related to such specifications." The CONTROL clause is not on SR10's list, so this is illegal source.
      *> Until kb/Work PB177 arm C's follow-up it compiled clean and staged a RUNTIME loud - the mis-tier a
      *> SYNTAX rule never permits. (The FLOAT operand of that same runtime guard is NOT this case: no syntax
      *> rule bars it, and it stays loud because the prior-control RESTORE half has no float channel.)
