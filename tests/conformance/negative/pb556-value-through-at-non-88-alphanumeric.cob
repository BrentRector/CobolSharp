*> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
*> ISO 1989:2023 13.18.63.3 SR33 - the SILENT twin of pb556-value-through-at-non-88, and the reason that one
*> is not enough: the same rule, the same screen, but an ALPHANUMERIC subject, where the glued text is a legal
*> C# string and nothing downstream objects.
*> MEASURED BEFORE the screen, at --std 2023 on this tree: the program compiled CLEAN and X held the three
*> characters `"A` - a quote, an A and a quote, i.e. the source text of `"A" THRU "C"` truncated to the
*> picture width. (The adjudication measured the same at 85, 2002 and 2014; the binder path carries no version
*> predicate either, which is why the rejection band below is all four editions.) A test that only pinned the
*> crashing numeric twin would have left this one passing.
