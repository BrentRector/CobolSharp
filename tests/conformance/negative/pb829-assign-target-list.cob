      *> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
      *> kb/Work PB829 (finisher) - ISO 12.4.5.1 prints `ASSIGN [TO] {device-name-1 | literal-1} ...`, so
      *> a TO phrase with two literals is inside the general format and must PARSE; ISO 12.4.5.2 SR5
      *> ("The meaning and rules for the allowable specification of device-name-1 and the value of
      *> literal-1 are defined by the implementor") is what refuses it.  COBOL.NET's determination
      *> (docs/CONFORMANCE.md section 7, DOC-A.1-71) allows one operand naming the file, or a device
      *> class (DISK or PRINTER) followed by one operand naming the file - two file names are neither,
      *> so this is COBOLNET2256 BY NAME.  It used to be COBOL0308, a parse error at the second literal.
      *> Rejected at every edition: the list and SR5's latitude are the same in all four.
