*> ISO 1989:2023 §12.4.5.2 syntax rule 7, first half: "Data-name-1 shall reference an alphanumeric data item
*> and shall not be subordinate to the file description entry for file-name-1." §9.1.21 states the same
*> requirement in the concepts - "The USING phrase references an alphanumeric data item whose content at the
*> time an OPEN, SORT, or MERGE statement for that file is executed uniquely identifies the specific physical
*> file to be accessed". WS-NUM is a category-NUMERIC item, so it cannot be data-name-1: COBOLNET1810 at every
*> edition, since the rule is the ASSIGN clause's own and no edition relaxes it (kb/Work PB324).
