*> ISO 1989:2023 14.9.27.3 SR2 - "The EXTEND phrase shall be specified only if the access mode of the
*> file connector referenced by file-name-1 is sequential and the LINAGE clause is not specified in
*> the file description entry for file-name-1." One sentence, two conjuncts: FR (ACCESS MODE IS
*> RANDOM) violates the first and FL (a LINAGE clause) the second. Both compiled clean until
*> kb/Work PB318; the EXTEND on the LINAGE file ran against an unmodelled page state.
