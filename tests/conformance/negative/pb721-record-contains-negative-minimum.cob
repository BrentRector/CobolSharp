*> ISO 13.18.43.3 SR8: "Integer-4 shall be greater than or equal to zero" - SR7's
*> twin over the Format 3 clause, and the same two halves. The permitting half is
*> the zero-length-record goldens; this is the rejecting one.
*> Same mechanism, same citation: 5.5 rule 1 makes integer-4 an unsigned literal, so
*> RECORD CONTAINS -1 TO 20 is refused where the format writes it. The pair exists
*> because a screen written for Format 2 alone is the shape that ships one arm of a
*> two-format rule (the repository's most reproducible defect). kb/Work PB721.
