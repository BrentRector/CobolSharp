      *> A PRINTABLE ENTRY WITH A COLUMN CLAUSE AND NO OPERAND (kb/Work PB853), the PICTURE-BEARING shape.
      *> ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §13.15.3 SR10: "Every elementary entry with a COLUMN clause shall also contain
      *> either a SOURCE, VALUE or SUM clause." The rule had no site, and the binder FABRICATED the missing
      *> operand — a figurative SPACE sender — so this entry printed 000 (and once aborted the run unit).
      *> Its PICTURE-less twin is pb853-report-column-no-operand-no-picture; both must draw the SR10
      *> diagnostic, not the SR12 PICTURE one.
