      *> ISO 14.9.20.4 GR3's SECOND sentence ("If an implicit INITIALIZE statement results in the execution of
      *> a declarative procedure that executes a RESUME statement with the NEXT STATEMENT phrase, processing
      *> resumes at the next implicit INITIALIZE statement, if any") can only be reached through the
      *> exception-condition mechanism: >>TURN (7.3.25), USE AFTER EXCEPTION CONDITION (14.9.49 Format 3) and
      *> the RESUME statement (14.9.33).  All three are ISO/IEC 1989:2002 introductions, so at COBOL-85 this
      *> source does not describe a program at all and the compiler must say so rather than silently ignoring
      *> the directive and running the INITIALIZE unchecked.  The FIRST sentence of GR3 (several identifier-1
      *> behave as separate INITIALIZE statements in source order) IS 85 text and keeps working there - it is
      *> the RESUMPTION POINT, and only that, which has no COBOL-85 arm.
