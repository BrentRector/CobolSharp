*> reject-at: 85
*> The edition floor under the §14.9.14.3 SR8 placement rule (kb/Work PB403). EXIT PERFORM is a COBOL-2002
*> introduction (Annex E; ConstructRegistry row exit-perform-2002), so BELOW 2002 the statement is refused by
*> the introduction gate COBOLNET0900 before any placement question can be asked -- which is why the SR8
*> placement fixture (pb403-exit-perform-outside-perform) names 2002 2014 2023 and not 85.
*>
*> The statement here is written in an ADMITTED position (inside an inline PERFORM), so the only thing that can
*> reject this program at 85 is the edition gate: a gate regression that let 2002 syntax through at 85 would
*> show up here as a clean compile, and a placement regression could not.
