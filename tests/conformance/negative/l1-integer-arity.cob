      *> reject-at: 85 2002 2014 2023
      *> ISO §15.44.2 — the general format is `FUNCTION INTEGER ( argument-1 )`: two underlined words and ONE
      *> parenthesized argument, with no optional element and no repetition. §15.3 makes that format the
      *> authority on the count — "The definition of a function specifies the number of arguments required,
      *> which may be zero, one, or more" — so the two-argument list below is not a reference to this
      *> function, and §15.44 offers no second format it could be.
      *>
      *> Written at EVERY edition the row spans: §15.44's format is unchanged across 85 / 2002 / 2014 / 2023,
      *> so the rejection is too, and an arity model that lived behind an edition gate would show up here.
      *> The ACCEPT side is conformance:2023/l1_integer_family_notes and conformance:85/l1_integer_floor_85.
      *> Expected: COBOLNET1504, the §15.3 argument-count diagnostic.
