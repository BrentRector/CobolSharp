/// ⛔ THE STRUCTURAL CLAMP ON HOW A FILE CLAUSE'S data-name OPERAND IS CAPTURED AND RESOLVED (kb/Work PB489).
/// <para>The defect was ONE LINE written in five places and ONE LOOKUP written in four: a clause reduced its
/// written <c>dataReference</c> to <c>d.cobolWord()?.GetText()</c> — the FIRST word, so every IN/OF qualifier
/// was discarded — and then resolved that bare word with <c>ByName.TryGetValue(n, out var l) ? l[0] : null</c>,
/// a first-match lookup with no uniqueness test. Both halves are silent: the LINAGE clause built a program's
/// whole logical page on another data item's value, and the compile output was EMPTY.</para>
/// <para>The fix is structural — one capture (<c>ClauseDataName</c>, which also refuses the shapes a
/// <i>data-name-n</i> position does not admit) and one resolver (<c>ResolveClauseOperand</c>, over the single
/// ISO §8.4.2.2 candidate-set matcher <c>DataBinder.QualifiedCandidates</c>) — so the guard has to be that the
/// OLD SHAPES DO NOT COME BACK. A behavioural test proves today's clauses are right
/// (<c>ClauseOperandQualificationSpecTests</c>); this one keeps the NEXT clause automatic, which is the half a
/// behavioural test cannot reach: a new clause written with the old idiom would pass every existing test.</para>
/// <para>⚠ It reads SOURCE TEXT, which is unusual here and deliberate. The property is "no second copy of this
/// rule exists", and a second copy is by definition something no run-time observation of the first can see.</para>
