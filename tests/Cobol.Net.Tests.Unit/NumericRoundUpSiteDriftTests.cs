/// ⛔ THE DRIFT TEST for the "rounded up to the next whole number" landing (kb/Work PB142-B).
/// <para>The standard says that phrase in exactly TWO normative places — §14.7.9.3 GR1 (the RETRY phrase's
/// arithmetic-expression-1, an n-TIMES count) and §14.9.3.4 GR1 (ALLOCATE's arithmetic-expression-1, a byte
/// count) — and for a long time only ONE of them implemented it. ALLOCATE ceilinged (kb/Work PB151); RETRY
/// reached <c>NumericRenderer.Align(…, 0)</c>, whose every lane passes <c>CobolRounding.Truncation</c>, so
/// <c>RETRY 1.5 TIMES</c> emitted 1 re-attempt where GR1 requires 2 and <c>RETRY 0.5 TIMES</c> emitted 0,
/// silently degrading to the no-retry case. That is the one-rule-two-places shape: the fix was to hoist the
/// round-up into <c>NumericRenderer.AlignRoundedUp</c> and give BOTH clauses that one place.</para>
/// <para>This test is what keeps "one place" true. It is a SOURCE-TEXT check on purpose: the defect was never
/// that the helper computed the wrong thing, it was that a call site chose the wrong helper, and only the call
/// sites can witness that. The behavioural half — that the helper itself ceilings, and that the emitted RETRY
/// count really is the ceiling — lives in <c>CobolFileLockTests</c> and the conformance goldens.</para>
/// <para>Proven to FAIL before it was trusted: pointing <c>RetryTimes</c> back at <c>Align(…, 0)</c> makes
/// <see cref="EveryRoundUpRuledEmitSite_UsesAlignRoundedUp"/> red by name.</para>
