/// added: <b>the ambient flag a runtime raise helper READS is the flag the emitter SETS for the exception-name
/// that helper raises.</b>
///
/// <para><b>Why this test exists.</b> The rule is one sentence — "if checking for an exception that occurs is not
/// enabled, no exception condition is raised" — but it is applied once per (flag, name) pair, and the pair used to
/// be transcribed twice: once in <c>EcEmitter</c>'s gate table (which flag the statement guard sets when a TURN
/// enables the name) and once by hand in the helper body (which flag the raise site tests). Nothing compared them.
/// A helper written with a NEIGHBOUR's checking flag — one word, in a body identical to its twenty-one siblings —
/// is silent in both directions: <c>TURN {name} CHECKING ON</c> does not arm the raise, and enabling some
/// unrelated condition does. The pairing is asserted BEHAVIOURALLY here (invoke the helper, observe what it
/// raises and under which flag) rather than by reading names, so a helper that raises the right name through the
/// wrong flag cannot pass.</para>
