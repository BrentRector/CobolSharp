/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>1. Never wrap.</b> D1 evaluates the exact intrinsic family as unscaled <see cref="Int128"/> values, and
/// §14.7.5 rule 5 makes an arithmetic operation that takes the intermediate outside the implementor's checked range
/// the SIZE ERROR condition — not a modular wrap. PB32 wrote that policy but implemented it only for MEDIAN and
/// MIDRANGE, naming the helpers after MEDIAN's halving; SUM's <c>s += x</c> and RANGE's <c>max - min</c> then sat
/// unguarded for eight months and returned a SIGN-FLIPPED value through an <c>ON SIZE ERROR</c> phrase that was not
/// taken. A boundary pin per function would have the same blind spot, so the completeness half is driven by
/// REFLECTION over the whole exact-carrier entry-point set: every public entry that takes and returns only carrier
/// values is either pinned below AND at the boundary, or named in <see cref="CannotLeaveTheCarrier"/> with its
/// reason. A new one is neither, and the build goes red.</para>
/// <para><b>2. A standard mode never touches the carrier's boundary at all.</b> §15.4.1 r1 admits no approximation
/// under STANDARD-DECIMAL / STANDARD-BINARY: the returned value shall EQUAL the equivalent arithmetic expression,
/// and §8.8.1.5.2 r1 converts each argument to the SDIDI individually — so no common scale is ever formed. The
/// NATIVE arms align first, and alignment multiplies (a 31-digit integer beside a scale-18 operand needs 49
/// digits), so exactly the arms that CROSS-ALIGN must route to their <c>…Dec</c> bodies under a standard mode.
/// That routing was also built one arm at a time — PB62 moved the summing family, PB252 found MOD and REM still
/// on the Int128 lane — so the set is now checked against the switch that defines it.</para>
/// <para><b>3. An arm that can be HANDED an SDIDI operand has a Dec body at all.</b> Invariant 2 asks which arms
/// MUST leave the carrier under a standard mode; kb/Work PB620 is the prior question, and the one nothing asked:
/// an arm with no <c>RenderDec</c> label falls through to the exact switch whatever the argument's carrier, where
/// <c>Arg</c> lands an SDIDI operand at max(receiver scale, 6). COMBINED-DATETIME was that arm — the one §15.4.1
/// r1 function PB56's sweep left on the landing intake — and its own clause could not see the defect, because the
