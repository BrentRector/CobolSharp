/// ⛔ THE DENOMINATOR IS COMPLETE — per clause, counted, every build.
///
/// <para><c>docs/rearchitecture/spec-rule-catalog.json</c> is the enumeration the PHASE-14 traceability
/// inventory is built from, and its row count is the denominator v1.0 is defined against (owner decision D13:
/// zero GAP = P14 done). Every completeness critic inside <c>scripts/spec/extract_rule_catalog.py</c> asks
/// "did this rule block yield SOMETHING?" — and a block that yields 16 of its 42 rules passes all of them,
/// because 16 is not zero. That is precisely what happened (fix-queue PB689): the transcription rendered the
/// in-clause group label <c>SEQUENTIAL FILES</c> as <c>## SEQUENTIAL FILES</c> inside §14.9.51.4's general
/// rules, the block scan closed the block at it, and GR17–GR42 of the WRITE statement — twenty-six normative
/// rules including the line-sequential '71' status — never became inventory rows. Five clauses were short by
/// sixty rules in total, and the published GAP was therefore measured against a denominator that flattered the
/// project without anyone being able to see it.</para>
///
/// <para>So this gate counts. For every clause the catalog holds rules for, the ordinals the TRANSCRIPTION
/// PRINTS at column 0 must equal the rows the CATALOG HOLDS — no segmentation reasoning, no vocabulary, just
/// two counts that have to agree. The extractor may decide what an ordinal is CALLED (top-level <c>GR-x-7</c>
/// versus sub-list <c>GR-x-L3.2</c>); it may never lose one, and an ordinal it cannot place is filed as a nest
/// and reported. A clause below its printed count has lost rules whatever the segmentation says, and a clause
/// above it has invented them — the more dangerous direction, because inflation looks like thoroughness.</para>
///
/// <para>⚠ This is a SPEC-side gate that deliberately does not run the Python extractor: it re-derives the
/// printed count from <c>specs/ISO_COBOL.md</c> independently, so it can contradict the code that built the
/// catalog. A critic that reuses the machinery it audits cannot see that machinery's bug.</para>
///
/// <para>⚠ <see cref="TheseChecks_ActuallyFail_OnAFabricatedSpec"/> exists because a gate that has only ever
/// been observed green is indistinguishable from one that inspects nothing
/// (<c>feedback_green_gates_arent_evidence</c>). It re-runs both predicates over a spec built to break them.</para>
