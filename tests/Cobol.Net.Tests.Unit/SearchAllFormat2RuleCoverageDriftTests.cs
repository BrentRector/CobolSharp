/// structural reason: they all read either the OCCURS KEY phrase of identifier-1 or the WHEN phrase decomposed
/// into its Format-2 operands, and neither existed as a model. <see cref="CobolNet.Binding.Validation"/>'s
/// <c>SearchAllFormat2Rules</c> builds both and writes each rule as a predicate over them.
/// <para>The value of that shape is that the NEXT Format-2 rule is a predicate rather than another tree walk —
/// and this test is what keeps the claim honest. It SCRAPES the Format-2 syntax rules out of
/// <c>specs/ISO_COBOL.md</c> rather than listing them, so a rule added to the transcription (a later edition, or
/// a transcription repair that recovers one the OCR lost) turns red here until it is both implemented and
/// assigned a diagnostic code. A hand-written list of "the seven rules" would have gone quietly stale instead.
