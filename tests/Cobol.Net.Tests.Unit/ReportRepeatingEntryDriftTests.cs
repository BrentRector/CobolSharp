/// ⛔ REPETITION IN A REPORT GROUP IS A SUBTREE REPLAY, AND EVERY CLAUSE RIDES IT FOR FREE (kb/Work PB565).
/// ISO §13.18.38.4 GR10 says a repeating entry "causes the entry to define integer-2 distinct report items" and
/// GR11 says every clause has "the same effect on each repetition as they would on a single data item without
/// the OCCURS clause" — so the ONE correct shape is to bind the entry's subtree once per repetition, not to
/// teach each clause about repetition. <c>DataBinder.BindReportEntries</c> does exactly that, which is why
/// §13.18.63.4 GR21's import of GR9 (a VALUE reaches every occurrence), GR22's OCCURS-DEPENDING suppressor and
/// §13.18.64's VARYING counters all became correct at once.
///
/// <para>Three guards keep it structural:</para>
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>the replay call is the ONLY repetition site — no clause binder may loop over an OCCURS count itself;</item>
/// <item>every <c>ReportColumnKindModel</c> is handled at BOTH placement readers (the emitter's compose switch
/// and the binder's line-width walk) — a new placement kind that reaches only one of them is this repo's
/// most reproducible defect, the two-arm dispatch with one arm fixed;</item>
/// <item>BOTH AXES ride the one replay, and the axis is decided in ONE place: §13.18.38.4 GR10/GR12 split
/// a/b (COLUMN) from c/d (LINE), so an entry's integer-3 is a horizontal interval or a vertical one but never
/// both, and a second axis test would be a second copy of that split.</item>
