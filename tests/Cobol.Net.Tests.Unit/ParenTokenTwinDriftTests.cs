/// ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE LESSON OF fix-queue PB48. Splitting one lexeme into two
/// token types — the argument-list <c>(</c> of ISO §8.4.3.2.3 SR6 versus an arithmetic grouping <c>(</c> — is
/// invisible to the compiler's type system: every existing `t.Type is LPAREN` keeps compiling and silently
/// stops matching half the parens it used to. The GRAMMAR consumers were swept (`functionCall`, `refModPart`);
/// the CODE consumers were not, and the legacy oracle's <c>MapFunctionArgTokens</c> — which maps a nested call's
/// argument tokens down to their SUBSCRIPT-mode twins, and already had an arm for the FNARG_SEPARATOR twin —
/// silently dropped the paren twins. Cost: <b>31 NIST IF-suite regressions</b>, every one a clean compile that
/// threw <c>IndexOutOfRangeException</c> at RUN TIME, found only by the 11-minute comprehensive battery. The
/// wave-local gate, the full greenfield Conformance suite, the unit suite and the GnuCOBOL differential were
/// ALL GREEN on that tree (feedback_scan_all_similar, feedback_two_arm_dispatch).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ THE RULE IS "DECIDE", NOT "INCLUDE" — a blanket helper would be WRONG here, and that is the whole design.
/// The sites genuinely differ: <c>ZeroTokenRewriter</c> must see grouping parens ONLY (including the FNARG twin
/// is precisely the defect PB48 fixed), while <c>MapFunctionArgTokens</c> must see both. So this asserts that
/// the author CONSIDERED the twin, and leaves which answer is right to the site.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ It is a SOURCE-FORM guard because no runtime test can see the omission: the missing arm is not a wrong
/// answer at any single site, it is a whole category of input silently taking a different path. The
/// <c>DiagnosticEmitFormDriftTests</c> precedent — "no runtime test can see a mistake only a caller can make".
