/// items"</i> — and the CORRESPONDING screen asked the boolean <c>DataItem.IsGroup</c> instead. The fifth kind,

/// ran as a silent no-op. A conformance golden proves the bit case is refused today; it cannot prove that the
/// screen still asks a SET tomorrow, which is the property that was missing. This pins the set.</para>
