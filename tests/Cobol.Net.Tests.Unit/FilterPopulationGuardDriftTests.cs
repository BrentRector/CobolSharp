/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// vstest answers a filter that matches nothing with a PASSING RUN OF ZERO TESTS: exit 0, no warning, no red.
/// So every filter is a CLAIM about which tests ran, and every claim needs its evidence
/// (<c>feedback_verdict_evidence_invariant</c> — a run must assert its population;
/// <c>feedback_measure_the_selectors_complement</c> — a selector is evidence about what it RETURNED, never
/// about what it dropped). The same hole has now been found FOUR times in three shapes: PB287 (four CI filters
/// keyed <c>Class.Method</c> that the A13 partition split had made unmatchable), PB708 (a dead term OR'd among
/// live ones inside the local gate's filter), PB751 (the two doc regenerators, each of whose ONE test is the
/// whole regeneration), PB752 (the two single-purpose CI legs, one of them the roadmap's fatal-challenge
/// criterion). Each was fixed at its own site; none of the fixes could stop the fifth site inheriting the hole.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This test is that stop (CLAUDE.md rule 5 — prefer the shape that makes the NEXT case automatic, and pair it
/// with a drift test so "automatic" stays true). A new script or CI leg that filters a test run is covered the
/// moment it is written, with no registration step to forget, because the scan is over the FILE TREE and not
/// over a list.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ TWO population assertions are admissible, and they are recognized by SHAPE rather than by a list of
/// blessed job names (CLAUDE.md rule 8 — no hand-maintained list where a structure belongs):

/// re-discovers the population with <c>--list-tests</c> and asserts the shards SUM to it. That is a STRONGER
