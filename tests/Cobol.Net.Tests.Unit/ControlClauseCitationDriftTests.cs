/// "ISO §13.18.16.3 SR3" for an UNRESOLVABLE CONTROL operand and <c>ReportWriterEmitter</c> cited the SAME SR3
/// for a float/INDEX one — but SR3 is "Data-name-1 shall not be subject to any OCCURS clauses", a real clause
/// answering a different question. <c>cite.py --check</c> on the clause NUMBER alone passes either way, which
/// is exactly why a number-only check is not enough and this test reads the RULE TEXT.</para>
