/// ⛔ THE GATE OVER THE FETCH THAT FEEDS <see cref="ExternalCorpusPopulationDriftTests"/> — kb/Work PB897.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <c>scripts/fetch-gnucobol-tests.ps1</c> populates the GPL corpus that the population drift gate measures. It
/// carried three independent faults that together made that gate RED in every fresh worktree, permanently:
/// it DELETED <c>tests/external/gnucobol</c> before an extraction it then failed to perform; it passed the
/// archive as a drive-letter path, which GNU tar reads as <c>host:path</c> (<c>Cannot connect to E: resolve
/// failed</c>, exit 128) and Windows' bsdtar accepts; and Git-for-Windows' GNU tar cannot read a <c>.tar.xz</c>
/// at all because it shells out to an <c>xz</c> binary it does not ship. Which <c>tar</c> happened to be first
/// on PATH therefore decided whether the corpus existed, per machine — so the two population reds became "the
/// known worktree shape" every implementer brief told agents to ignore. <b>A red everyone is told to ignore is
/// a gate that has stopped gating</b> (<c>feedback_green_gates_arent_evidence</c>), which is why the fetch now
/// has a gate of its own.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The script's <c>-SelfTest</c> switch drives <c>Invoke-CorpusExtraction</c> — the REAL function the real fetch
/// calls, not a copy — against a synthetic <c>.tar.xz</c> in a temporary sandbox: no network, no repository
/// state, and the FAILURE branches are exercised, not merely the success one. This fact runs it. Asserting the
/// individual check lines (not just the verdict) is deliberate: a self-test quietly reduced to its happy path
/// would still print PASS.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A missing PowerShell is a LOUD failure and not a skip, exactly as a missing Python is for the drift gate
/// next door: <c>pwsh</c> is how both CI legs already run this script (<c>shell: pwsh</c> in
/// <c>.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml</c>), so a host without it cannot fetch the corpus either
/// (<c>feedback_verdict_evidence_invariant</c>).
