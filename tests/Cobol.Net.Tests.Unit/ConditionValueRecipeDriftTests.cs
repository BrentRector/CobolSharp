/// literal-4. §8.8.4.5.3 GR3 then makes the condition true exactly when the stored value is one of the
/// condition's values, so the STORE and the TEST are required to answer identically — a SET followed by its
/// own IF is an identity. When the rule is written down twice they drift, and they did: the SET emitter's
/// private recipe stored the raw literal text where the VALUE clause composes an edited image (PIC ZZ9.99
/// held `10    `, not ` 10.00`), scaled a float literal at the item's scale of zero (VALUE 0.5 stored 0),
/// ignored BLANK WHEN ZERO, had no runtime compose for a PICTURE format-2 (LOCALE) variable, and handed a
/// <c>long</c> to the <c>string</c> field of a whole-group-aliased numeric item — a Roslyn CS1503 that failed
