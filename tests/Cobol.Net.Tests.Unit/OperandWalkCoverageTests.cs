/// over an operand wrapper's subtree with an arm per bindable shape, and its fallback used to
/// <c>return new BoundNumLiteral("0")</c> — so a grammar alternative nobody wrote an arm for did not fail, it
/// became ZERO. The grammar's <c>valueOperand : arithmeticExpression | nonNumericLiteral</c> names
/// <c>nonNumericLiteral</c> DIRECTLY, bypassing the <c>literal</c> wrapper the walk knew, and that alternative
/// had no arm: <c>IF "ABC" IS POSITIVE</c> compiled clean and evaluated <c>0 &gt; 0</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>⚠ AND THE GUARD THAT WAS CREDITED WITH PREVENTING IT NEVER LOOKED.</b> The fallback's own comment
/// said "ArithmeticSendingOperandDriftTests exists to keep the grammar from growing one this walk cannot see".
/// That test compares the four ARITHMETIC operand rules' bodies to each other and never mentions
/// <c>comparisonOperand</c> or <c>valueOperand</c> — the rule the walk was actually failing on. A green guard
/// over the wrong subject is worse than none, because it stops anyone looking
/// (feedback_green_gates_arent_evidence). THIS test guards the property that comment claimed.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The property, stated exactly:</b> for every rule whose subtree the walk can be handed, EVERY
/// alternative must reach at least one arm of the walk — directly, or through a wrapper rule that itself has the
/// property. An alternative that reaches none is a shape the walk drains on, which is now a
/// <c>BoundExprError</c> at bind time rather than a silent zero, but is still a hole in the binder and a
/// BUILD-time failure here. That is the shape that makes the NEXT case automatic: a new <c>valueOperand</c>
/// alternative fails this test instead of degrading to a wrong answer in the field.</para>
///
/// <para>⚠ It reads the GRAMMAR SOURCE, not the generated parser: the property is about what the <c>.g4</c>
