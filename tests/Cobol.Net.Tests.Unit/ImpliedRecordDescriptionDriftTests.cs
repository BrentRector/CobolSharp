/// consumers each carried their own null arm — registration on the sequential emitter (which served REPORT files
/// only), registration on the keyed emitter (which returned outright), the READ record-area store and the
/// implicit INTO move. Both organizations therefore produced NO file connector and the first I-O verb aborted the
/// run unit. These tests are the ratchet on the repair: the FIRST pins that the area exists, is a GROUP and is
