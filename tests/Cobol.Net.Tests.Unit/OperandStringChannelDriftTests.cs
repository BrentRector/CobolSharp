/// ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. <c>OperandText.AsString</c> (the DISPLAY / MOVE / STRING channel) and
/// <c>IntrinsicRenderer.StrArgVisitor</c> (the intrinsic-argument channel) are two visitors over the same leaf
/// set. <c>StrArgVisitor</c> delegates only SOME leaves and answers the rest itself, so it inherited neither
/// <c>AsString</c>'s figurative arm nor its ALL-literal arm — and <c>FUNCTION LOWER-CASE(SPACE)</c>, legal
/// source, compiled clean and aborted at RUN TIME with "intrinsic string argument 'BoundFigurative'"
/// (fix-queue PB25). That was ONE RULE WRITTEN IN TWO PLACES with only one copy right. PB25 routed the two
/// offending leaves to <c>AsString</c>; the guard its own evidence file prescribed was never built, and this
/// is it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ <b>THE TWO CHANNELS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO AGREE, AND A TEST ASSERTING THAT WOULD BE WRONG.</b> A numeric
/// literal is a legal DISPLAY operand and NOT a legal string-argument operand; the computed-operand arms differ
/// because the intrinsic channel re-enters <c>RenderString</c> for a nested string-class function where the
/// DISPLAY channel has a loud stage. So this encodes a PER-LEAF EXPECTATION with the intended answer stated,
/// exactly as PB49 required — never a blanket "these two functions are equal".
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚙ <b>AND PB49's SECOND QUESTION HAS AN ANSWER RATHER THAN A GUARD.</b> It asked for the same check on the
/// NUMERIC channels. Measured: the whole compiler has four <c>IBoundOperandVisitor</c> implementations —
/// <c>StrArgVisitor</c> and <c>AsStringVisitor</c> (string), <c>IsStringVisitor</c> (a bool classifier), and
/// <c>NumericRenderer</c>. <b>NumericRenderer is the ONLY numeric one</b>; <c>OperandText.NumericIntrinsicText</c>
/// is a helper it is called from, not a parallel visitor. There is no numeric twin to drift from, so there is
/// nothing to guard — asserted below so that stops being true loudly rather than silently.
