/// ⛔ A NEW <see cref="SendingRef"/> MEMBER MUST DEFAULT TO <b>CHECKED</b>, NEVER TO EXEMPT.
///
/// <para>Each reading in <c>SendingRefRules</c> IS one standard rule's exemption list. The lists are small and
/// the enum is small, so the tempting spelling of a four-entry list is its complement — <c>r is Normal</c> — and
/// that spelling is a trap with a delay fuse: it is correct only while those four members are the WHOLE enum, and
/// it silently EXEMPTS every member added afterwards. kb/Work PB844 added <see cref="SendingRef.MoveToNumeric"/>
/// for §14.9.25.4 GR6 d) 1, and under the old <c>r is Normal</c> reading of §14.6.13.2 rule 3 that member would
/// have turned OFF the EC-DATA-NOT-FINITE check for <c>MOVE &lt;COMP-2&gt; TO &lt;PIC 9(5)&gt;</c> — a raise the
/// standard requires, lost to an enum member that never mentioned floating point.</para>
///
/// <para>So this test states each rule's exemption SET explicitly and asserts the complement: every other member,
/// <b>including one added tomorrow</b>, must come back CHECKED. Adding a member that genuinely earns an exemption
/// means adding it to the set here, in the same change set that adds it to the clause's own reading — which is
/// the point: the exemption becomes a decision someone had to write down twice, with the clause text in front of
/// them, instead of a default nobody chose.</para>

/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>§14.6.13.2 <b>rule 2</b> (EC-DATA-INCOMPATIBLE, a fixed-point numeric sending item) — exempt in a class
/// condition and in VALIDATE.</item>
/// <item>§14.6.13.2 <b>rule 3</b> (EC-DATA-NOT-FINITE, a standard-float sending operand) — those two, plus a sign
/// condition and a same-usage MOVE.</item>
/// <item>§14.9.25.4 <b>GR6 d) 1</b> (EC-DATA-INCOMPATIBLE, an alphanumeric or national sending operand) — the one
/// rule whose list is an opt-IN, because GR6 d)'s own scope is the single context "when a numeric or
