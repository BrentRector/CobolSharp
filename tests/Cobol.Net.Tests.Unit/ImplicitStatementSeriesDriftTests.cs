/// <para>The standard states ONE rule SEVEN times, once per multi-operand verb: "the result of executing this …
/// statement is the same as if a separate … statement had been written for each … in the same order", followed by
/// "If an implicit … statement results in the execution of a declarative procedure that executes a RESUME
/// statement with the NEXT STATEMENT phrase, processing resumes at the next implicit … statement, if any."
/// A verb that binds its operand list into ONE statement site has no boundary for that resumption point, and the
/// failure is SILENT: the declarative runs, control leaves the whole verb, and every remaining operand is skipped
/// with no diagnostic anywhere (measured on INITIALIZE — <c>INITIALIZE A B</c> left B at its old value).</para>
/// <para>So the census is taken FROM THE SPEC, not from a hand-kept list: whichever verbs the standard gives this
/// rule to must bind through <c>BoundImplicitSeries</c>. An eighth verb — or an implementation of the one verb
/// currently exempt because its facility is owner-declined and it binds to nothing — fails this test rather than
/// shipping the defect again.</para>
