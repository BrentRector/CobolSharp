///
/// <para>Rule 2 — <i>"In a MOVE statement, at least one of the data items is an elementary data item and the
/// resulting move is valid according to the rules for the MOVE statement"</i> — sends the CORRESPONDING pairing
/// decision to the MOVE statement's own rules, whose category half is §14.9.25.3 SR10, Table 16. That table has
/// exactly ONE home, <see cref="MoveTable16"/>, whose own header says <i>"asking it in two places is how the two
/// answers drift"</i>. <c>CorrespondingBinder</c> asked it in a second place for a year, and the two answers
/// drifted in BOTH directions at once — five measured cells, three pairs moved that Table 16 refuses and two
/// silently dropped that it admits.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What this test is for.</b> A conformance golden proves the cells are right TODAY. It cannot
/// prove that the CORRESPONDING filter is still the SAME FUNCTION as the direct-MOVE guard tomorrow, which is
/// the property that was lost. So this walks the whole modeled Table-16 position matrix and asserts the binder's
/// rule-2 filter agrees with <see cref="MoveTable16.DataItemRefusal"/> on EVERY cell — which it can only do by
/// being a delegation. Re-introduce one private arm and this fails; it was verified to fail against the deleted
/// <c>CorrMoveValid</c> on eight sender rows.</para>
///
/// <para><b>And it pins the SECOND half, which is not Table 16 at all</b> (kb/Work PB391). §14.9.25.3 SR10 — the
/// rule that routes to the table — governs only <i>"all other cases not described in Syntax rules 8 and 9"</i>,
/// so rule 2 also owes SR8 (a fixed-width binary sender needs a numeric or numeric-edited receiver) and SR9 (a
/// variable-length group operand needs a compatible group opposite). Asking <see cref="MoveTable16.Refusal"/>
/// alone skipped both, MEASURED: a <c>BINARY-LONG</c> namesake paired with a <c>PIC X(5)</c> one and overwrote
/// it while the written MOVE of the same two items was refused COBOLNET0819, and a variable-length-group
/// namesake paired with an elementary one and reached the run time as a <c>NotImplementedCobolFeatureException</c>.
/// The matrix carries a <c>Binary-long</c> and a <c>Variable-length-group</c> position for exactly that reason,
/// and <see cref="TheBoundAndItemKeyedShapeEntriesAnswerTogether"/> pins the two-arm split the fix could have
/// re-created.</para>
///
/// <para><b>And it pins the trap the deletion sprang.</b> <see cref="MoveTable16.Refusal"/> ADMITS a
/// pointer × pointer pair — it screens group / boolean / national / alphabetic / numeric and returns null for
/// everything else — so routing rule 2 to it without rule 4's class exclusion would have converted a silent
/// EXCLUSION into a silent pointer copy. <see cref="CorrespondingRule4ClassExclusionIsTheOnlyThingRefusingAPointerPair"/>
