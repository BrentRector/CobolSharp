///
/// <para>ISO §8.4.3.1.2 gives <i>identifier</i> eleven general formats. Two of them are not a data-name
/// reference and therefore need their own grammar alternative at every operand site: Format 1, the
/// function-identifier (<c>functionCall</c>), and Format 4, the inline method invocation
/// (<c>inlineMethodInvocation</c>). Their exclusions are word-for-word twins — §8.4.3.2.3 SR1 "A
/// function-identifier shall not be specified as a receiving operand" and §8.4.3.4.3 SR1 "Inline method
/// invocation shall not be specified as a receiving operand" — so the set of positions that admits one
/// admits the other, and the receiving rules admit neither.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why a test and not a shared rule.</b> The obvious shape is ONE <c>sendingIdentifier</c> rule used
/// everywhere, and it is blocked for exactly the reason <c>ArithmeticSendingOperandDriftTests</c> records:
/// the FROZEN legacy compiler shares this grammar and reads <c>.dataReference()</c> / <c>.literal()</c> /
/// <c>.functionCall()</c> off these contexts BY NAME, so a collapse or an alias breaks its build until
/// PHASE 15 CUT 2 deletes it. The alternatives therefore stay per-site and this test is what makes the
/// pairing mechanical instead of a hand-maintained list (CLAUDE.md rule 5): the next rule to gain
/// <c>functionCall</c> fails here until it gains Format 4 too. Collapse both at CUT 2 and delete this with
/// <c>ArithmeticSendingOperandDriftTests</c>.</para>
///
/// <para>⚠ It reads the GRAMMAR SOURCE, not the generated parser: the property is about what the <c>.g4</c>
/// admits, and a generated-parser check would pass on a rule that merely happens not to be exercised.</para>
