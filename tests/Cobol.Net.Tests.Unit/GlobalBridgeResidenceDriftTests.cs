/// ⛔ EVERY RESIDENCE A GLOBAL NAME CAN HAVE IS REACHABLE FROM A CONTAINED PROGRAM (kb/Work PB1009).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// ISO §13.18.27.3 SR1 b) admits GLOBAL on a level-1 entry "specified in the file, working-storage, local-storage,
/// or linkage section", and §13.18.27.4 GR2 lets a contained program "reference that name without describing it
/// again" — the storage stays the container's, reached through a ref-bridge to each container member a reference
/// renders. Those members differ by residence: a plain field, a Tier-B backing, the cell behind a cell-backed class,
/// a BASED item's address pointer, a carrier-resident formal's carrier, a table's index fields. The bridge list used
/// to be spelled per residence at its one call site, and two residences were missing — the carrier-resident formal
/// (the bridge wrote the accessor text <c>__lnkp0.Value</c> where a member name belongs: CS0106 on legal source)
/// and the BASED item's address pointer (CS0120). It is now ONE list,
/// <c>DataBinder.GlobalBridgesOf</c>, and this matrix is the drift pin: a residence a future change adds belongs
/// here as a row, and a row whose members the list forgets fails to compile.
/// Every row: the contained program has its OWN first formal (the container's carrier must not alias it), reads the
/// global (<c>INIT</c>) and stores through it (<c>NEWV</c>), and the container then sees the store.
