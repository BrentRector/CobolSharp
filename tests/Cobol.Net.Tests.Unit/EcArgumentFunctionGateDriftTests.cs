/// ⛔ THE EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION AMBIENT GATE MUST NOT DEPEND ON WHICH STATEMENT ENCLOSES THE FUNCTION REFERENCE
/// (fix-queue PB26). <b>ISO §15.3 item 14</b> attaches the condition to the reference — "If the evaluation of an
/// argument results in an incorrect value for that argument or for the returned value according to the rules
/// specified in the function definition … the EC-ARGUMENT-FUNCTION exception condition is set to exist" — with no
/// statement-kind qualification anywhere in it.
///
/// <para><b>What went wrong.</b> <c>EcBinder.DirectIntrinsic</c> was a hand-written switch over ~17 statement
/// kinds ending in <c>_ => false</c>, so the gate reached a statement only if someone had remembered its arm:
/// <c>FUNCTION LOG10(0)</c> raised in COMPUTE/MOVE/DISPLAY/IF and was SILENT in STRING. The list is now the
/// generated <c>BoundStatementTree.OwnValueParts</c>, discovered from the semantic model.</para>
///
/// <para>⚠ <b>WHAT THIS FILE DOES AND DOES NOT GUARD, stated because the honest boundary matters.</b> It pins the
/// SHAPE that broke — a value reached through a LIST OF HELPER RECORDS, which both the old switch and any
/// one-level walk miss. **Breadth across statement kinds is guarded BEHAVIOURALLY by the conformance golden**
/// <c>pb26_ec_argument_function_every_statement</c>, which runs a domain violation through each kind and asserts
/// the condition is raised. Two earlier attempts at a broad reflection guard here were UNSOUND and are recorded so
/// nobody rebuilds them: probing an uninitialized node cannot detect a missing arm, because the generated
