/// <c>DataBinder.KeyReference</c> — the FILE-CONTROL key helper, which keeps the base word and the IN/OF
/// qualifiers and DROPS the subscript and the reference modifier — or, for the <c>UPON</c> operand, with the
/// even weaker <c>cobolWord()?.GetText() ?? GetText()</c> first-word reduction. The consequences were measured
/// on the base tree and are all four kinds of harm at once: <c>SUM WS-CELL(2)</c> compiled and then ABORTED the
/// process at the first GENERATE; <c>SUM WS-TXT(1:2)</c> silently summed the whole item; <c>UPON CFT</c> named a
/// control footing and totalled nothing; <c>UPON NOSUCH</c> named nothing at all and was accepted.</para>
/// <para><b>The invariant.</b> An addend written as identifier-1 is an ORDINARY IDENTIFIER (ISO §8.4.3.1.2
/// Format 2, qualified-data-name-with-subscripts), so the capture keeps the WHOLE reference and the VALUE is
/// bound in the procedure phase through the one expression binder. Every <c>KeyReference</c> call in the report
/// binder therefore has to sit inside a NAMED capture helper that says which rules it screens — the guard below
/// is the containment check, and its adjudication table is where the one remaining bare arm is visible.</para>
/// <para>⭐ IT CARRIES NO COPY OF THE RULES. The SR5 / SR7 sentences are re-read from
/// <c>specs/ISO_COBOL.md</c> on every run (the <c>ControlClauseCitationDriftTests</c> pattern), so a
