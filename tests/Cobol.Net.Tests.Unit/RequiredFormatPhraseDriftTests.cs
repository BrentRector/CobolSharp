///
/// <para>ISO §5.2.6.2 makes BRACKETS the only convention that lets a portion of a general format be omitted, and
/// §5.2.2 makes an underlined keyword required subject to those conventions. So a conditional phrase printed on
/// its own line with NO brackets is MANDATORY, and a grammar that writes it <c>phrase?</c> silently UNDER-REJECTS
/// — the mirror of the audit that hunts optional words we wrongly require
/// (<c>scripts/spec/audit_grammar_optional_words.py</c>), and the defect kb/Work PB350 reports: RETURN's AT END
/// was optional in the grammar, so a RETURN with no AT END compiled at every edition and, at end of data, control
/// fell THROUGH the statement onto a record area §14.9.34.4 GR3 leaves undefined.</para>
///
/// <para>ONE such line is not a pattern worth a hand-maintained list (CLAUDE.md rule 8) — so this SCRAPES them
/// out of <c>specs/ISO_COBOL.md</c> instead, and asserts that every one is adjudicated WITH THE MECHANISM THAT
/// ENFORCES IT, and that each adjudication's stated mechanism is still there. A transcription repair, a new
/// edition's format, or a grammar restructure that moves the enforcement point fails here.</para>
///
/// <para>⚠ The scrape asserts its own SHAPE before comparing — the block count, that RETURN's unbracketed line IS
