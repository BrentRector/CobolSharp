/// has not built, an ill-formed OPERAND, and an illegal PLACEMENT — and <c>StatementEmitter</c> rendered all
/// three as the same <c>NotImplemented.Run(...)</c>. Two consequences, both measured: the two user-error jobs
/// told the programmer THE COMPILER was incomplete when in fact THE SOURCE was wrong, and on a path the flow
/// skipped they said NOTHING AT ALL, so illegal source compiled, ran to normal completion, and shipped.
/// <para>The separation is structural. The user-error jobs report their own rule and bind to
/// <c>BoundNop</c>; what is left on the carrier is the DEFERRAL, and it is announced from the ONE place it
/// cannot be forgotten — <c>StatementBinder.BindStatement</c>, the single funnel every statement passes
/// through, which already positions the diagnostic cursor (kb/Work PB82). A new <c>BoundUnsupported</c>

/// is exactly what the per-site habit failed at (two of START's five refusals carried a diagnostic and three

/// wrong: the announce must NOT fail the compile (a deferral is COBOL.NET's gap, not the source's error, so a
/// program whose unimplemented statement is never reached still has a defined meaning and still runs); it must
/// NOT fire on programs it has no business touching; and a violated SYNTAX RULE must draw an ERROR naming the
/// rule, never this warning. A test that asserted only "some diagnostic appeared" would pass in every one of
/// those failure modes (feedback_green_gates_arent_evidence).</para>
