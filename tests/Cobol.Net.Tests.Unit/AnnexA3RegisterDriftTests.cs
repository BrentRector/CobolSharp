/// COBOL, the implementor shall document the processor-dependent language elements for which the implementation
/// claims support", and "The absence of processor-dependent elements from an implementation shall be specified in
/// the implementor's user documentation." A row of that register is therefore a conformance artifact, and its
/// citation is load-bearing — a reader who cannot reach the clause cannot check the claim.

/// in the § column — <c>13.x</c> on rows 5, 12, 13, 26 and 40, plus <c>8.x</c>, <c>9.x</c> and <c>11.x</c> — and
/// they had been there since the document was created. PB292's own note recorded the class as FIVE rows, because
