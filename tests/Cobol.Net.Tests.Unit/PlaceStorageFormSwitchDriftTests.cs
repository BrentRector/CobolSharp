/// ⛔ A SWITCH OVER A <c>Place</c>'s STORAGE FORM MUST NOT MEET A <c>PlaceDecorator</c> IN ITS DEFAULT ARM

/// <para>A <c>Place</c> is either a STORAGE form — <c>MemberPlace</c>, <c>RedefViewPlace</c>,
/// <c>DynTablePlace</c>, <c>CapacityRegisterPlace</c>, <c>RenamesPlace</c> — or a <c>PlaceDecorator</c> over one,
/// which answers a question about the OPERAND (its occurs-depending extent, its reference modifier, its as-if
/// elementary image view) and never changes where the storage is. A consumer that asks "which storage form is
/// this?" and writes <c>_ =&gt; null</c> therefore rejects, silently and at run time, every operand that happens
/// to carry a decoration — while the identical undecorated operand works.</para>
/// <para>That is not hypothetical: it was measured three times over. An occurs-depending group is an
/// <c>OdoGroupPlace</c> wrapping a <c>MemberPlace</c>, and it fell into the default arm of INITIALIZE's receiver
/// cursor factory (plain COBOL-85 <c>INITIALIZE</c> of an ODO group aborted the run unit), of MOVE
/// CORRESPONDING's <c>CorrAccess.Create</c> (<c>SUBTRACT CORRESPONDING</c> over two ODO groups aborted — a
/// group kind §14.9.44.3 SR6 admits BY NAME), and of <c>FUNCTION LENGTH</c>'s variable-length sum, which peeled
/// exactly one known decorator kind and staged everything else loud.</para>
/// <para>So the rule is enforced here rather than remembered: a storage-form switch either asks
/// <see cref="CobolNet.Binding.Model.Place.Undecorated"/>, or handles decorators itself (an arm naming
/// <c>PlaceDecorator</c> or any concrete decorator type), or carries an adjudicated exemption below with its
/// reason. A NEW decorator kind — or a new switch — then cannot silently rejoin the hole.</para>
