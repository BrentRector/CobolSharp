/// write-side rule.
///
/// <para><b>The derivation.</b> §14.9.35.4 GR4: <i>"The successful execution of the REWRITE statement releases a
/// logical record to the operating environment."</i> §14.9.51.4 GR12 says the same of WRITE. §9.1.15 3) makes
/// the concurrency legal: <i>"The sharing with all other mode allows concurrent access to a physical file
/// through other file connectors specifying input, I-O, or extend mode."</i> And §14.9.30.4 GR21 c)/d) say what
/// the reader then owes — the record selected is <i>"the first existing record in the physical file whose
/// relative key number is greater than the file position indicator if NEXT is specified or implied"</i>, and
/// that record <i>"is made available in the record area associated with file-name-1"</i>. The physical file, at
/// the READ. The standard has no rule about buffering because the read-ahead is entirely ours.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What PB753 was.</b> The sequential connector reads through a <see cref="StreamReader"/> over a
/// buffered <see cref="FileStream"/> — two buffers. A sibling connector's REWRITE reached the file and reported
/// '00', and the reader went on serving its snapshot: measured over 300 four-byte records, <c>R-3=OLD</c> while
/// the file on disk held <c>NEW</c>, with '00' from every statement. The invalidation rule was already written
/// down in <c>SeekToRecord</c>'s doc comment — <i>"the reader buffers ahead of the base stream, so seeking the
/// stream alone would keep serving stale characters"</i> — for the connector's OWN seek and never for a
/// sibling's write: one rule, one arm.</para>
///
/// <para><b>So the guard is the rule, not the reported arm:</b> a shared reader may serve characters only from
/// a buffer that agrees with the physical file's release generation, and only ONE buffer may stand between the
/// connector and the medium. Both halves are needed and each is measured here: the generation alone left the
/// <see cref="FileStream"/>'s own 4096-byte buffer serving the superseded bytes (<see cref="FileStream.Seek"/>
/// reuses its read buffer when the target lands inside it), and an unbuffered handle alone would leave the
/// <see cref="StreamReader"/>'s 1024 characters just as stale.</para>
///
/// <para>The matrix is deliberately not the reported case: every sequential framing, a buffer-crossing AND a
/// sub-buffer record count, reader-first AND writer-first, the clause-less pair kb/Work PB740 admitted, plus the
/// controls that must stay green — the sibling APPEND, the lone I-O connector rewriting its own records, and the
