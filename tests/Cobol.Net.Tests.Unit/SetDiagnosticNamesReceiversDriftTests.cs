/// ⛔ THE DRIFT TEST for the SET diagnostics' ELIDED RECEIVERS (kb/Work PB388's last half).
/// <para>Every receiving brace in ISO §14.9.39.2 is printed <c>{ … } …</c>, so every SET diagnostic about a
/// receiver is about a LIST — and the binder has that list in hand at the moment it reports. Thirteen message
/// strings opened <c>SET …</c> anyway, and the diagnostic renderer transliterates U+2026 to ASCII, so what the
/// programmer actually read was <c>SET . TO SELF</c>: a statement nobody wrote, naming neither the operands
/// they wrote nor (the <c>SELF/SUPER</c> arms) the sender they wrote. Measured on this tree before the repair:
/// <c>SET P1 P2 TO SELF</c> over two <c>USAGE POINTER</c> items printed
/// <c>COBOLNET0869: SET … TO SELF/SUPER: …</c>.</para>
/// <para>⛔ THE REPAIR IS STRUCTURAL, SO THE TEST IS STRUCTURAL. Nine call sites had each written their own
/// <c>string.Join(' ', refs.Select(r =&gt; $"'{r.GetText()}'"))</c> while five siblings holding the same list
/// wrote <c>…</c> instead; the naming now has ONE home, <c>SetFormatSelection.Written</c>, which is what a new
/// arm reaches for. Both halves are asserted: no <b>message</b> may OPEN with an elided SET, and no file may
/// carry a second copy of the naming idiom. A form REFERENCE — "the receiving operand of <c>SET … TO ENTRY</c>
/// shall be USAGE PROGRAM-POINTER" — is the general format's own ellipsis and is deliberately untouched: it
/// appears mid-sentence, never at the head of the message, which is what the head-anchored pattern keys on.</para>
/// <para>Proven to FAIL before it was trusted: <see cref="ThePatternThisTestKeysOn_FiresOnThePB388Defect"/>
/// feeds the matcher the exact line the tree carried and asserts it is caught, and feeds it the repaired twin
/// and asserts it is not (feedback_green_gates_arent_evidence — a gate that has never been seen to fail is not
/// evidence). The behavioural half lives in the negative goldens
