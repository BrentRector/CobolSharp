///
/// <para>GR2 reads "During the execution of a USE procedure, if a statement raises an exception condition that
/// would cause the execution of a USE procedure that had previously been activated and had not yet returned
/// control to the activating entity, the EC-FLOW-USE exception condition is set to exist." The compiler had the
/// consequence and not the condition: the generated <c>__RunUse</c> returned quietly on its re-entrancy guard
/// and EC-FLOW-USE appeared nowhere outside <c>ExceptionCatalog</c>, so a program could not detect its own
/// declarative recursion and the §14.6.13.1.6 Table 13 Fatal default could never fire.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why a test class and not one golden.</b> The fix lives at the ONE place that knows the guard fired,
/// and SIX generated selection paths reach it — <c>__IoCheck</c> (format-1, I-O-status driven), <c>__IoCheckEc</c>
/// (the EC-model I-O bridge), <c>__EcDispatch</c> (format 3), <c>__EcObjDispatch</c> (format 4),
/// <c>__RunGlobalUse</c> (the §14.9.49.4 GR4 b outward GLOBAL walk) and the report engine's BEFORE REPORTING
/// hook. This repo's most reproducible defect is a dispatch with two arms and one of them fixed, so the arms
/// that are separately GENERATED are separately pinned here, together with the two outcomes a positive golden
/// cannot carry (the §14.6.13.1.3 #7 abnormal termination, and the checking-off zero-scaffolding invariant) and
/// the ONE id distinction the raise site has to make: the exception-checking PERFORM's imp-2/3/4 handler ranges
/// share <c>__RunUse</c> and its guard array but are NOT USE procedures (§14.9.28.4 GR17, not §14.9.49.4 GR3),
