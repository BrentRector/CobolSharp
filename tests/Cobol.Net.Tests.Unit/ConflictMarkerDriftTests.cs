/// script. A broken tool reads exactly like a silent one.
/// <para>
/// Three layers each had a reason not to look: the implementer checkpoint protocol stages with <c>git add -A</c>,
/// which is as happy to stage a conflicted file as a clean one; the lander briefs resolve conflicts by judgement
/// and had no step that re-checked the resolution; and no test read the file. This class is the layer that makes

/// byte-level test over the whole committed tree.
