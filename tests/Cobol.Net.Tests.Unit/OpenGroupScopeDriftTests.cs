/// outer brace pair — verified against the printed page — around the whole group
/// <c>{open-mode} [sharing-phrase] [retry-phrase] {file-name-1 [WITH NO REWIND]} …</c>, carrying its own
/// trailing ellipsis; §14.9.27.4 GR20 then makes the statement equal to "a separate OPEN statement … for each
/// file-name … each hav[ing] the same open mode specification, the sharing-phrase, retry-phrase, and REWIND
/// phrase as specified in the OPEN statement". The open mode in that list is unarguably per group, so the
/// phrases beside it are too.

/// <para>⛔ WHAT THIS GATE EXISTS TO CATCH, AND WHY A CONFORMANCE GOLDEN CANNOT. The defect was a SCALAR
/// standing in for a per-group value: <c>BoundOpen</c> carried <c>SharingOverride</c> and <c>Retry</c> as
/// statement properties, so one group's phrase governed every file — and the next phrase added to the format
/// (the NO REWIND phrase, kb/Work PB317; the per-file-name syntax rules, kb/Work PB318) would have been added
/// the same way, because that was the shape on offer. <c>conformance:2002/pb316_open_group_scope</c> proves the
/// two phrases that exist TODAY are scoped correctly; only a check on the SHAPE makes the next one automatic.
/// The rule enforced here is exact: the statement node carries nothing but its file list, and every per-group
/// value lives on <see cref="BoundOpenFile"/>.</para>
///
/// <para>⛔ <see cref="ThePredicate_ActuallyFails_OnAStatementScopedPhrase"/> is not a formality
/// (<c>feedback_green_gates_arent_evidence</c>): this gate will spend its life green, and a green gate that
/// never looked at anything is indistinguishable from one that works. It drives the same pure function over a
/// fabricated node shaped like the pre-PB316 <c>BoundOpen</c>, and over one shaped like today's, so the failure
