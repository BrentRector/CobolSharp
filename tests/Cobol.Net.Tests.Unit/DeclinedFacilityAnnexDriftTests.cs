/// The drift guard for the DECLINED-FACILITY POSTURE — that every diagnostic which declines a language element

/// user documentation ISO §4.2.6 and §4.2.7 both oblige (<c>docs/CONFORMANCE.md</c>).

/// <para>⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS (kb/Work PB709). §4.2.6 governs Annex A.3, PROCESSOR-DEPENDENT elements, and carries
/// two sentences nothing else in the standard carries — a MANDATORY compile-time warning mechanism, and an express
/// licence not to "diagnose syntax errors within this unsupported syntax". §4.2.7 governs Annex A.4, OPTIONAL
/// elements, and has NEITHER: it makes the element one an implementor "may, but need not, implement" and requires
/// only that the claim be identified in user documentation, after which A.4.1 admits the syntax "only when support
/// for that language element is claimed by the implementor". The two licences reach OPPOSITE postures — accept and
/// warn versus refuse by name — so which clause a decline cites is a normative fact about it, not a reference.
/// §4.2.6 was nevertheless written at four Annex-A.4 sites, and NOTHING could see it: the clause exists, the quoted
/// text is genuinely in the standard, and <c>scripts/spec/audit_code_citations.py --check</c> therefore passes. A
/// real citation answering a different question is invisible to every mechanical check the repo had.</para>

/// annex is now DATA on the descriptor (<see cref="DiagnosticDescriptor.Annex"/>) and the licensing clause is
/// DERIVED from it (<see cref="DiagnosticDescriptor.PostureClause"/>), so the next declined facility cannot get it

/// the shape that makes the NEXT case automatic, and pair it with a drift test so it stays true).</para>
