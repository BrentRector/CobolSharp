/// be unwrapped first (and in a SENDING context sliced to §13.18.38.4 GR8's current extent), and an imageless

/// unwrap AND returned the maximum image instead of GR8's current extent (PB178's sibling),
/// <c>OoEmitter.EmitMethod</c> had no arm and no capability guard at all (CS1061 on a method formal group with
/// a POINTER leaf — PB177 arm A), and <c>OperandText.FieldAsString</c> was complete only by luck of three
