/// runtime element if checking for that exception condition is enabled in the activating runtime element" — one
/// element, named twice. The compiler used to fold the <b>callee's</b> own <c>&gt;&gt;TURN</c> state into
/// <c>BoundRaising.Enabled</c> at bind time and branch on it, so a declarative in an activator that had enabled
/// the condition never ran when the callee had it off, and one in an activator that had disabled it ran when the
/// callee had it on. §7.3.25.4 GR6/GR8 scope a directive to the statements "that follow in the compilation
/// group", so the two elements differ inside ONE file and both wrong answers are reachable without separate
/// compilation.</para>

/// <para><b>What is structurally guarded here.</b> Three things the behavioural goldens cannot see.
/// (1) <see cref="BoundRaising"/> carries NO bind-time enablement decision at all — the field's absence is the
/// fix, not a value it happens to hold. (2) Every <see cref="IActivatingStatement"/> really carries and
/// round-trips a profile, so the central stamp at the one <c>BindStatement</c> exit reaches it. (3) The RUNTIME
/// fold and the COMPILE-TIME fold agree for every catalogued level-3 name over every directive shape — they are
/// two readers of §7.3.25.4's expansion, and <c>ExceptionCatalog.DirectiveCovers</c> exists so the expansion is
