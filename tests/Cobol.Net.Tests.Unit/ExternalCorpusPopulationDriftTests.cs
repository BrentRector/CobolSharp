/// <summary>
/// ⛔ THE GATE THAT KEEPS "THE CORPUS" ONE POPULATION — PB209.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The reachability question ("does any program we test against have this shape?") and the external differential
/// gate ("compile all 1,323 of them") used to measure DIFFERENT populations through DIFFERENT readers. The sweep
/// spelled the corpus as <c>find tests/external/gnucobol -name '*.cob'</c>, which finds exactly TWO files,
/// because the 1,323 GnuCOBOL programs live as <c>AT_DATA</c> heredocs inside 36 <c>.at</c> autotest wrappers.
/// Two landing waves therefore shipped new bind-time REJECTIONS on a blast radius stated as empty, and the very
/// next differential found both shapes in the corpus the sweep was named after — one of them in a case titled
/// <i>"REDEFINES: with OCCURS"</i> (§13.18.44.3 SR5 sentence 1 → COBOLNET1701; §13.18.63.3 SR13 sentence 2 →
/// COBOLNET1702).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The structural fix is ONE extractor (<c>scripts/gnucobol_extract.py</c>: <c>differential_cases</c> and
/// <c>iter_programs</c>) shared by <c>scripts/gnucobol_differential.py</c> and <c>scripts/corpus_sweep.py</c>.
/// This class is the "automatic" that keeps it true (CLAUDE.md rule 5): the sweep's external population,
/// recomputed live from the <c>.at</c> wrappers, must equal the differential's COMMITTED per-case baseline. The
/// two sides are produced independently — one read live from the corpus, one written by the gate and committed —
/// so their agreement is evidence rather than a tautology. If either reader stops seeing the corpus, this is red.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ <see cref="TheDriftCheck_ActuallyFails_WhenTheExtractionIsEmptied"/> is not a formality
/// (<c>feedback_green_gates_arent_evidence</c>). A check observed only passing is indistinguishable from one
/// that inspects nothing — and "inspects nothing, reports a clean zero" is exactly the defect being closed. It
/// drives the same instrument against an emptied extraction and requires it to go red AND to refuse to report
/// hit counts.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The sweep is a Python instrument, so this gate runs it. A missing interpreter is a LOUD failure and not a
/// skip: every gate in this repo already depends on Python, and a silent green from a check that never ran is
/// the failure mode under repair (<c>feedback_verdict_evidence_invariant</c>).
