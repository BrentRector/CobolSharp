/// clause: <c>reportSourceClause</c> took <c>dataReference+</c> and <c>sumOperand</c> was
/// <c>dataReference (OF reportName)?</c>, so <c>SOURCE IS (A + B)</c>, <c>SOURCE IS A ROUNDED</c> and
/// <c>SUM A + 1</c> were all raw parse errors on conforming source, and §13.18.53.3 SR3/SR5/SR7, §13.18.54.3
/// SR3/SR6 and §13.18.53.4 GR2's implicit COMPUTE had no reachable population at all.</para>

/// <para><b>The invariant.</b> ONE production — <c>reportValueOperand</c> — is referenced by BOTH clauses, and
/// the ROUNDED phrase each carries is the SHARED <c>roundedPhrase</c> of §14.7.4, never a report-local copy.
/// The sharing is what makes the 2014 <c>MODE IS</c> introduction gate reach a report clause at all (the pass
/// fires on RECOGNITION of <c>roundedPhrase</c>, wherever it appears), and it is what stops the next operand
/// form from being added to one clause and forgotten in the other — this repo's most reproducible defect shape.
/// The FORM decision likewise lives in ONE classifier, <c>DataBinder.Reports.BareReferenceOf</c>.</para>
///
/// <para>⭐ IT READS THE GRAMMAR, NOT A REMEMBERED SHAPE: the assertions are regexes over
