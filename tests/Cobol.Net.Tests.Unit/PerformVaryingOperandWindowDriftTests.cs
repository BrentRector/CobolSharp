/// <summary>
/// kb/Work PB437 — the EVALUATION WINDOW of every PERFORM VARYING operand slot, pinned per slot.
///
/// <para><b>The rule.</b> ISO §14.9.28.4 GR12 states it as one sentence: "Item identification for identifier-3,
/// identifier-4, identifier-6, identifier-7, index-name-2, and index-name-4 is done each time the content of the
/// data item referenced by the identifier or the index referenced by the index-name is used in a SETTING or
/// AUGMENTING operation." So every FROM and every BY is re-read at each such operation — and a FUNCTION
/// reference in one activates at each such operation (§8.4.3.2.4 GR1/GR6a: the value "is determined when the
/// function is referenced at runtime"). The FIRST level's FROM is the one slot whose setting operation happens
/// exactly ONCE per execution of the statement (GR13 a) for TEST BEFORE, GR13 b) for TEST AFTER, both of which
/// initialize it before any transfer of control and never again), which is the only window a statement-scoped
/// hoist is EXACT for.
///
/// <para><b>Why a drift test and not only the goldens.</b> The two per-evaluation slots are covered by runtime
/// cardinality in <c>tests/conformance/2023/pb437_varying_operand_windows.cob</c>, but the FIRST-level FROM's
/// window is not observable from a program's output at all: GR13 uses that operand once whichever window it
/// carries, so only the activation COUNT differs, and only a side-effecting function could see it. The window
/// table is therefore pinned HERE, over the generated C#, where "before the loop" and "inside the loop" are
/// directly measurable. Before PB437 the two per-evaluation slots had no window — they had a REFUSAL
/// (COBOLNET1509, on source the standard admits).</para>
///
/// <para><b>What is measured.</b> Each program carries exactly ONE function reference, in one operand slot,
/// written as a table SUBSCRIPT so it registers a §15.4 temporary store as a pre-op — the same pending list a
/// user-function activation uses, because §8.8.4.13 r2 governs "functions" and not one spelling of them. The
/// generated C# is then asked where that store landed relative to the varying phrase's own loop header.</para>
