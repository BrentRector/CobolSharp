/// ⛔ A UTF-8 BOM ON A `.g4` FILE BREAKS THE ANTLR BUILD, AND IT BROKE CI WHILE EVERY LOCAL GATE STAYED GREEN.
/// A tool edit wrote <c>CobolLexer.g4</c> with Python's <c>utf-8-sig</c> encoding — which PREPENDS a byte-order
/// mark on write — and the grammar compiler answered
/// <c>error(50): CobolLexer.g4:1:0: syntax error: '∩' came as a complete surprise to me</c>
/// (the BOM's three bytes rendered through a single-byte code page). The Windows Release job failed on
/// "Build (Release, warnings-as-errors)"; the Linux jobs and every local build passed, because the local
/// incremental build had already produced the generated parser and never re-ran the grammar compiler on the
/// changed file the way a clean checkout does.
/// <para>
/// So this guard exists because the failure is INVISIBLE to the fast feedback loop by construction: the file
/// still reads correctly in every editor, the diff shows nothing, and the compiler only objects on a cold
/// build. It is a byte-level fact, so it needs a byte-level test.
/// </para>

/// ⚠ Scoped to the file types where a BOM is actually FATAL or against the repo's convention. C# tolerates a
/// BOM — Roslyn strips it — but the repo is overwhelmingly BOM-less, and a stray one is the fingerprint of

/// would be listed here with a reason; none does today.
