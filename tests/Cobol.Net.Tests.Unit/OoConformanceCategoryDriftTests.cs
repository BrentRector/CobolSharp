/// switched on the formal's category with arms for object-reference, numeric and alphanumeric and a
/// <c>default:</c> that answered "formal category {c} is not yet carried across INVOKE". So a category-boolean,
/// category-national, numeric-edited, pointer or program-pointer FORMAL PARAMETER was impossible in every
/// passing mode — BY REFERENCE, BY CONTENT and bare alike — while the marshaling arms had carried all of them
/// the whole time.
/// <para>The failure was invisible to every gate because a "not yet carried" message READS like a deliberate
/// staging decision (feedback_green_test_can_hold_a_gap_open). Nothing was staged: §14.8.2.3.2 states one rule
/// for every category, and its own lettered exceptions b and c pair a BIT GROUP and a NATIONAL GROUP with the
/// matching elementary items — the standard contemplates exactly the categories the default arm refused.</para>
