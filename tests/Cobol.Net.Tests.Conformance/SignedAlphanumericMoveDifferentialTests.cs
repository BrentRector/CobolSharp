    // elementary RECEIVER), so it is "treated as an alphanumeric to alphanumeric elementary move, EXCEPT that there is
    // no conversion of data from one form of internal representation to another" (spec line 28569). GR6a's operational-
    // sign drop is scoped to GR6's "valid elementary moves" (line 28573/28586) and therefore does NOT apply — dropping
    // an overpunch (byte 'N' → '5') is exactly the representation conversion GR4 bars. So S9(3) -45 copies its DISPLAY
    // overpunch image verbatim → "04N". CORRECTED 2026-07-22 (CA28, DEVLOG 998): this test previously pinned "045" on a
    // MISREAD — it applied §8.8.4.1 (a RELATION-CONDITION rule, "a group compares as elementary alphanumeric") to MOVE,
    // where §14.9.25.4 GR4 governs. The legacy oracle's "04N" (once mislabelled non-conformant) is in fact the
