/// GR3 a)/GR5 (file-name scope) and GR3 b)/GR6 b)–e) (open-mode scope) — are the SAME at 85, 2002, 2014 and
/// 2023, so the generated selector must be TEXTUALLY IDENTICAL at all four (kb/Work PB344).
///
/// <para><b>Why this test exists.</b> Annex E.2 item 19 a)/b) reads as if the open-mode tier were a 2023
/// change, and it was once implemented as a <c>&lt;=2014</c> guard. It is not one: Annex E is INFORMATIVE,
/// §E.1 scopes it to "a list of the substantive changes between the previous COBOL standard and this Working
/// Draft International Standard" — ONE prior edition, so it says nothing about 1985 or 2002 — and item 19's
/// own justification classes the prior state as defective TEXT, "The previous COBOL Standard was not clear or
/// missing processing of some I-O exceptions", each sub-item adding "This appears to be an error in previous
/// standards". A silence is not a prohibition, and for 1985 the behaviour is fixed the OTHER way by that
/// edition's own validation suite: the guard turned five NIST CCVS programs RED on CI (SQ122A, SQ136A, SQ137A,
/// SQ138A, SQ148A — SQ137A's own remark is "INPUT DECLARATIVE NOT EXECUTED").</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why it is not a golden.</b> The tier pair is rendered by THREE selectors —
/// <c>DispatchEmitter.__IoCheck</c>, <c>EcEmitter.__IoCheckEc</c> and the §14.9.49.4 GR4 b) outward GLOBAL
/// walk <c>ProgramEmitter.__RunGlobalUse</c> — and only the first two are reachable from an observable output
/// difference in a single program. Comparing the EMITTED TEXT covers all three at once, and it fails on the
/// re-introduction of ANY per-edition condition, in any of them, whether or not a golden happens to exercise
/// that arm. The complement is asserted too: a run in which a selector was never emitted FAILS, so the test
