/// <summary>
/// THE witnesses for the <c>DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT</c> traceability rows whose facility is ACCEPT-INERT — the
/// half of that verdict that is easy to skip. <c>tests/version-matrix/inventory-schema.json</c> is explicit:
/// "The notes field carries the decision reference; closing still needs a test proving we <b>diagnose</b> (or,
/// where the departure is a reported VALUE rather than a rejected construct, that the documented behaviour is
/// what actually happens) rather than silently miscompile." A declined facility a program can still write and
/// get a clean, silent compile out of is not declined — it is undiagnosed, and nothing else in the battery can
/// tell those apart.
///
/// <para>⛔ WHY THESE ARE NOT GOLDENS. The facilities left in this class are declined <b>ACCEPT-INERT</b>, so
/// their named diagnostics are <b>warnings</b> (COBOLNET1578-1580, docs/CONFORMANCE.md §1): the positive corpus
/// asserts a program COMPILES and byte-matches its <c>.out</c> and never looks at the warning channel, and the
/// negative corpus requires the compile to FAIL, which a warning does not. So a corpus golden can pin the
/// INERTNESS half and only a compile-diagnostic assertion can pin the DECLINE half. Each test below therefore
/// reads the SAME source the corpus runs — one source of truth for both halves — and adds the assertion the
/// corpus structurally cannot make. (feedback_green_test_can_hold_a_gap_open: a warning nothing asserts reads
/// as implemented support.)</para>
///
/// <para>⛔ SCREEN HANDLING (Annex A.4.2) IS NO LONGER WITNESSED HERE, and its absence is the point. It used to
/// be the largest client of this class, pinned as an accept-inert WARNING. kb/Work PB260 measured that posture
/// and refuted it: A.4.1 — "An implementation shall accept the syntax and provide the functionality for an
/// optional element only when support for that language element is claimed by the implementor" — is a
/// prohibition on ACCEPTING, so an unclaimed A.4 module is REFUSED, not warned. The whole module is now an
/// ERROR by name (COBOLNET1560 data/environment surface, COBOLNET1707 procedure surface) through the one funnel
/// <see cref="CobolNet.Binding.ScreenFacility"/>, which puts its witnesses where a refusal belongs: the NEGATIVE
/// corpus, 41 programs under <c>tests/conformance/negative/a42-*</c>, each <c>.err</c> naming the construct as
/// well as the code. <c>ScreenFacilityConstructDriftTests</c> holds that coverage complete against
/// <c>CobolScreen.g4</c>. Adding a screen test back here would need it to COMPILE, which is exactly what the
/// module may no longer do.</para>
///
/// <para>THE SPEC BASIS, per remaining facility. Commit/rollback is PROCESSOR-DEPENDENT (Annex A.3 item 6) and
/// §4.2.6 third paragraph makes the compile-time warning mechanism MANDATORY for one that is not supported, so
/// the COBOLNET1579 assertion is a conformance obligation, not a house style. VALIDATE (Annex A.4.14) is
/// OPTIONAL and additionally OBSOLETE (§4.2.13; Annex F.2 item 5): §4.2.7 requires only that the decline be
/// identified in user documentation, so COBOLNET1580 is this implementation's own stronger posture — and a
/// posture that is documented but unmeasured is exactly what these rows owe. kb/Work PB261 owns the
/// commit/rollback debt. Asynchronous messaging (Annex A.3 item 4) and the OPTIONS FLOAT-DECIMAL clause (A.3
/// item 13) are processor-dependent too, so their warnings (COBOLNET1578, COBOLNET2424) are §4.2.6 ¶3
/// obligations; kb/Work R43 made the rows conditioned solely on them derived verdicts that these facts witness.</para>
