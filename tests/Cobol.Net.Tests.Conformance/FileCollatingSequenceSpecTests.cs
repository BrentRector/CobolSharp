/// BRACE GROUP, and no rule adds a distinctness requirement to the repetition. So one clause may list the same
/// key twice, and one clause is never "more than one" — the rule counts CLAUSES, not occurrences.</para>

/// <c>COLLATING SEQUENCE OF IX-KEY IX-KEY IS REV</c> with a diagnostic the program itself falsified. A
