/// (<c>CorpusRunnerTests.EnabledNegativeCase_RejectsWithItsDiagnostic</c> asserts <c>ok == false</c> and matches
/// the <c>.err</c> code), and the positive corpus compares STDOUT only — the fixture header of
/// <c>2023/wave_h_facilities_inert.cob</c> says in so many words that the warnings "go to the non-failing
/// compile channel (not stdout)". So COBOLNET1560 / 1578 / 1579 / 1580 had **no assertion mechanism of any
/// kind**: a repository-wide search found the four codes only inside SOURCE COMMENTS. Every one of them could
/// have stopped firing and nothing would have gone red (feedback_green_gates_arent_evidence;
/// feedback_reachability_is_measured_not_deduced). <c>EditionHarness.CompileFull</c> returns the warning channel,
/// which is the seam these facts use.</para>
///
/// <para>The A.4 DATA-DIVISION halves need none of this: COBOLNET1708/1709/1710 are ERRORS (Annex A.4.1 — an
