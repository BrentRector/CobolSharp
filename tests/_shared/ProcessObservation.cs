/// ⛔ WHY THIS TYPE EXISTS (plan §11 A12; DESIGN-test-build-ci.md §3.10). Six separate copies of "start
/// <c>dotnet</c>, wait 30 seconds, return whatever came back" existed across the test tree
/// (<c>CutRunner.RunExit</c>, <c>AcceptDifferentialTests.AcceptRun</c>, <c>CobolNetTestBase.CompileAndRun</c>,
/// and three in the legacy <c>EndToEndTestBase</c>). Every one of them handled a timeout the same wrong way:
/// kill the process, return <i>partial or empty stdout</i>, and let the caller compare it against a golden.
/// A contention timeout therefore reported as a VALUE MISMATCH — indistinguishable from a semantic
/// regression. That is the mechanism behind the observation §11 A12 was opened for: two full Conformance runs
/// on an IDENTICAL tree returned 4159/4160 then 4160/4160, and the named test passed in isolation.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The fix is not a longer timeout — it is refusing to manufacture a value out of a run that never finished.
/// A process that timed out, was killed, or failed to launch produced NO OBSERVATION, and this type raises
/// <see cref="HarnessNonObservationException"/> rather than hand a caller something to compare. No assertion
/// anywhere can mistake that for a wrong answer, whatever it chose to assert on.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚖ ON THE RETRY. <see cref="ObserveOrThrow"/> re-attempts once before giving up, and that is NOT re-rolling
/// a failed assertion — it is re-attempting a MEASUREMENT THAT DID NOT COMPLETE. Nothing about the compiler
/// was learned on the first attempt, so there is no result being discarded. The retry is serialized behind
/// <see cref="RetryGate"/> so it runs with the least contention the run can offer, which is the whole point
/// given that contention is the named cause. Every retry is recorded (see <see cref="LogPath"/>) so the rate
/// is measurable rather than assumed — a silent retry would trade one blind spot for another.
