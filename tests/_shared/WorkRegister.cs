/// YAML shape, which <c>kb/Work/PB205</c> had carried for months — was read by the Python side as a TRUNCATED
/// list and by the gate's own private parser (<c>value.StartsWith('[') &amp;&amp; value.EndsWith(']')</c>, else
/// <c>[]</c>) as NO LIST AT ALL. So a note claimed four inventory rows in the register while the gate that
/// enforces claims saw none, and <c>work.py check</c> called the same note well-formed. Measured on the live
/// register the day this reader replaced it: of 939 notes, exactly one parsed differently — PB205, from 4 rows
/// to its real 12.

/// that claims nothing. Here a value the grammar cannot finish is an <see cref="Note.Errors"/> CODE and the key
/// is left ABSENT — never silently empty — and the codes are what
/// <c>tests/version-matrix/work-frontmatter-parity-cases.json</c> compares, because two readers that reject one
