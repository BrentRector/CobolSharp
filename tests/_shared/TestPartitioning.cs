/// <summary>
/// THE mechanism for running one theory-heavy test class across SEVERAL xUnit collections — one rule, one place.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS (plan §11 A13, measured). xUnit <b>2.9.2 parallelizes at TEST-COLLECTION granularity, and by
/// default each test CLASS is one collection</b> — so every test in a class, including every row of a
/// <c>[Theory]</c>, runs <b>SERIALLY ON ONE THREAD</b>. A single fat class therefore caps an entire assembly's wall
/// clock while the other cores idle, and nothing in the normal output says so. Measured on the battery #41 trx
/// (2026-09-01, 32-core box, <c>scripts/profile-test-parallelism.py</c>): the Conformance assembly ran 5,241 tests
/// in <b>721 s wall for 1,948 s of test time — 2.7x average concurrency</b>, of which
/// <c>VersionMatrixTests</c> alone was <b>2,127 tests running serially for 720.5 s</b>, i.e. essentially the WHOLE
/// leg was one class on one thread; the Unit assembly was <b>171 s wall / 329 s test time — 1.9x</b>, and one class
/// (<c>StorageFormEquivalenceTests</c>' NIST sweep, 171.5 s) <i>was</i> that wall clock.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⭐ THE SHAPE, and why it is this one. xUnit v2 offers exactly two levers — genuine class splits, or
/// <c>[Collection]</c> attributes — and <c>[Collection]</c> only ever <i>merges</i> classes into a shared
/// collection, so it cannot split one. That leaves class splits, and the naive form of a class split DUPLICATES
/// THE TEST BODIES, which is how a split silently rots. So: the tests live ONCE in an <b>abstract generic base</b>
/// <c>Family&lt;TSlot&gt;</c>, its <c>[MemberData]</c> sources slice the family's full row set with
/// <see cref="SliceRows{TSlot}"/>, and each partition is a <b>one-line</b> concrete class
/// <c>sealed class Family_P3 : FamilyBase&lt;Slot3&gt;;</c>. Every concrete class is its own default collection, so
/// the partitions run concurrently.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This works because <b>static members of a CLOSED generic type are per-type-argument</b>, and xUnit resolves
/// <c>[MemberData]</c> against <c>testMethod.DeclaringType</c> — which for a method inherited from
/// <c>FamilyBase&lt;Slot3&gt;</c> is the <i>closed</i> <c>FamilyBase&lt;Slot3&gt;</c>, not the open definition. That
/// is not assumed: it was proved on xunit 2.9.2 / xunit.runner.visualstudio 2.8.2 with a standalone probe (3
/// partitions over 9 rows produced 9 tests, 3 per partition, each asserting its OWN slot — an open-type resolution
/// would have produced 27 tests and 18 failures).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ THE INVARIANT THAT MATTERS is that the partitions cover the family's row set <b>exactly once</b> — a family
/// whose partition classes go stale (one deleted, one duplicated, the count bumped without a new class) drops rows
/// SILENTLY and stays green. <see cref="TestPartitionAudit"/> is the drift gate that makes that impossible, and it
/// is generic: it discovers every family in an assembly by shape, so a NEW partitioned family is covered the
/// moment it is written, with no registration step.
