// A transcription defect matters twice. The markdown is wrong (a section-C repair), AND the grammar may have been
// BUILT from the wrong diagram — in which case the compiler rejects legal COBOL and it is a section-B fix-queue
// bug. Proven on GOBACK: the figure lost its choice-indicator bars, the grammar encodes
// `(raisingPhrase | statusPhrase)?` with a comment calling them "mutually-exclusive", and
// `GOBACK RAISING ... WITH NORMAL STATUS` is rejected with "no viable alternative at input 'WITH'".
// This has bitten before: CobolParserCore.g4:773 records the same inheritance for ON SIZE ERROR, fixed 2026-07-19.
