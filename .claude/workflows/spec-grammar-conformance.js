// WHY THIS EXISTS, in the owner's words: "Given multiple transcription errors, I think every syntax diagram
// and/or narrative of a syntax should be one-by-one verified against the grammar."
//
// The grammar was written from a transcription now known to lose information — always toward FALSELY RESTRICTIVE
// syntax. Checking only the pages where a transcription defect was FOUND is not enough: a defect the reconciliation
// sweep missed is still in the grammar, and a grammar rule can diverge from a correctly-transcribed figure for
// reasons of its own. So the unit of work is every general format (321 sections / 432 numbered Formats) and every
// syntax rule (1,338) — 1,659 items — checked against the PRINTED PAGE, not against the markdown.
//
// Proven necessary: GOBACK. The figure carries choice-indicator bars (both phrases legal); the grammar encodes
// `(raisingPhrase | statusPhrase)?` and rejects `GOBACK RAISING ... WITH NORMAL STATUS` with
// "no viable alternative at input 'WITH'". The same inheritance hit ON SIZE ERROR once already.
