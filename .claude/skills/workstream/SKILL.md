# Workstream — token-frugal, restart-safe orchestration

> ⛔ **Owner standing instruction (2026-09-02).** Twenty-eight concurrent Opus agents burned ~20% of a session window
> in eleven minutes; ~fifty exhausted a window in ~2.5 h; two cutoffs in one day (the reset hour is NOT fixed — read it
> off the 429). A RESUMED long transcript re-reads its whole context on every turn, so resuming eight 300-turn

> "Run all this work so that we don't repeat effort when hitting a limit and resuming."

The orchestrator (the session model) dispatches, reconciles, gates and commits; every other job — probe, implement,
validate, adversarial review, land — is a subagent on the model `~/.claude/settings.json` names (`claude-opus-5`),
passed explicitly as `model: 'opus'`.

## 1. Checkpoint to disk, never to a transcript

| job | checkpoint | resume unit |
|---|---|---|
| implementer (worktree) | `git commit -m "WIP checkpoint: …"` on the worktree branch **after every mechanism and every gate**, plus `<worktree>/STATUS.md` with `DONE` (per mechanism) · `NEXT` (the exact next step) · `BLOCKED` · `GATE` (last verdict lines + filter) · batch-file path · codes used | one mechanism |
| workflow stage (adjudicate / refute / write / validate) | one JSON line per rule (or draft) appended to `<out>/<stage>-<slug>.jsonl` the moment it is decided; read-and-skip on start; the stage's whole result also written to `<out>/out-<slug>.json` | one rule |
| lander | a commit in ITS worktree after each numbered step + `STATUS.md` | one step |
| orchestrator | reports are FILES under the scratchpad (`reports/<cluster>-report.md`), briefs are FILES referenced by path; the conversation carries only pointers | — |

**A killed agent is replaced by a FRESH agent that reads the checkpoint** (`STATUS.md` + `git log`, or the `.jsonl`).
Resume via `SendMessage` only when the agent is within a step of finishing. A workflow resumes with `resumeFromRunId`,
but design its stages to read inputs from disk (`out-<slug>.json`) so a rewritten script never re-runs completed work.

## 2. The cost law, the turn caps, and the concurrency budget

⛔ **The reason is measured, not anecdotal.** An agent's token cost is QUADRATIC in its turn count:

> **`tokens ≈ 0.115·T + 0.00031·T²`**  — fitted over **n = 239 agents**, refitted independently to
> `0.1154·T + 0.000309·T²`. ⓜ **18 of those 239 ran ≥ 250 turns and burned 39 % of all 5.62 B tokens**; re-modelled
> at a 150-turn cap the same turns cost **45 % less**.
> (`docs/rearchitecture/evidence/PROCESS-REVIEW-2026-09-04.md`; the decisions on it are `kb/Work/PB468`.)

Everything below follows from that curve. A long transcript is not "a bit more expensive" — it is the single
largest line item in the burn-down.

**Hard turn caps (owner decision, 2026-09-04).**

| agent | cap | at the cap |
|---|---|---|
| any read-only agent — adjudicator, refuter, validator, probe, reviewer | **160 turns** | checkpoint, return what is decided, name what is not |
| implementer | **220 turns** | checkpoint, write `STATUS.md` `NEXT`, return a report headed `SPLIT` |

⛔ **A job that will not fit is SPLIT, never extended.** A fresh agent starting from the checkpoint is on the flat
part of the curve; the killed one's continuation is on the steep part.

**One mechanism per implementer.** ⓜ A mechanism costs ~150 turns and an implementer's fixed cost is only ~70, so
the quadratic eats the amortization immediately: the **second mechanism in one transcript costs 44.6 M, more than
a whole fresh implementer at 40.3 M**. Two only when the notes share one code site *and* one gate filter — in
which case the register's own clustering rule says they were one mechanism to begin with.

**One landing per lander transcript.** ⓜ lander-3 carried 4 landings in 794 turns for **295.9 M**; the same turns
split into four fresh ~198-turn landers model at **140 M — 53 % less**. (What a lander may batch is *clusters
inside one landing* — §3.)

**The budget: 1 lander + ≤6 implementers + one 4-wide read-only chunk (≈11 agents).** ⭐ The implementer cap was
**raised from 3 to 6 by owner decision on 2026-09-05** (`kb/Work/PB468` Q4), on the measurement that the 3-slot lane ran
at ~100 % utilization all morning while the lander sat idle half the time (≈48 min per implementer, ≈33 min per
four-cluster landing); six implementers saturate one lander with five- or six-cluster trains, which is the band above.
⛔ **Fill the six slots ONE ITEM PER SUBSYSTEM** (the top of `work.py next` for each of binding, codegen, frontend/grammar,
runtime, io …), never six items down the rank list: twelve consecutive file-I/O clusters on 2026-09-05 forced serial
branches, a six-conflict mid-flight merge (~70 turns) and measured-overlap manifests for every train. It is an
error-containment cap, and ⓜ it is TOKENS, not slots, that the weekly limit rations — so the budget is a default,
while the caps above are what actually control spend. Workflows take `concurrency`/`refuteConcurrency` args and run
chunks with `parallel()` inside a loop, never a 16-wide `pipeline`. A fleet over ~40 agents is the signal to SPLIT
the work, not to wait. Stage the earliest-stage, largest jobs behind the near-done ones.

## 3. Landing order and mechanics

- **Land finished work first**; read-only fleets are staged behind landings. **One lander on main at a time** (DEVLOG
  numbering and fast-forward ordering); **one LANDING per lander transcript** (§2) — split the queue into fresh agents.
- ⭐ **FIVE CLUSTERS PER LANDING (target 5; 4–6 is the band).** A landing is ~90 % fixed cost — bring the work in,
  build, gate, DEVLOG, commit, push — so ⓜ **10.4 M per cluster at k = 1 against 5.1 M at k = 5**, and 4.0 minutes
  of lander per cluster against 9.8. The corpus proves it directly: the golden lander landed 151 rows for 52.9 M =
  0.35 M/row; the PB383 lander landed 2 rows for 7.2 M = 3.6 M/row — **10×**. Mechanics: bring in each implementer's
  diff in turn, **one build**, the **union** of their gate filters, **one commit per cluster inside the landing** so
  a red bisects by cluster, one DEVLOG entry naming every cluster, one push. Past six clusters the token curve is
  flat and the gate-attribution risk is not. Template: `templates/lander-train-brief.md`.
- ⛔ **Never spend a lander on a 1–2 cluster landing** unless nothing else is ready — that is the k = 1 corner of the
  table above, at twice the cost per cluster. If only one cluster is finished, hold it and dispatch the lander when
  the train is full; a blocking fix is the exception and is landed alone on purpose, said so in the report.
- ⭐ **A free implementer slot is filled within the TURN it frees**, from `python scripts/spec/work.py next` — never
  at the next convenient moment. ⓜ The fix lane ran at **under 15 % utilization** of the ≤3 cap for six days
  (~2.7 mechanisms/day delivered against ~24/day of capacity) purely because slots sat empty behind landings and
  behind the evidence lane. Keep a standing queue of apply-ready contracts so the dispatch is one turn.
- A worktree-isolated agent cannot run git against the shared checkout (the harness refuses `-C`, `cd`, EnterWorktree):
  landers gate in THEIR worktree, then `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main && git push origin HEAD:main`
  (fast-forward, never `--force`); the orchestrator runs `git merge --ff-only origin/main` locally and removes dead
  worktrees itself (`git worktree remove --force`, `git branch -D`).
- Verdict batches are RE-APPLIED on the merged tree (`record_verdicts.py`), never merged as inventory JSON hunks.
- ⛔ A checkpoint file never enters a landing: every landing `git add` excludes it —
  `git add -A -- . ":!.claude/settings.local.json" ":!STATUS.md"` — and a lander that rebases onto a main that
  already carries a stray `STATUS.md` removes it (`git rm --cached STATUS.md`) in its commit. (2026-09-02: lander 3's
  checkpoint reached main inside a landing, and the next lander's rebase then had to choose between two agents'
  checkpoints for one path.)
- Read-only fleets probe a **pinned worktree with its own built compiler** (`git worktree add --detach <path> <sha>`,
  build there once) so no landing swaps a binary under them.
- One comprehensive battery per landing batch, run by the orchestrator when no fleet is live — ⭐ **in a WORKTREE cut
  at the batch head**, never on main. Its phase 2 (`guard-fast`) REBUILDS, so a battery on main freezes the lander
  for ⓜ ~45 min ≈ 1.5 landings ≈ 7 clusters; run it in a detached worktree at the batch's head commit and that cost
  is zero. The cadence does not change — ⓜ a bisect over N landings costs ⌈log₂N⌉ battery runs, and neither of the
  last two non-green batteries needed one (both reds were attributed by inspection).
- **The owner's ledger artifact is refreshed after EVERY landing that moves GAP / DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT / the
  actionable count, and at every battery close** (owner reminder 2026-09-02): `python scripts/spec/gen_ledger.py
  --out <html> --in-flight <md>` then an `Artifact` publish to the existing URL (recorded in the orchestrator's memory
  `conformance-ledger-artifact`). Numbers are computed by the generator, never typed; only the in-flight narrative is
  hand-written.
- `python scripts/semgrep/verify.py` has a recorded red baseline (`kb/Work/PB175`): a landing must not INCREASE it.

## 4. Central allocation

The orchestrator allocates `kb/Work` ids and diagnostic-code ranges in the dispatch brief; agents never pick their own
(five collisions in one day each cost a renumbering pass). DEVLOG numbers are read from the file at landing time
(top entry + 1). `session-probe` reports the next free diagnostic code — it must end above ALL codes claimed by
in-flight worktrees.

## 5. On restart after a cutoff

1. Read the reset time off the 429 message; check `date` against it.
2. `git status` on main — a dead lander may have applied its patch (finish from the NEXT step; never re-apply).
3. `git worktree list` + dirt per worktree (`git -C <wt> status --short -- . ':!.claude/settings.local.json'`) +
   `STATUS.md` per worktree → who is near done.
4. Dispatch FRESH agents from checkpoints in landing order; resume in place only the near-done ones.

## 6. Templates (substitute the session's paths for `{SCRATCH}`, `{PIN}`)

`templates/` beside this file: `implementer-brief.md` · `lander-brief.md` (ONE cluster) ·
**`lander-train-brief.md` (the five-cluster train — the default when more than two clusters are ready)** ·
`golden-lander-brief.md` · `registrar-brief.md` · `wf_lane3_adjudicate.js` · `wf_lane3_refute.js` ·
`wf_lane1_draft.js` · `wf_lane1_validate.js` · `merge_batch.py` · `build_lane1_inputs.py`. Each carries the
checkpoint protocol and its turn cap already; dispatch by pointing the agent at the file plus the substitutions,
never by pasting the brief into the prompt.
