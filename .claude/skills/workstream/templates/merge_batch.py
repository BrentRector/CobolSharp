"""Lane 3 merge — turn one batch's adjudications + refutations on disk into a record_verdicts batch and a findings digest.

    python merge_batch.py <out-dir> <batch-label>

Reads out-<slug>.json (adjudicator results; falls back to adjudicate-<slug>.jsonl checkpoints), refute-<slug>.jsonl
(refuter checkpoints: one verdict per line). A CONFORMS record whose file has NO refuter checkpoint is DOWNGRADED to
'unrefuted' and EXCLUDED from the batch — the doctrine is that only a refuted closing verdict is recorded. Refuted rows
take the refuter's corrected verdict with the reason appended to notes. Defective verdicts (PARTIAL / NOT-IMPLEMENTED /
DIVERGES) need a register note in `notes` before record_verdicts accepts them — the digest lists the mechanisms so the
note-writer can allocate ids and the notes field is filled in a second pass (this script leaves a `@@NOTE@@` marker).

#: A refuter telling the registrar that the row is NOT this lane's to record — the inventory already
#: carries an OWNER verdict (DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT, D13) and re-recording it would OVERWRITE that
#: verdict with an adjudicator's. Lane-3 batch b3 produced three of these (SR-13.18.63.3-36/-38/-39,
#: all "DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT (unchanged -- the existing inventory row stands; do NOT record
#: CONFORMS)"): the vocabulary scan below would have taken them for PARTIAL and DOWNGRADED a closed
#: owner row. A refuter that names an owner verdict, or that says the existing row stands, EXCLUDES.
OWNER_ROW = re.compile(
    r"(?:DOCUMENTED[- ]NON[- ]SUPPORT"
    r"|\bexisting inventory row stands\b"
    r"|\bdo\s+NOT\s+record\b)", re.I)

#: A refuter telling the registrar to drop the cited evidence. Either order, within one sentence.
TESTREF_CLEARED = re.compile(
    r"(?:test-?ref[^.\n]{0,120}\b(?:WITHDRAWN|CLEARED?|EMPTY)\b"
    r"|\b(?:WITHDRAWN|CLEARED?|EMPTY)\b[^.\n]{0,120}test-?ref)", re.I)

#: ⛔ AN OWNER VERDICT IS NOT AN AGENT'S TO REPLACE — IN EITHER DIRECTION. D13 reserves
#: DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT to the owner, and lane-3 b3's refuters caught three rows where an adjudicator
#: would have overwritten one with CONFORMS. The SAME batch then carried a FOURTH, which no refuter saw
#: because that row was never adjudicated CONFORMS: GR-13.18.63.4-24, DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT → DIVERGES.
#: Downgrading looks harmless — it does not fake a closure — but it still moves the burn-down denominator
#: on an agent's say-so and detaches the row from the notes that own the declined modules (PB260/PB261/
#: PB281-PB283). So the rule is structural, read from the inventory rather than hand-listed: a record whose
#: row ALREADY carries an owner verdict is EXCLUDED and raised as an owner question. The measurement is not
#: lost — it lands as a kb/Work note that claims the row.
