You validate golden DRAFTS for the COBOL.NET compiler (repo E:\\CobolSharp; read CLAUDE.md first). The drafts and
the writer/refuter report for file "${slug}" are under ${SCRATCH}/out/${slug}/ (destination paths mirror the repo:
tests/conformance/<edition>/<name>.cob|.out, tests/conformance/negative/<name>.cob|.err; REPORT.json if a fixer
rewrote the report, else read the writer report in ${SCRATCH}/reports/${slug}.json).
RULES. Do NOT write anything inside E:\\CobolSharp; do NOT run dotnet build/test; do NOT edit any draft .out/.err —
the expected values are SPEC-DERIVED and refuter-upheld; if the compiler disagrees, the compiler is the suspect.
Compiler: E:\\CobolSharp\\.claude\\worktrees\\lane3-pin-5fe593a0\\src\\Cobol.Net.Cli\\bin\\Debug\\net10.0\\cobol.exe (a PINNED build of battery-green tree 5fe593a0 — landings cannot move it under you; never use the main tree's exe).
FOR EACH POSITIVE DRAFT: copy the .cob to a fresh scratch dir under ${SCRATCH}/run/${slug}/<name>/ and run
  cobol.exe <name>.cob --std <edition-from-its-directory> --run
capturing stdout+stderr. Compare stdout to the draft .out: trailing whitespace per line and the final newline are
ignored, CRLF == LF (the corpus runner's rule). Anything else is output-mismatch.
FOR EACH NEGATIVE DRAFT: read its first line "*> reject-at: <years>"; for EACH listed edition run
  cobol.exe <name>.cob --std <year>
and require a non-zero exit AND the .err substring in the diagnostics; also run it at one edition NOT listed (if
any exists in {85,2002,2014,2023}) and record whether it compiles clean there (report only; it is evidence about the
edition band, not a pass/fail criterion unless the rule is edition-limited).
⛔ CHECKPOINT PER DRAFT: your checkpoint file is ${SCRATCH}/validate/${slug}.jsonl — FIRST read it if it exists and skip
every draft file already in it; APPEND one result object (the schema's results item) the moment each draft is judged
(python open(path,'a')); your final return is the union. A session-limit kill can come at any moment.
CLASSIFY every mismatch: re-read the rule text in specs/ISO_COBOL.md yourself; if the draft's expectation follows
from the rule, classification = suspected-compiler-defect with a repro_note (minimal program, rule text quoted,
cite.py --check line, expected vs observed); if you can show the draft misread the rule, classification =
draft-error and say exactly what the rule requires (you still do not edit the draft). Environment problems (missing
exe, timeouts) are 'environment'. Return every draft, including passes.`,
