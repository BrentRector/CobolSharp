You work in the COBOL.NET project. SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR CODE: the PINNED worktree ${PIN} (read-only snapshot; it carries its
OWN built compiler at ${PIN}/src/Cobol.Net.Cli/bin/Debug/net10.0/cobol.exe — use THAT for probes, never the main tree's).
SPEC: E:\\CobolSharp\\specs\\ISO_COBOL.md (ISO/IEC 1989:2023). Read E:\\CobolSharp\\CLAUDE.md first — its eight rules bind you.
You may run python scripts under ${PIN}/scripts (cite.py) and the pinned cobol.exe (scratch programs under ${OUT}/probe/<slug>/).
You MUST NOT run dotnet build/test, git, or write inside any repository tree; write only under ${OUT}.
⛔ CHECKPOINT PER RULE: your checkpoint file is named below. FIRST read it if it exists and SKIP every rule already in it;
then APPEND one JSON line the moment each rule is decided (python open(path,'a'); never rewrite the file). Your final
structured return is the union of the file's lines and your new ones. A session-limit kill can come at any moment; the
file is what survives.
THE SPEC IS THE ONLY ORACLE; NIST/GnuCOBOL/legacy are regression nets. VALIDATE EVERY CITATION with
python ${PIN}/scripts/spec/cite.py --check <clause> "<text>". EDITIONS from the spec, never from the code under review.
CONFORMS COSTS SOMETHING (unlocated => NOT-IMPLEMENTED; an unverified edge => PARTIAL; two halves one verified => PARTIAL).
DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT is never yours (owner, D13; declined modules are owned by PB260/PB261/PB281–PB283 — say so in notes).
ONLY A SPEC-DERIVED TEST CLOSES A ROW (conformance:/unit:/conformance-test: with spec-computed expectations; nist:/
characterization:/*_MatchesLegacy never). CONFORMS-but-untested (empty test-ref) is expected; do not write goldens here.
The dossier is a MAP: its silence is not evidence.`

YOUR INPUT FILE: ${IN}/in-${slug}.json — read it whole (rules, sibling parts, clause map, DOSSIER with grammar/source/
tests/determinations/register notes with status — never re-report a landed fix; reference an open note that already owns
a row — and DIAGNOSTICS rows). YOUR CHECKPOINT FILE: ${OUT}/adjudicate-${slug}.jsonl (one RECORD per line).
Per rule: read the rule text and its general format; locate the code from the dossier and confirm by reading it; verify
across the applicable editions and the adversarial edges the text implies (probe with the pinned cobol.exe when reading
cannot decide); assign the verdict; name an EXISTING spec-derived covering test or leave test-ref empty. Cluster defective
rows by MECHANISM into findings (register-ready paragraph each, with repro + spec-derived expected result); write them to
${OUT}/findings-${slug}.json as you go. When done, write the whole structured result to ${OUT}/out-${slug}.json and return it.`,

You are the INDEPENDENT REFUTER for subject file ${slug}. READ THE ADJUDICATION FROM DISK: ${OUT}/out-${slug}.json (if it
does not exist, read every line of ${OUT}/adjudicate-${slug}.jsonl instead; if neither exists, return zero verdicts and
closing_count_read = 0 — do not invent). Refute ONLY its CONFORMS records — they move the burn-down and are the only ones
dangerous when wrong (a wrong PARTIAL is re-probed at fix time by rule). Every batch so far overturned some of them, always
DOWNWARD; an all-upheld report is a red flag — say what you did to break it. For each: read the rule text yourself FIRST
(${IN}/in-${slug}.json carries it) and derive what the code must do; then read the code at the adjudicator's code-location
in ${PIN}; probe with the pinned cobol.exe when reading cannot decide (edge values, other editions, the operand shapes the
rule names); check the cited test-ref really pins THIS rule's branch and is spec-derived; re-run the citation through
cite.py. Default to refuted when uncertain and name the corrected verdict.
