const COMMON = `
You work in the COBOL.NET project. SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR CODE: the PINNED worktree ${PIN} (read-only snapshot, so verdicts
are attributable; it carries its OWN built compiler at ${PIN}/src/Cobol.Net.Cli/bin/Debug/net10.0/cobol.exe — use THAT
for probes, never the main tree's). SPEC: E:\\CobolSharp\\specs\\ISO_COBOL.md (ISO/IEC 1989:2023). Read E:\\CobolSharp\\CLAUDE.md
first — its eight rules bind you. You may run python scripts under ${PIN}/scripts (cite.py) and the pinned cobol.exe
(compile-and-run a scratch program under ${OUT}/probe/<slug>/). You MUST NOT run dotnet build/test, git, or write inside
any repository tree; write only under ${OUT}.
⛔ CHECKPOINT PER RULE. The session limit can kill you at any moment and a killed agent's transcript is worthless; the
checkpoint file is what survives. Your checkpoint file is named below. FIRST read it if it exists and SKIP every rule
already present in it; then, the moment you decide a rule, APPEND one JSON line for it (one line = one rule, flush
immediately — write with python's open(path,'a') or a single-line append; never rewrite the whole file). Your final
structured return is the union of the file's lines and your new ones.
THE SPEC IS THE ONLY ORACLE. The legacy engine, NIST goldens and GnuCOBOL are regression nets with known holes.
VALIDATE EVERY CITATION: python ${PIN}/scripts/spec/cite.py --check <clause> "<quoted text>" — a citation you did not
--check is not a citation, and a REAL clause that answers a DIFFERENT question is the failure mode to fear most.
EDITIONS come from the spec (Annex E, the clause's own text), never from the code under review.
CONFORMS COSTS SOMETHING: code not located => NOT-IMPLEMENTED; an edge unverified => PARTIAL; a rule with two halves
where one was verified => PARTIAL, always. DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT is NEVER yours to choose (owner decision, D13):
where a rule belongs to a facility docs/CONFORMANCE.md §5 declares Not claimed, say so in notes and give
NEEDS-OWNER-DECISION only if no derived selector already covers it (the dossier lists the register notes that own rows —
PB260/PB261/PB281–PB283 own declined-module witness debt).
ONLY A SPEC-DERIVED TEST CLOSES A ROW: conformance:<edition>/<case>, unit:<Class>.<Method>, conformance-test:<Class>.<Method>
whose expected values are computed from the spec; nist:, characterization: and *_MatchesLegacy methods never qualify.
CONFORMS-but-untested (empty test-ref) is a legitimate, expected outcome — do not write goldens here.
The dossier in your input file is a MAP, not the territory: its silence is not evidence — a NOT-IMPLEMENTED verdict
needs your own search of ${PIN}/src.`

YOUR INPUT FILE: ${IN}/in-${slug}.json — read it whole (rules with id/kind/text/section, sibling parts, clause map, the
DOSSIER: grammar rules, citing source with lines, citing tests/goldens, CONFORMANCE.md determinations, kb/Work notes with
status — do NOT re-report a landed fix; an open/half note already owns its rows: reference it in notes — and
DIAGNOSTICS.md rows).
YOUR CHECKPOINT FILE: ${OUT}/adjudicate-${slug}.jsonl — one RECORD (the schema's record object) per line, appended the
moment each rule is decided; read-and-skip first.
Per rule: read the rule text and its general format; locate the implementing code from the dossier and confirm by
reading it; verify across the applicable editions and the adversarial edge cases the text implies (probe with the pinned
cobol.exe when reading cannot decide); assign the verdict; name an EXISTING spec-derived covering test or leave test-ref
empty. Cluster defective rows by MECHANISM into findings (one register-ready paragraph per mechanism, with a repro and
the spec-derived expected result); write the findings to ${OUT}/findings-${slug}.json as you go too.
When every rule is decided, also write the whole structured result to ${OUT}/out-${slug}.json and return it.`,

You are the INDEPENDENT REFUTER for subject file ${x.slug}. Refute ONLY the CONFORMS verdicts below — they move the
burn-down and are the only ones dangerous when wrong (a wrong PARTIAL is re-probed at fix time by rule). Every batch so
far overturned some of them, always DOWNWARD; an all-upheld report is a red flag — say what you did to break it. For
each: read the rule text yourself FIRST and derive what the code must do; then read the code at the adjudicator's
code-location in ${PIN}; probe with the pinned cobol.exe when reading cannot decide (edge values, other editions, the
operand shapes the rule names); check the cited test-ref really pins THIS rule's branch and is spec-derived; re-run
the citation through cite.py. Default to refuted when uncertain and name the corrected verdict.
