DISPATCH SPEC — wave {wave} ({letter}), {group}: {notes}
Brief: E:\CobolSharp\.claude\skills\workstream\templates\fix-lane-implementer-brief.md — read it WHOLE first; {{PB}} = {lead}.
Base: your worktree is cut from current main ({base}). CLAUDE.md rule 1 carries the ISO → GnuCOBOL → IBM/Micro Focus
precedence for implementation options; obey it.

Codes allocated: {codes}, in order; list the ones you use and RETURN the ones you do not.
Report: {S}\reports\{slug}-{lead}-report.md   (wave-prefixed, so a later agent never overwrites an earlier report)
Scratch:  {S}\{slug}\
Report your ACTUAL branch (`git branch --show-current`).
{pred}
THE GROUP IS ONE ROOT: {root}. Read every note first — {files} — they carry the forensic detail, the citations, the
probes and the CODE SITES. ⛔ START FROM THE NOTE'S CODE SITES (and `python scripts/spec/where.py <clause>` when it
exists) — do not re-survey the codebase: orientation (grep/read) was 46 % of every implementer's tokens in waves 45–57.
Do not re-derive what the notes measured, but DO re-run every probe on your own build.
⛔ DRIFT RULES (MANDATORY-PRACTICES P11): before editing any file run `python scripts/spec/drift_rules.py <files>` and
honor every SPECIFIC rule it prints — the drift tests will enforce them at your gate anyway.
C# NAVIGATION (P13): find definitions, references and callers with the LSP tool (goToDefinition / findReferences / incomingCalls on the .cs file) before grepping; grep stays right for text, COBOL, docs and generated files.

⛔ GRACEFUL STOP: before EACH new step check for {S}\STOP; if it exists, checkpoint-commit, write STATUS.md NEXT and
your report, and return status SPLIT. Never start a build or gate once STOP exists.

⛔ HOW TO WAIT FOR A LONG JOB (measured 2026-09-22, wave 45): a workflow agent that ENDS ITS TURN while a background
build/gate is running is RETURNED BY THE HARNESS AND ITS BACKGROUND PROCESS IS KILLED. So:
1. Start the gate in the background, logging to a file:
     PowerShell (run_in_background): pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/build-local.ps1 -Filter "<filter>" -Priority BelowNormal *> <log>
2. Then BLOCK in the foreground until the verdict line appears, in chunks under the 10-minute tool limit:
     Bash (timeout 590000): timeout 580 bash -c 'tail -n +1 -f "<log>" | grep -m1 -E "=== WAVE-LOCAL GATE: "' ; tail -3 "<log>"
   If it times out with no verdict, issue the SAME command again. Do not use `sleep`; do not end your turn.
3. Only after the verdict line is in hand: record it, checkpoint, write the report, return the structured result.

⚠ SIZING: if the group proves to be two mechanisms, finish the first at its root, checkpoint at the note boundary, and
return SPLIT rather than pass the 220-turn cap.

⛔ RE-PROBE FIRST, EVERY NOTE, on YOUR build (`dotnet build CobolSharp.sln -c Debug`, expect 0/0). A note that no longer
reproduces is re-verdicted and reported DISCHARGED with the evidence — a real outcome, not a failure.

⛔ CITATIONS: `python scripts/spec/cite.py --check <clause> "<text>"` for EVERY § you write into code, a golden or the
report — including the ones the notes carry. A citation you did not --check is not a citation.

⛔ PUBLIC SKILLS (MANDATORY-PRACTICES P10): before work read E:\claude-skills\skills\engineering-standards\SKILL.md,
dotnet-engineering\SKILL.md and spec-oracle\SKILL.md; for the sibling sweep apply variant-analysis\SKILL.md (+ roslyn-analysis
for compiler-fact queries); before the report SELF-REVIEW your diff against E:\claude-skills\agents\pr-test-analyzer.md,
silent-failure-hunter.md and comment-analyzer.md (+ type-design-analyzer.md if you add/reshape a type). Project rules win on conflict.

⛔ SIBLING SWEEP (CLAUDE.md rule 4): every bug is a pattern. Which ARM of the dispatch did you fix, and where is the other?

GATE: your own tests + `~Drift|~EditionGate` + the Unit assembly, ALWAYS with `-Priority BelowNormal`. A shared seam
(any `.g4`, the MOVE emitter/classifier, the reference resolver, the EC emitter, code every verb shares) ADDS
`~CorpusRunner|~Nist` — say so. ⛔ NEVER run the whole Conformance assembly — that is the lander's job.
⛔ `python scripts/semgrep/verify.py` must not increase any rule's count (train 57 dropped a cluster for +20 BigInteger).
Print a real verdict line; never leave a placeholder in the report.

GOLDENS: one positive at the introducing edition + one negative below it, a copy per edition only where behaviour differs.
Every golden/negative you ADD must RUN BY NAME at your gate (`DisplayName~<name>` or the corpus leg) — quote its pass line (MANDATORY-PRACTICES I7).
Parser + emitter + golden + manifest entry in ONE commit.

REGISTER: flip each note's `status` and write its `closes_rows` IN THE COMMIT THAT LANDS IT (with `closes_rows_reason:`
when it closes none). Run `python scripts/spec/work.py check`. Do NOT open a list anywhere — new defects are LEADS in your
report, each with its repro path and code site (file:line) so the registrar does not re-survey.

CHECKPOINT: `git commit -m "WIP checkpoint: …"` after every mechanism and every gate, plus `STATUS.md` (DONE / NEXT /
BLOCKED / GATE / batch paths / codes used). Turn cap 220 — at the cap, checkpoint, write NEXT, return SPLIT.

Report ≤ 60 lines, following `templates/implementer-report-template.md`, one section per note.
