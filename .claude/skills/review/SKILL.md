description: Use when asked for a code review, architecture review, performance review, or duplication/efficiency analysis - the four review dimensions the owner requires, run as parallel agents with project-specific criteria and adversarial verification.

# Review

The owner requires **four review dimensions** because this is a commercial product with a decade-plus lifetime
(`PROMPT.md` §4, memory `project_required_reviews`). They are continuous criteria on every change AND a
comprehensive pass once the design settles.

Generic review tooling does not know this project's rules — that a `decimal` is banned, that a bound node carrying
C# text is a seam violation, that a fix without an ISO citation is incomplete. Review against THESE criteria.

## First: run the mechanical checks — they are free

```
python scripts/semgrep/verify.py
```

Six architectural invariants from `COBOLNET_DESIGN.md` §1.2 are already mechanized (banned numeric types, persisted
byte storage, silent TODOs, raw diagnostic literals, backend-neutrality). Anything it catches needs no human
judgment. Do not spend review effort on what a pattern already covers — and if the review finds a defect class a
rule COULD catch, add the rule (`scripts/semgrep/invariants.yml`) rather than only reporting the instance.

## The four dimensions

Run them as **parallel agents, one per dimension** — they are independent and each needs a different lens. Give each
the diff (or the subsystem) plus the criteria below.

### 1. Architecture
Folder/file layout and naming · single-responsibility, no god classes · clean phase boundaries (no semantics in the
parser, no codegen in the binder, no runtime logic in compile-time structures) · no cross-layer write-back, the
emitter never mutates the binder's model · one canonical mechanism per job, no parallel second · backend
neutrality: no C# text, Roslyn syntax, mangled identifier or format literal in a bound node or `Place`.

### 2. Full code review
Correctness against the CITED ISO rule — does the code implement the rule it names, or a convenient paraphrase? ·
sibling/paired functions agree · error handling: loud failure, never a silent no-op or swallowed exception ·
comment and doc accuracy (a comment that lies is worse than none) · idiomatic modern C# · every implemented rule
carries its exact §/GR.

### 3. Performance
Hot paths and allocation behavior · data-structure fit · compile throughput · `Span<T>`/`ReadOnlySpan<T>` where a
copy is being made · anything O(n²) over the corpus or the symbol table.

### 4. Duplication and efficiency
Repeated logic · two mechanisms doing one job · redundant recomputation of something the binder already resolved ·
anything a single canonical implementation should absorb. This is the dimension most often skipped and the one the
owner named explicitly.

## Verify before reporting

Review output is candidate findings, not conclusions. **Adversarially verify each one** — spawn a skeptic per
finding prompted to REFUTE it, and default to refuted when uncertain. A plausible-but-wrong finding costs more than
a missed one, because it sends the next session to rewrite working code.

When a verification pass AGREES, check that it agrees with the REASONING. A right answer held for a wrong reason is
a latent defect — record corrected rationales, not just corrected verdicts.

## Report

Use `ReportFindings` when the host asks for it; otherwise a ranked list, most severe first. Every finding needs a
concrete failure scenario (inputs/state → wrong output), not a style opinion. **Findings become tracked work** — a
real defect goes into `docs/rearchitecture/CONFORMANCE-FIX-QUEUE.md`, not into prose that evaporates.

If nothing survives verification, say so plainly. An empty review is a valid result.

## Scale

"Review this diff" → the four dimensions, single-vote verification. "Audit this subsystem" or "be comprehensive" →
a larger finder pool per dimension, 3-5 vote adversarial verification, and a completeness critic asking what was
not examined. The comprehensive whole-source pass is owner-scheduled for the conformance milestone.
