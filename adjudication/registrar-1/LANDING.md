# registrar-1 — landing hand-off for the owner's LOCAL orchestrator (kb/Work PB1522 step 2)

Branch `claude/adj-registrar-1` (cut from `0caa7d5`). Land it through `bash scripts/push-main.sh`; this cloud session
wrote NO DEVLOG entry and did NOT touch plan §0 (PB1522: the local orchestrator owns both). Re-apply verdict batches with
`record_verdicts.py` on the merged tree if main moved (practice L6) — the inventory hunk is two batch files' worth:
`batch-nondoc.json` then `batch-r42.json`.

## Owner decision R42 (verbatim, given to the orchestrator 2026-09-24; `kb/Work/R42.md` lands on main separately)

> "every A.1 item that belongs to a DECLINED module (screen handling A.4.2, commit/rollback A.4.3 - docs/CONFORMANCE.md
> section 5 Not claimed) closes as DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT, the same withdrawal ground as DOC-A.1-84/85/86/173 (A.1
> preamble: the item is not required if the optional feature is not implemented). In the registrar step, record such rows
> as DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT with notes citing R42 + the section 5 row and a witness test that diagnoses the declined
> construct (e.g. conformance:negative/a42-options-initialize-screen, conformance:negative/apply-commit-lock-mode).
> Wave-1 rows affected: DOC-A.1-3, 4, 11, 27, 28, 41, 45, 83, 91. Apply the same to any wave-2 row of that shape instead
> of NEEDS-OWNER-DECISION. DOC-A.1-47 (FLOAT-DECIMAL) is NOT covered - it stays with PB579."

## Drafted DEVLOG paragraph content

**Title:** Cloud registrar-1 — both adjudication waves registered: 22 rows recorded (GAP 1664 → 1652), R42 implemented as
selector data, 126 A.1 rows held on an owner decision, 14 new kb/Work notes.

- **Inputs.** 11 `claude/adj-*` branches, 208 distinct rule-ids = exactly the 208 verdict-less inventory rows (wave 1: 90,
  wave 2: 118; pinned `0caa7d5`). Adjudicated histogram: DIVERGES 79 · NEEDS-OWNER-DECISION 71 · PARTIAL 31 · CONFORMS 15
  · NOT-IMPLEMENTED 12. Refuters: wave 1 applied its overturns on the branches; wave 2 attacked 9 CONFORMS rows, 8 upheld,
  1 overturned (SR-5.5-2 CONFORMS → PARTIAL, the boolean shift count, PB1413); `adj-w2-14-s1` ran no refuter (all 22 rows
  NEEDS-OWNER-DECISION).
- **Shape.** `normalize.py` fixed wave 1's shape violations at source — editions lists/prose → comma strings (prose to
  notes, 14 records), code-location commentary → notes (61 records), unresolvable `Class.Member` symbols re-sited to the
  resolving member, the computed DOC anchor added. No verdict changed, no evidence dropped.
- **Recorded.** `batch-nondoc.json` 11 rows — PARTIAL 5, DIVERGES 3, NOT-IMPLEMENTED 2, CONFORMS 1 (closed) — GAP
  1664 → 1663. `batch-r42.json` 11 DOC rows → DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT (3, 4, 11, 27, 28, 41, 45, 83, 91, 172, 199), each on
  the negative golden that diagnoses its declined construct — GAP 1663 → 1652. **Total +12 closed.** No record dropped
  (rows changed = records).
- **R42 made structural (rule 4/5).** Stamping the eleven rows by hand turned `AnnexA1RegisterDriftTests` red (verdicted
  items with no §7 row, outside the audit's derived `unreachable`): the screen selector held every A.1 row out with the
  boilerplate pattern "This item is (required|optional)." and the commit selector listed DOC-A.1-28 among its excluded
  antecedents — both pre-R42 scope calls. `screen-handling-only` gained two kind-DOC arms (xref into a declined A.4.2
  clause; the SCREEN FORMAT of ACCEPT/DISPLAY/SET keyed on the item's own words, so device items 1, 2, 5, 111 stay out)
  and its text arm now excludes DOC by kind; `commit-and-rollback-only` gained a kind-DOC xref arm. They select exactly
  the eleven R42 items; the audit derives 15 withdrawn / 184 in scope with no edit; `DerivedVerdictDriftTests` pins the
  set and the four device items that must stay out; CONFORMANCE.md §7 denominator paragraph and §5 row counts updated.
- **Held (not recorded).** `batch-doc.json`, 126 DOC rows (DIVERGES 76 · PARTIAL 26 · CONFORMS 14 · NOT-IMPLEMENTED 10).
  Trial-applied and measured (`doc-trial-gate.txt`): filtered gate Failed 4 / Passed 46 — 122 computed anchors
  `docs/CONFORMANCE.md#DOC-A.1-N` resolve nowhere, 122 items verdicted without a §7 row, 14 closing on tests without a §7
  row; inventory restored. Owner question **PB1535**.
- **Owner questions.** PB1535 (how to record an A.1 determination fixed by code but absent from §7; options a/b/c,
  recommendation (c) now + (a) item by item; plus the "need not be documented but CONFORMS" sub-case: 35, 69, 104, 118,
  119, 125, 138, 169, 170, 194, 201, 220). PB1536 (Q1 conditionally-required A.1 items whose condition is absent — 149,
  152, 200 + 30, 34, 37, 142, 143, 88, 96, 98; Q2 retire FMT-5.2). Extended: PB1198 Q1 + DOC-A.1-212 (does R42's ground
  reach the declined A.3 4) MCS facility?), PB1099 Q3 + DOC-A.1-161/-162, PB468 Q9 + GR-4.4-1/-2, PB579 + DOC-A.1-47;
  PB1151, PB1255, PB1517, PB1518, PB1519 now claim their re-adjudicated rows.
- **New notes (one per mechanism).** PB1523 GLOBAL bridge duplicate/phantom → CS0102/CS1061 backend crash (MAJOR,
  crashes; contradicts the recorded GR-13.18.27.4-3 CONFORMS) · PB1524 EC-OO-RESOURCE never raised (MAJOR, crashes) ·

  instance-file close on an orphan RunUnit (MAJOR, wrong answer) · PB1533 DEFINE PARAMETER env-name case (MINOR) ·
  PB1534 analysis, 41 A.1 determinations with no item note · PB1535 / PB1536 decisions. 44 owning notes extended
  (`owners_map.py`). Wave-2 leads re-probed on the Debug build before filing (PB1523, PB1525, PB1526, PB1527, PB1528;
  PB1524 by code reading); PB1529 and PB1531 re-probed too.
- **CONFORMS test-needed** (golden lane): recorded — none (SR-13.18.27.3-1 closed on its witnesses). Held in
  `batch-doc.json`: DOC-A.1-69, DOC-A.1-169, DOC-A.1-220.
- **Gate.** `work.py check` clean; `dotnet build CobolSharp.sln -c Debug` green; filtered gate
  `SpecTraceabilityInventory|DefectiveRowCoverage|DerivedVerdict|AnnexA1|WorkRegister` **50/50**; Unit
  `~Drift|~Inventory|~Schema|~Derivation` **26586/26586**; `audit_annex_a1 --self-test` all green;
  `gen_conformance_notes --check` 15 notes match; `work.py parity` no findings. The full Conformance assembly was NOT run
  (verdict/doc/schema-only change set + one test file).

## Plan §0 refresh

GAP **1652** of 4348 (was 1664). Verdict-less rows: 208 → **186** (126 DOC held on PB1535 + 60 NEEDS-OWNER-DECISION).
A.1 audit: 15 items withdrawn, 184 in scope (`python scripts/spec/audit_annex_a1.py`).

## Adjudicator / refuter output found false

- The adjudicators' brief called a MISSING §7 determination "DIVERGES"; the schema defines DOC DIVERGES as "§7 documents
  one thing and the compiler does another". 112 of the 116 CONFORMS/PARTIAL/DIVERGES DOC rows have no §7 row at all —
  the verdicts are held (PB1535) rather than recorded under a meaning the schema does not allow.
- The orchestrator's expectation that the R42 rows would leave the gate green was false as measured (above); fixed
  structurally, not by exempting the rows.
- DOC-A.1-28's adjudicated code-location named `src/Cobol.Net.Compiler/Binding/StatementBinder.cs`; the file is
  `Binding/Bound/StatementBinder.cs`. Many wave-1 code-locations carried commentary or non-resolving `Class.Member`
  symbols (normalized, originals kept in notes).
- The prompt's "GR-13.18.27.4-3 recorded CONFORMS" is right but that CONFORMS is contradicted by PB1523's `rr.cob`
  (the program in which B resolves does not compile); the row is claimed by PB1523 for re-verdict.

## Step 3 (doc-rows-1)

Branch `claude/adj-doc-rows-1` (cut from `claude/adj-registrar-1`), dir `adjudication/doc-rows-1/`. Owner decision kb/Work
PB1535 option (c): write the missing `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` §7 determination rows, then record the 126 held DOC rows item by item.

**Drafted DEVLOG paragraph content.** Six writer batches (`doc-w1-s1..s6`, 21 items each) wrote a §7 row for every item from the
code or a probe; an independent refuter attacked each row against the code and the spec; the integrator merged them
(`merge.py` → `merged.jsonl`), re-checking by probe or by GnuCOBOL 3.2 source every fact the two disagreed on
(`integrator-checks.json`). Decisions: WRITE 62 · KEEP 1 · NOT-PROVIDED 5 · OMIT 45 · SKIP 13. Refuter outcome: 26 items corrected
(19 row corrections, 3 record-only, 4 turned to OMIT — 53, 55, 103, 114 on the rule-1 GnuCOBOL precedent — and 198 turned from
NOT-PROVIDED to a provided WRITE); the integrator lowered 181 to PARTIAL (it documented the same figurative-constant
over-rejection the refuter proved for 42) and replaced row 187's "PB-new" placeholder with PB1542.
- **§7:** 67 rows written (65 appended in item order, 72 and 128 replaced in place). `audit_annex_a1.py`: every row `ok`;
  **125 of 184** in-scope obligations discharged, **59 remain** (was 47 / 148); voluntary rows 35 61 69 90 92 104 118 119 123 125
  138 144 169 170 186 194 201 220. Preamble numbers and the Not-provided list (7 64 106 127 143 150 193 196) updated.
- **Rule-6 sweep in the same change:** §3's compile-time arithmetic bullet → row 29 (it said division truncates); FLAG-02/-14 no
  longer "not yet emitted" (rows 79/80); leap second keyed to item 111 (+ `LeapSecondDirectiveProcessor`, the intrinsics design);
  ERROR/NORMAL mapping is item 192; a .NET host enters through `ProgramRegistry.CallProgram` (row 65); §2 row 27 → row 186; row
  62's dangling item-60 reference → PB1410; >>DISPLAY flagged as PB1538; FILES_DESIGN + the pb673 golden comment follow row 72;
  COBOLNET0825 cites §14.9.23.3 SR4 a)/b) (was SR4d); `FileStatus` '71' summary no longer claims termination with checking off.
- **Verdicts:** `batch-doc-v2.json`, 68 records — CONFORMS 51 (24 closed, 27 test-needed) · PARTIAL 12 · DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT 5
  (the `a1-optional-not-provided` selector, PB280 Q1). **GAP 1652 → 1627.** OMIT/SKIP rows stay verdict-less.
- **Test-needed (golden lane):** CONFORMS DOC-A.1-6 8 16 21 26 29 32 43 44 65 69 72 74 76 78 95 97 101 111 118 132 148 169 182 186
  198 220; DNS 7 106 143 196.
- **kb/Work:** new PB1537 (SR11 figurative screen over-rejects), PB1538 (>>DISPLAY), PB1539 (AS-name spaces), PB1540 (LINE
  SEQUENTIAL delimiter), PB1541 (permanent error persistence), PB1542 (CODE-SET screen / EBCDIC crash), PB1543 (Unicode whitespace
  text-word separator), PB1544 (symbolic character as intrinsic argument), PB1545 (X"…" at --std 85, to confirm). Extended PB322
  PB1496 PB1526 PB1527 PB1397 PB1422 PB1369 PB1402 PB547 PB807 PB833 PB1276 PB690 PB1092 PB538 PB1536 A11 PB1253. PB1530 LANDED
  (documentation fix, no row closed). PB1534 open on 10 item-owned rows. PB1522 claims the 58 OMIT/SKIP rows + DOC-A.1-201.
- **Drift test moved, not weakened:** `DerivedVerdictDriftTests.TheA1OptionalNotProvidedSelector_IsStillSharp` used item 7 as its
  "optional but undetermined" anchor and turned red when item 7's row landed — exactly its own message's instruction; the anchor is
  now item 67, and item 7's selection is asserted. `inventory-schema.json`'s selector narrative re-measured (8 selected).
- **Gate (this branch):** `dotnet build CobolSharp.sln -c Debug` 0 warnings 0 errors; filtered unit gate
  (SpecTraceabilityInventory|DefectiveRowCoverage|DerivedVerdict|AnnexA1|WorkRegister|Conformance) **Passed 80 / 80**;
  ClosesRowsBackLink|VaultReference|WorkFrontmatter 5 / 5; `work.py check` well-formed; `gen_conformance_notes.py` regenerated
  (1627 GAP); `audit_witness_loss.py --check` GREEN.

**Plan §0 refresh:** GAP **1627** of 4348. Verdict-less rows 186 → **118** (58 A.1 OMIT/SKIP + 60 NEEDS-OWNER-DECISION). A.1
register: 143 items determined, 125 of 184 obligations discharged, 59 remain.

**Writer / refuter output found false (step 3):** writer 6/7 "no implicit FILLER" (false for bit items); 16 omitted the
checking-off termination; 35's Pinned-by named two goldens that do not pin the correspondence; 42 and 181 documented the SR11
over-rejection as the rule; 51 overclaimed Linux handle blocking; 72 said the TO phrase is compared after host-path resolution (it
is the operand text); 74's ORD example ignored the collating sequence; 95/97 omitted COBOL-2002 from editions; 111 named the wrong
FORMATTED-CURRENT-DATE symbol; 139 missed an explicit >>TURN's LOCATION; 153 presented item 131's unsettled default sharing as
settled; 186 stated an off-by-one ordinal; 187 claimed CONFORMS over its own defect; 198 called a provided restriction "Not
provided"; 213's record had a bare greenfield path. Writers' WRITE for 53/55/103/114 documented behaviour rule 1's precedent makes
defective.
