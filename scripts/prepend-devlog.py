"""Insert a new DEVLOG entry at the TOP, in bytes, without touching the other 36,000 lines.

    python scripts/prepend-devlog.py <entry.md> [<entry.md> ...]

Entries are inserted in the order given, so the LAST file named ends up nearest the top — pass them
oldest-first and the descending order comes out right.

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT WORKS IN BYTES. `DEVLOG.md` is CRLF and unnormalized. Any tool that reads it as text
and writes it back — `sed -i`, a naive Python `read_text`/`write_text`, most editors — re-encodes every line
ending and produces a 36,000-line diff around a twenty-line addition, which destroys the reviewability of the one
change that matters and makes `git blame` useless for the entry. So this reads bytes, splices bytes, and writes
bytes; the only lines in the diff are the ones added.

⛔ AND READ THE DIFFSTAT, NOT THE EXIT CODE. A successful run adds exactly the entry's own line count. Anything
else means the file was re-encoded, and the exit code will not tell you.
