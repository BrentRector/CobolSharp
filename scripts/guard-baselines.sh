# guard-baselines.sh — THE baseline-cleanliness audit over tests/nist/valid, in ONE place.
#
# usage: bash scripts/guard-baselines.sh [<valid-dir>] [<corpus.tsv>]
# exits with the NUMBER of failures (0 = clean), and prints one `=== ERROR: … ===` line per failure.
#
# ⛔ WHY IT IS ITS OWN FILE. `guard.sh` and `guard-fast.sh` each carried a byte-similar copy of this loop —
# `guard-fast.sh`'s comment even said "parity with guard.sh" — and when kb/Work PB436 gave ONE golden a
# declared, spec-derived CCVS failure it taught `guard-verdict.sh`'s comparison arm about the allowance and
# NEITHER copy of this one. The Windows gate never runs these bash legs, so the train was green locally and
# the CI Guard job was red on `NC201A.txt has 1 FAIL*` (landing train 36). One rule, one place.
#
# The three things a baseline must not be, and the one thing it may be:
#   (1) 0 bytes — it would match an empty or crashed run vacuously;
#   (2) carrying a `FAIL*` detail line;
#   (3) carrying a non-zero `NNN TEST(S) FAILED` footer (real even with no FAIL* line — the IX108A shape);
#   … UNLESS the program is DECLARED a CCVS defect in the corpus manifest — a row whose note carries the
#   `CCVS-DEFECT` marker, which `EveryDivergent_CitesSpec` forces to carry an ISO § because the declaration
#   must be `divergent`. That is the same rule, read from the same file, that
#   `CorpusManifestTests.GoldensCarryingACcvsFailure_AreExactlyTheDeclaredCcvsDefects` states as a SET
#   EQUALITY — and this script measures the selector's COMPLEMENT for the same reason it does: a declaration
#   left behind after a golden is repaired is as much a defect as an undeclared failure.
