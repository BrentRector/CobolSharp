"""Normalize a Phase-B batch file into the exact shape `record_verdicts.py` accepts — reporting every change.

    python scripts/spec/normalize_batch.py scratchpad/phase-b/b5/out-*.json --in-place

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT REPORTS. `record_verdicts.py` validates ALL-OR-NOTHING and accepts only
`verdict · code-location · test-ref · editions · notes`. A batch that carries anything else is rejected whole —
correctly, because a partially-applied batch is the worst outcome available (the rows that DID land look exactly
like reviewed work). But the fix must not be "delete the offending fields": an agent's `evidence` is the reason
its verdict is believable, and dropping it silently would convert a reviewed verdict into an unsourced one.

So:
  · `evidence` is FOLDED INTO `notes`, never discarded.
  · A `test-ref` that does not parse is REMOVED and the reason appended to `notes` — a non-resolving ref cannot
    close a row anyway (the C# gate `SpecTraceabilityInventoryDriftTests` enforces that), so keeping a malformed
    one only makes the batch un-mergeable. The obvious `path/To/Class.cs#Method` shape is REWRITTEN to the
    canonical `unit:` / `conformance-test:` form where the directory says which it is; anything else is dropped.
  · Every change is printed. A silent normalizer would be a second place verdicts can change without a reader.
