"""Build / refresh the traceability inventory — the P14 burn-down instrument.

`scripts/session-probe.ps1` already looks for tests/version-matrix/traceability-inventory.json and reports
"invent: N rows · M GAP (v1.0 = zero GAP)". Until now that file did not exist, so the probe said "not built yet"
and the project had no burn-down number at all.

This seeds one inventory row per normative rule from the Phase-A catalog, and is RESUMABLE by design: an existing
row's verdict, code-location, test-ref and notes are PRESERVED across re-runs (the design doc requires that a
rule's verdict persist across sessions — Phase B is many sessions of work). Re-running after the spec submodule
moves adds new rules and reports removed ones; it never silently discards adjudicated work.

    python scripts/spec/build_inventory.py            # create or refresh
    python scripts/spec/build_inventory.py --stats    # report only, write nothing

⛔ THIS SCRIPT SEEDS ROWS; IT NEVER WRITES A VERDICT. Verdicts are recorded by `record_verdicts.py`, which merges
a validated batch file — see there for why hand-editing the inventory is not an option. The two agree because
neither owns the rules: the verdict vocabulary, each verdict's required evidence and the GAP/OK derivation are
DATA, in `tests/version-matrix/inventory-schema.json`, loaded through `inventory_schema.py`.

Row schema (one per rule):
    rule-id / section / kind / ordinal / subject         from the Phase-A catalog (regenerated, authoritative)
    state                                    derived — never written by hand; the GAP count is what session-probe
                                             reports and what v1.0 is defined against
    verdict / code-location / test-ref /     the adjudicated fields, preserved across every rebuild;
      editions / notes                       their vocabulary and requirements live in inventory-schema.json

    ⛔ WHY A ROW NEEDS ONE (kb/Work PB698). `prior` is keyed by rule-id and the adjudicated fields are carried
    across a rebuild by that key alone, so the rebuild is only safe while an id names the same RULE it named
    last time. It does not: a sub-list id is POSITIONAL (`…-L<sublist>.<n>`), so when a sub-list above it stops
    existing — as it does whenever a nested list's transcription is re-levelled — every id below SHIFTS DOWN and
    silently inherits a verdict that was adjudicated against different text. PB698's repair moved six such rows
    at once, and nothing in this script could see it: `added`/`removed` compare ids, and `subject` is the rule
    BLOCK's subject, identical for every row of the block. The digest is the missing observation.
