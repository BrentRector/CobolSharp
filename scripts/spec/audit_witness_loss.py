"""Watch the axis nothing else watches: a traceability-inventory row LOSING a witness (kb/Work PB959).

    python scripts/spec/audit_witness_loss.py --check [--base REF]      # the gate: working tree vs merge-base
    python scripts/spec/audit_witness_loss.py --history [--since REV]   # every loss in the inventory's git history
    python scripts/spec/audit_witness_loss.py --history --restore-batch OUT.json   # ...and a batch owing them back
    python scripts/spec/audit_witness_loss.py --self-test               # prove the check FAILS on a planted loss

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. `code-location` and `test-ref` are the EVIDENCE a row's verdict stands on, and the inventory is
the instrument that defines "done" for this project. Until PB959, `record_verdicts.py` assigned both fields by
blind overwrite, so a batch that re-typed two of a row's five witnesses silently deleted the other three, and one
that omitted the field emptied it. `SpecTraceabilityInventoryDriftTests.EveryTestRef_ResolvesToARealTest` checks
that each SURVIVING reference RESOLVES — deliberately not how many there are — so a subtraction of perfectly valid
evidence left every gate green and every derived artifact (the burn-down, the owner's ledger) unchanged. A row
whose witnesses were removed still reads CONFORMS; it simply no longer has the evidence that justified it.

WHAT COUNTS AS A LOSS is defined ONCE, in `inventory_schema.witness_losses`, and the writer asks the same function
at record time — so this auditor and `record_verdicts.py` cannot come to disagree about it. Two losses are
EXCUSED, and both are printed: a RETIREMENT (the writer records `retired-witness: <ref> (<reason>)` in the row's
`notes` when a batch retires a witness by name), and a RE-SITE (a record that changes the verdict restates the
row's `code-location` — see `inventory_schema.WITNESS_FIELDS` for why). Every other loss is RED.

WHAT IS NOT A WITNESS LOSS: a ROW that disappears. Rows are regenerated from the rule catalog by
`build_inventory.py`, which owns a row's existence; such rows are counted and printed, never gated.

WHETHER A RESTORED REFERENCE STILL RESOLVES is NOT decided here. That is the C# battery gate's job (the division
of labour in `inventory_schema.py`); a `--restore-batch` is applied through `record_verdicts.py` and then gated
by `SpecTraceabilityInventoryDriftTests`, which names every restored reference that points at nothing.
