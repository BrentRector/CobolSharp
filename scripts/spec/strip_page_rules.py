"""Remove the horizontal rules left behind by de-paging.

A printed page boundary was transcribed as a block of three things: a `<a id="page-N">` anchor, a running
header, and a pair of `---` separators around them. De-paging removed the first two and left 769 of the third,
so the document is strewn with horizontal rules that used to mark a page boundary and now mark nothing. They
render as lines cutting through the prose, and 287 of them sit in pairs with nothing at all between.

THEY ARE RESIDUE, NOT A CONVENTION, and the document says so itself: of 2,691 headings, 2,380 have no rule
before them. An 11% minority is not a house style.

⚠ THE FRONT MATTER IS LEFT ALONE. Before clause 1 the rules are hand-authored editorial dividers — they
separate the title-page blocks (title, French title, reference number, copyright) and set off the preface's
`About this transcription` note. Those were never page furniture, and a rule that divides two blocks on ONE
printed page is doing a job.

Three invariants, all checked before anything is written: no word changes, no heading is created or destroyed,
and no rule is removed that would turn a line above it into a setext H2.
