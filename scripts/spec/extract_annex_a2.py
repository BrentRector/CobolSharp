"""Extract Annex A.2 — the standard's own UNDEFINED LANGUAGE ELEMENT LIST — into machine-readable data.

    python scripts/spec/extract_annex_a2.py              # regenerate tests/version-matrix/annex-a2-undefined.json
    python scripts/spec/extract_annex_a2.py --check      # exit 1 if the committed artifact differs from the spec
    python scripts/spec/extract_annex_a2.py --self-test  # prove every check here can FAIL

WHY THIS EXISTS. `DESIGN-spec-conformance-review.md` §1.1 (owner decision `kb/Work/PB386`, 2026-09-03) admits an
owner-signed DERIVATION in place of §1(c)'s spec-derived test for a rule that carries no observable obligation,
and the FIRST of its three arms is mechanical: the rule is on Annex A.2's list, which the standard states is the
list of "the COBOL language elements within this Working Draft International Standard that are explicitly
undefined" (`cite.py --check A.2` OK), and §4.4 2) then makes a run unit that reaches such a situation a
CONFORMING run unit. "Mechanically checkable" means the checker must be able to answer *does A.2 item n cover
inventory row r* without a human in the loop — which needs A.2 as DATA.

⛔ WHY A GENERATED ARTIFACT AND NOT A PARSE AT CHECK TIME. Two engines evaluate the derivation rule — this
repository's Python writer (`Schema.state_for`) and its C# battery gate (`DerivedState`) — and they must agree
(`kb/Work/PB315` is the note recording what happens when they do not). Parsing 1.3 MB of spec markdown in BOTH
languages would be a second parser of the same artifact, which is the duplication `feedback_one_rule_one_place`
names; and `EveryRowState_IsDerived_NotAsserted` recomputes the state of all 4,311 rows every build, so a
per-row re-parse would be a per-row 1.3 MB read. So the extraction lives HERE, once, and both engines read the
resolved data. `--check` re-derives and diffs, and `AnnexA2UndefinedListDriftTests` runs it every build, so the
artifact cannot drift from the standard silently — the `AnnexA1RegisterDriftTests` precedent.

⭐ WHAT MAKES THE NEXT A.2 ROW AUTOMATIC. Each A.2 item ends in the standard's own citation of the rule it is
about — `(14.9.5, CANCEL statement, General rule 11)` — so the item→rule mapping is DERIVED from the standard
rather than typed by anyone. Resolving that citation against `spec-rule-catalog.json` (component-wise clause
match + rule kind + ordinal) yields the inventory `rule-id`s the item covers. A future rule the standard declares
undefined therefore needs no edit to any list: it needs one register row naming `A.2 item <n>`.

⚠ TWELVE OF THE 66 ITEMS CITE A CLAUSE WITH NO RULE NUMBER (items 7–11, 15–18, 22, 36, 38 — Cursor, Incompatible
data, Overlapping operands, …). Those resolve to NO rule-ids, deliberately: an item that does not name a rule
cannot be mechanically shown to cover one, and inventing a mapping for it would be the unfalsifiable claim this
whole mechanism exists to refuse. An arm naming such an item is REFUSED, and that is the honest answer.
