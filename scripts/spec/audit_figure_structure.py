"""Audit the DELIMITER STRUCTURE of every general format: printed page versus transcription.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES, and it is the last one. Three whole-standard sweeps already exist:

    audit_figure_text.py    the WORDS of each figure          1 discrepancy in 15,625 tokens
    audit_underlining.py    which words are REQUIRED (5.2.2)  0 defects in 2,215 tokens
    figure_geometry.py      whether a group carries BARS      exception-phrase class closed 30/30

None of them checks the thing a reader of a general format depends on most: **which delimiter encloses which
rows**. A bracket that should span four rows but is drawn around one, a brace transcribed as a bracket, an outer
bracket dropped entirely — every one of those changes what the language permits, and every one survives all three
existing audits untouched. The reconciliation found real examples (lost outer brackets; garbled nesting in SORT
Format 2; a brace rendered as a bracket in MERGE), which is what makes this worth measuring rather than assuming.

HOW THE PRINTED STRUCTURE IS RECOVERED. Two different mechanisms, because the standard typesets the two families
differently — a fact established the hard way earlier in this work:

  * **brackets and choice-indicator bars are VECTOR RECTANGLES.** A bracket stem carries short horizontal feet; a
    bar is a bare rule. `figure_geometry.classify_page` separates them.
  * **braces are FONT GLYPHS** from the Symbol face — extensible pieces assembled into a tall brace. The top
    piece appears exactly once per brace, so counting left-brace tops counts brace pairs.

HOW THE TRANSCRIBED STRUCTURE IS RECOVERED. The house style draws tall delimiters with the Unicode extension
glyphs (U+23A1…U+23AD), one top piece per delimiter — so the same counting works on the Markdown.

⚠ WHAT A MISMATCH DOES AND DOES NOT MEAN — read this before quoting the number. It compares COUNTS PER PAGE,
not geometry, so its output is a SHORTLIST and not a defect list:

  * a page whose counts AGREE can still nest wrongly — counts are blind to which delimiter encloses what;
  * a page whose counts DIFFER is more often a rendering-convention difference than a defect. Page 393 draws
    `{ BIT } / { NATIONAL }` by repeating the brace on consecutive rows instead of using extension glyphs, and
    was scored as five missing braces when nothing at all is missing.

Both conventions are counted now, which helps without settling it: over the whole standard roughly 46 of 161
general-format pages disagree, and that is an UPPER BOUND still contaminated by layout. It is NOT a count of
broken figures and must not be quoted as one.

Making it precise means comparing per-figure GEOMETRY — which delimiter spans which rows, and what nests inside
what — on both sides, rather than totals per page. That is a larger piece of work and is not what this file does.

Confirm every candidate against the printed page before editing. Every audit in this directory has at some point
accused a correct page, and this is the least precise of them.

AMBIGUOUS RENDERINGS are reported separately. Where a figure draws a tall delimiter by repeating `[` on
consecutive rows rather than using the extension glyphs, its structure is genuinely unrecoverable from the text:
`[ [ AT END … ] ]` reads equally as a nested bracket or as one tall bracket carrying bars. That ambiguity is not
hypothetical — it is exactly how the READ statement's choice indicators were lost.
