"""Resolve the index references that de-paging left as bare printed folios.

57 index entries still read `Alphabetic character 3` — a printed page number with nothing to follow. The
index's own note says such references were left as text, but "documented" is not "resolved": the reader still
cannot get there.

A folio maps to the clause THE PAGE OPENS WITH, which is the same page-level approximation the note already
describes for the references converted earlier. Two things make that mapping trustworthy, and both were got
wrong on the first attempt:

  THE FRONT MATTER IS SKIPPED. It contains the table of contents, which is thousands of lines of
  `heading … number`. Scanning it for folios harvests TOC entries instead of page numbers, and the bad values
  land first and stick. Scanning starts at the page where clause 1 begins.

  THE CLAUSE IS THE ONE IN EFFECT AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE, carried forward from earlier pages — not the last
  heading printed on it. Most pages carry no heading at all: folios 5, 6 and 16 are all deep inside clause 3,
  Terms and definitions, and a "last heading on this page" rule silently attributes them to whatever heading it
  last saw, which is how folio 5 came out as clause 7.

⚠ A WRONG LINK IS WORSE THAN A PLAIN NUMBER. It misdirects silently, which is exactly the defect that made the
list of figures point at the wrong clauses. Every folio this script cannot map confidently keeps its printed
number, and `--report` shows what it would do before anything is written.
