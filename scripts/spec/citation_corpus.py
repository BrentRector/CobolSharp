"""The ONE definition of "the files that carry spec citations", shared by the citation audits.

⛔ WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A COPIED GLOB. There are two citation audits and they own DIFFERENT rules —
`audit_doc_citations.py` checks a QUOTED FRAGMENT against the clause it is filed under, `audit_code_citations.py`
checks the CLAUSE NUMBER against the construct the comment is about — but they must look at the SAME files, or a
citation is covered by one rule and not the other purely by where it happens to live. `audit_doc_citations.py`
already learned this once the hard way: it scanned only `docs/` until PB3's fabricated "GR7 k3" turned up in
THIRTEEN places across five source files (DEVLOG 13557/13606). One glob, one place.

    is NOT. Anything gitignored is by definition derived from something that is, and is covered through it.

    Two manufactured reds earned this. First the ANTLR build task's copies of every `.g4` under `obj/antlr-lib/`
    (each grammar finding reported twice, the copy frozen at the last build, a clean checkout and a built one
    disagreeing about the gate); that was answered with a hand-kept set of build-output directory names. Then
    `kb/Reference/` — gitignored output of `gen-vault-reference.ps1` — rendered weeks before the citation-repair
    sweep, so battery #42 printed 23 phantom clauses the tracked tree had already shed (kb/Work PB378). The
    directory-name set would have needed a third entry; the ignore rules already knew all three. One mechanism,
