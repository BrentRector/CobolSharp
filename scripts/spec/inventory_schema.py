"""The P14 traceability-inventory schema, loaded from data — imported by every Python consumer.

⛔ WHERE THE RULES LIVE. The verdict vocabulary, each verdict's `resolves` flag and each verdict's required
evidence fields are DATA, in `tests/version-matrix/inventory-schema.json`. Nothing here — and nothing in
`build_inventory.py`, `record_verdicts.py` or the C# gate — carries its own copy of that list. Adding a verdict is
an edit to the JSON and nothing else. This is CLAUDE.md rule 5 applied to the thing most likely to drift: the DA
wave's whole lesson (`feedback_one_rule_one_place`) was that every symptom traced back to one rule written down in
more than one place.

⚖ WHAT IS AND IS NOT DUPLICATED. Two engines evaluate these rules at two different times: this module at RECORD
time, and `SpecTraceabilityInventoryDriftTests` at BATTERY time. Both read the same JSON, so neither hard-codes a
verdict name, a flag or a field — what exists twice is the ten-line evaluator, not the rule. And the divergence
that would matter is itself gated: the C# side asserts every row's stored `state` equals the state the schema
implies, so a Python evaluator that drifted from the C# one turns the battery red instead of quietly inflating the
burn-down.

DIVISION OF LABOUR between the two, deliberately with NO overlap:
  · SHAPE      — verdict is in the vocabulary, required fields present, editions legal, rule-id known, and — for a
                 kind that declares evidence rules (`kinds`) — the computed register anchor is present and every
                 fragment on an `anchored-files` path is a legal anchor of that file's space. Decidable from the
                 record, the schema and THE REGISTER THE SCHEMA NAMES (`kinds.DOC.anchor-template` points at
                 docs/CONFORMANCE.md §7, and since 2026-09-02 `anchor_obliged` asks whether that document
                 actually carries the row — see below). It still does not go looking in `src/`.
                 Checked HERE, at record time, so a malformed batch never reaches the inventory.
  · REFERENCE  — the code-location symbol still exists, the test-ref names a test that is really on disk.
                 Checked ONLY by the C# battery gate, because it must keep holding as the tree changes underneath
                 an already-recorded row. Re-checking it here would be the same rule in two places.

    a selector. Until 2026-09-02 the schema's own $comment claimed that already — and it was false: no Python
    consumer of `derived-verdicts` existed, so the PB198 batch was produced by hand and the "two readers" that
    justify writing the predicate as data were one reader and an aspiration.

    THE SHAPE IS `arms`, and the arms are a DISJUNCTION of CONJUNCTIONS. Within an arm every field that is
    present must hold; a rule is selected when ANY arm holds and NO global `excludes-patterns` entry matches its
    text. Four modules of the 2026-09-02 landing needed four different scoping mechanisms and the flat
    requires-sections/requires-pattern pair could express only two of them:
      · `sections`       the rule's OWN clause (§8.8.1.4 is titled for the declined mode — PB198's lesson)
      · `pattern`        the rule's TEXT
      · `sections` + `pattern` together — an AND-gate. `file-name-1` is STATEMENT-LOCAL: in §13.4.5.4 it is the
        file description entry's own subject, so A.4.13's text arm ungated selects 176 rules instead of 12. The
        same gate is what reaches a rule scoped by OPERAND NAME — §12.3.7.3's data-name-1/-2 are the CURSOR and
        CRT STATUS operands and nothing else, and neither a clause arm nor a bare text arm can see them.
      · `xref-sections`  a clause citation inside the rule's text — how an Annex A.1 documentation obligation
        names the clause that creates it. Derived from the clause numbers, so adding a module clause extends the
        A.1 arm for free instead of silently not extending it.
      · `kinds` / `excludes-kinds` the rule's KIND, per arm. A general-format diagram (kind FMT) is evidence
        about a CLAUSE, never about one of its formats, so the TEXT axis must not select one: without this,
        FMT-14.9.1.2 and FMT-14.9.11.2 — the ACCEPT and DISPLAY formats, both PARTIAL, both carrying the
        compiler's most-used statement — flip to non-support because their optional format names screen-name-1.
        The CLAUSE axis still takes FMT-13.17.2, whose every format IS screen.
      · `requirement`   the A.1 REQUIREMENT CLASS the standard states for a DOC rule in its own text ("This item
        is optional." / "This item is required." / "conditionally required"), carried on the catalog row by
        `extract_rule_catalog.py`: 164 required · 30 optional · 27 conditionally required · 1 unclassified. It is
        the axis kb/Work PB280 Q1 turns on, and it exists because the licence for that determination is A.1's
        own preamble, which is written PER CLASS.
      · `determination-prefix`  what docs/CONFORMANCE.md §7 SAYS about this element — the register row keyed by
        the rule's own id (which is exactly the anchor `kinds.DOC.anchor-template` computes), matched on its
        leading words with markdown emphasis stripped. ⛔ This is the first arm field that reads an artifact
        outside the catalog, and that is the point: a determination is the DOC row's implementation, so a
        selector about determinations has nowhere else to look. An item with NO §7 row is not selected — nothing
        has been determined about it yet, and a MISSING determination is not a NEGATIVE one

          · the item is WITHDRAWN — the conditioning facility is not implemented, so A.1's preamble makes the
            item "not required if the optional or processor-dependent feature is not implemented" and §7 must
            carry NO row (items 84, 85, 173, 86). Nothing to anchor.
          · the element is OPTIONAL AND NOT PROVIDED — §7 DOES carry the row, because the non-provision IS the
            determination and A.1's preamble conditions the documentation duty on provision ("Documentation
            required: If the element is provided by the implementor …"). The row is the evidence, so the anchor
            is owed exactly as for CONFORMS (items 127, 206).
        Keying on the verdict alone answers both cases the same and gets the second one wrong: the row would be
        excused its own determination, and `check_pins` would stop holding its witness in agreement with §7's
        `Pinned by` — silently, at the moment the witness lands. So `anchor-exempt-verdicts` now names the

        This is the definition of DONE from `DESIGN-spec-conformance-review.md` §1, evaluated rather than
        asserted: (a) a located implementation or a recorded non-support decision, (b) a spec-verified verdict,
        (c) a covering spec-derived test. A row that merely says CONFORMS with nothing behind it stays a GAP —
        the point being that the GAP count is the v1.0 completion metric and must never be cheaper to move than
        the work it stands for.

        ⛔ The spec-derived clause is separate from `requires` ON PURPOSE, and it is the whole reason
        CONFORMS-but-untested is expressible: the rule can be verified against the code (a real, recordable
        finding) while no test yet pins it (so the row is not done). Folding the test into `requires` would force
        every such row to be misrecorded as PARTIAL or, worse, closed on whatever test happened to touch the
        function — which on the first Phase-B batch would have closed seven rows on NIST goldens and a
        `*_MatchesLegacy` differential.

        ⛔ A ROW OF A KIND THAT DECLARES EVIDENCE RULES PAYS THOSE TOO, and both are extra COSTS rather than an
        escape: its computed register anchor must be among its locations (a determination filed under the wrong
        item is not evidence for this row), and it must name an implementing site — a DOC row with nothing in the
        compiler to observe stays a GAP, because closing it would widen §1(a)'s definition of DONE and that is
        the owner's to widen (kb/Work PB280 Q2). The spec-derived test clause below then applies unchanged.

        ⚠ Both costs are charged only to a row with a determination to point at — the `anchor_obliged`
        predicate, not `anchor_for`. A DOC row an A.4 module WITHDRAWS (A.1's preamble: the item is not required
        if the optional or processor-dependent feature is not implemented) has no §7 row to anchor and nothing
        implemented to observe; it still owes its WITNESS test, which is the clause that keeps it open. A DOC row
        that is DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT because the OPTIONAL element is not provided (PB280 Q1) is the opposite
        case — §7 states the non-provision, so the row pays both costs like any other, and stays a GAP until a
        witness proves the documented posture is what actually happens. ⛔ Reading `anchor_for` here instead was a real
        defect (kb/Work PB315): the C# twin `DerivedState` had ALWAYS asked `AnchorObliged` and said in its own
        comment that "this side and the Python writer read ONE rule" — they did not, and the disagreement was
        unobservable until a declined DOC row first earned a witness test, at which point three rows could never
        close and `EveryRowState_IsDerived_NotAsserted` went red on a correct batch.
