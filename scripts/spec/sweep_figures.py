"""Replace every general format in the transcription with one generated from the printed page.

KEYED ON THE CLAUSE HIERARCHY, NEVER ON THE PAGE. A page number is a layout artifact — figures straddle page
breaks, and one clause's formats routinely span two pages — so a sweep keyed on "the nth block of page N"
mis-targets, and a mis-targeted replacement still looks like a figure. A figure's identity is its CLAUSE and
its FORMAT number (14.9.8.2 Format 2), which is what the printed page and the transcription agree on.

THE GATE, which is what makes this safe: a replacement is applied ONLY where the generated figure carries the
SAME WORDS as the text it replaces. Notation may change freely — that is the entire point of the sweep — but a
word appearing, vanishing or changing means the target is wrong or the page is one of the transcription's known
defects, and the figure is reported instead of written. `--report` shows what would happen without touching
anything; `--check` regenerates against the file and is the post-sweep regression gate.

THE TRANSCRIPTION DOES NOT FENCE EVERY FIGURE. Roughly a third of the general formats are one-liners set as
bare paragraphs — `\\>\\>compiler-instruction` on folio 54, `inline-invocation-1` and `identifier-2 object-view-1`
on folio 125. They are figures too, and they are where defects hide: folio 730 runs the NEXT format's label
into the figure line (`SET { identifier-7 } … TO identifier-8 Format 10 (data-pointer-arithmetic):`). Sweeping
only the fenced ones would leave the worst-transcribed third behind, in the old style.
