"""Back-fill `closes_rows:` onto the notes that have already landed — DERIVED, never asserted.

    python scripts/spec/backfill_closes_rows.py               # report what it would write; writes nothing
    python scripts/spec/backfill_closes_rows.py --apply       # write the frontmatter
    python scripts/spec/backfill_closes_rows.py --suspects    # the rows a landed note's closure did NOT reach
    python scripts/spec/backfill_closes_rows.py --self-test   # prove every derivation step here can FAIL

⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS. `closes_rows` (owner decision 2026-09-19, `kb/Work/PB245`) is the back-link from a landed fix
to the traceability-inventory rows it CLOSED. Every landing from here on writes it in its own change set — but
five hundred notes had already landed without it, and a field that is empty on the whole history is a field no
reader trusts and no gate can enforce. The back-fill is therefore part of the mechanism, not a tidy-up.

⛔ AND IT IS DERIVED FROM THE APPLIED BATCHES, NOT FROM RECALL. Verdicts are only ever written by
`record_verdicts.py`, and every application of one is a commit that changed
`tests/version-matrix/traceability-inventory.json`. Walking that file's history recovers exactly what each
landing changed: a row that moved from a NON-resolving verdict (or from no verdict at all) to a resolving one is
a row some landing closed, and the commit that did it is the landing. Nothing here reads a summary of the work;
it reads the work.

THE ATTRIBUTION RULE, in order — the first arm that yields a note wins:

  1. the PB ids named in the ROW'S OWN `notes` text after the change, intersected with the ids named in the
     COMMIT MESSAGE — the strongest evidence, because two independent records agree;
  2. the ids named in the row's `notes` alone — the batch said which note it was closing;
  3. the commit's single id, when the commit names EXACTLY ONE — a landing of one cluster;
  4. otherwise UNATTRIBUTED. A train that names five notes and a row that names none cannot be divided, and
     guessing would put a row on a note that did not close it, which is the failure this whole field exists to
     stop (`feedback_verdict_evidence_invariant`: a missing observation is not a negative one).

A second source joins that one: a TERMINAL note still holding a row in `inventory_rows` that the inventory
now calls OK. The register's own discipline says a row leaves `inventory_rows` when it is re-verdicted, so a
landed note still holding a closed row is a landing whose rows closed while it owned them.

⛔ WHAT IS WRITTEN. Both sources are filtered by the row's `state` TODAY — the schema's computed OK/GAP, which
is what the burn-down counts and is strictly stronger than 'the verdict resolves' (a CONFORMS row whose
covering test is missing is still GAP). A row that closed and later regressed is not a closed row, and
claiming it would turn `ClosesRowsBackLinkDriftTests` red for a reason that is not the note's fault. A `kind: defect` note that derives nothing gets `closes_rows: []` plus a
`closes_rows_reason` that SAYS it is derived, so a reader can tell a back-filled answer from a stated one.

⛔ IDEMPOTENT, AND IT NEVER OVERWRITES A HUMAN. A note that already carries `closes_rows` is left exactly as it
is and reported when the derivation disagrees: re-running this after an implementer has written the field by
hand must not silently replace their answer with a derived one.
