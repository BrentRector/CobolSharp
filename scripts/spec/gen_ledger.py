"""Render the owner's **COBOL.NET Conformance Ledger** artifact from the repo — every figure COMPUTED.

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. The ledger is the owner's live status page, and it was maintained by HAND: a session read the
inventory, the work register, the A.1 audit and plan §0, then retyped ~60 numbers into a 460-line HTML file. Two
failure modes follow from that shape and both had already happened elsewhere in this repo:

  * **A hand-copied number is a remembered number.** `gen_conformance_notes.py`'s docstring records the same
    lesson from the vault view — §15 claimed 533 GAP where the live number was 481, and the stale view was still
    read as current. A status page nobody can re-derive is worse than none, because it is believed.
  * **A hand-maintained page grows into a work list.** CLAUDE.md rule 8 permits exactly one work register
    (`kb/Work/`). This page is a DERIVED VIEW of that register and of the inventory — never a tracker — and the
    only way to keep it that way is to make it impossible to author anything here that is not read off a
    measured artifact. Everything on the rendered page except the in-flight narrative is computed by this file.

So a refresh is now: run this script, then publish `--out` to the artifact's existing URL. No retyping.

    python scripts/spec/gen_ledger.py                       # write the default --out
    python scripts/spec/gen_ledger.py --out ledger.html     # write somewhere else
    python scripts/spec/gen_ledger.py --check               # non-zero if --out is stale (mirrors
                                                            # gen_conformance_notes.py --check)

⭐ INPUTS, each one an artifact something else already gates:

    tests/version-matrix/traceability-inventory.json   rows, states, verdicts, kinds, clause buckets
    kb/Work/*.md frontmatter                           via work.py's own load()/actionable() — IMPORTED, never
                                                       re-implemented, so the ledger's "actionable" is the same

                                                       tree, and every leg's measured result
    docs/VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE.md                   the anchor dispositions (todo · gated · ref-only · pinned)
    tests/version-matrix/constructs.json               the matrix registry size
    tests/conformance/**                               the golden corpus, by edition
    git                                                HEAD sha + date, and how far HEAD has drifted from the
                                                       battery's tree (which is what makes "a battery is owed"
                                                       a measurement rather than an opinion)

⭐ THE TREND IS DATA, NOT MEMORY — `docs/rearchitecture/evidence/ledger-trend.json`. A burn-down chart is the one
thing on the page that cannot be recomputed from the current tree: yesterday's GAP is gone. So the series lives in
a small committed file, one point per battery or GAP-moving landing (`sha`, `date`, `gap`, `closed`, `dns`,
`label`, `battery`), and a WRITE run appends the current point when the measurement has moved. `--check` never
writes — it renders against the series plus the current point exactly as a write would, so a moved measurement
whose point has not been recorded shows up as staleness, which is the correct verdict.

⭐ THE ONE HAND-WRITTEN PART is `--in-flight` (default
`docs/rearchitecture/evidence/ledger-in-flight.md`), inserted VERBATIM as the body of the "In flight right now"
section. It is narrative — which lanes are running, which landings are queued, which owner questions are open —
and narrative is the only thing on this page a script has no business inventing. It carries no counts that this
script can compute; if a number in it can be measured, it belongs in the generator instead.

⚠ WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO: it does not decide anything. Every verdict, disposition and gate result it prints
was decided by the artifact it read. If a figure here looks wrong, the fix is in that artifact, never here.
