"""Rewrite the transcription's index as a real Markdown nested list.

WHY. The index is 3,123 lines of consecutive non-blank text with almost no list markup. Markdown joins
consecutive lines into ONE PARAGRAPH, so the whole of letter B renders as a single run-on block — every term
and every sub-entry flowing together. The links inside it all resolve; the structure around them was never
written. This is the same defect the table of contents had.

THREE THINGS ARE REPAIRED, and only these:

  LIST      A top-level term becomes `- term`; a sub-entry, currently indented with four `&nbsp;` entities,
            becomes a nested `  - sub-entry`. `&nbsp;` is a rendering hack for indentation that a list
            expresses natively, and it is what forced the flat structure in the first place.

  LEVEL     A sub-entry that lost its indentation is recovered from three sources, in this order:

            1. THE MEASURED PRINTED INDENTATION, which is the authority — `data/index-levels.json`, produced
               by `measure_index_levels.py` from the page and committed so this runs without the PDF.
            2. Alphabetical order, for entries the measurement cannot name unambiguously: inside `### B`, a
               column-0 entry that does not begin with B cannot be a top-level term. `Boolean expressions` is
               followed by `COMPUTE statement`, `EVALUATE statement` and `Parenthesis in` at column 0 — all
               sub-entries of it.
            3. In `Symbols` and `Numerics` there is no letter to agree with, but the TERMS are the symbols, so
               a line opening with a letter (`operator`, `Comment line`) is a sub-entry of the symbol above.

            Rules 2 and 3 agree with the printed page 2,485 times out of 2,503 checked. They are structurally
            blind to the other 18 — a sub-entry labelled `Definition` in section D begins with D, and nothing
            about the letter gives it away — which is exactly what rule 1 exists to settle.

  FURNITURE The 30 `---` rules left behind by page breaks. A page is not a thing in Markdown, and inside a
            list a horizontal rule terminates the list.

Letter headings are normalised to `###`, one level below `## Index`. They were written `### A` but `## B`
through `## Z`, which put 25 of the 26 letters at the same level as the index that contains them.

WORD CONSERVATION is the safety gate: this pass may only add list markers and remove `&nbsp;` and page rules,
so every word in the index must survive it. The script refuses to write if any word is lost or gained.
