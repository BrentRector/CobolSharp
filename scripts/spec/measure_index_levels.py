"""Measure the LEVEL of every printed index entry, and emit it as data for `relist_index.py`.

WHY THIS IS DATA AND NOT A HEURISTIC. `relist_index.py` can infer most lost sub-entries from alphabetical
order — inside `### B`, an entry that does not begin with B cannot be a top-level term. That inference is
right 2,485 times out of 2,503 checked, and it is structurally blind to the rest: a sub-entry labelled
`Definition` sitting in section D begins with D, so nothing about the letter gives it away. `Definition`
appears 75 times in the printed index and is a sub-entry every single time.

The printed page states the level directly — a sub-entry is set about 18 pt further right than its term — so
the answer is a MEASUREMENT, not an inference. This script takes it and writes it to
`scripts/spec/data/index-levels.json`, which is committed so that `relist_index.py` stays reproducible in the
public repo, where the licensed PDF is not available.

ONLY UNAMBIGUOUS ENTRIES ARE RECORDED. Index entry text repeats — 75 `Definition`s, 7 `operator`s — so a key
cannot identify WHICH printed line an entry came from. That does not matter when every printed instance of
that text carries the SAME level, which is the usual case; a key whose instances disagree is omitted and left
to the heuristic.

The index is set in two columns per page, each with its own left edge, so a level is "which of the two edges
of MY column am I at" and never an absolute x.
