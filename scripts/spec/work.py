"""THE WORK REGISTER — one note per work item under `kb/Work/`, and the only place work is authored.

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. "What is left to do" was authored in FIVE places, each in a different format, and three of
them declared themselves canonical:

    docs/COBOLNET_REARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md §0 NEXT   "the ONLY live-state SSOT"      buried in 3,614 lines
    docs/rearchitecture/CONFORMANCE-FIX-QUEUE.md   owns its own LANDED tally       2,484 lines of prose
    kb/Remaining Work Tracker.md                   "the canonical remaining-work tracker"   5 days stale
    §11 analysis backlog                           17 analyses                     inside the plan
    the queue's RESIDUE bucket                     ~10 findings                    prose, never itemised

When three artifacts each claim to be the source of truth, none is — and the cost was measurable: the residue
findings include a WRONG-ANSWER defect (`EXCEPTION-STATEMENT` returns `GO` where Table 12 requires `GO TO`) that
no work list could see, because it lived inside a paragraph.

⭐ THE FORM IS ONE NOTE PER ITEM, TRACKED IN GIT, WITH FRONTMATTER. Not one big JSON: a note gives Obsidian a
graph node (link an item to its spec clause and its code-reference note), gives git a per-item history instead of
a 2,484-line diff, and gives Bases every view without a query language. The forensic prose — repro, citation, why
a previous summary was wrong — lives in the note BODY, which is where it already was. Nothing is discarded.

    python scripts/spec/work.py migrate    # ONE TIME: fold the five registers into kb/Work/
    python scripts/spec/work.py check      # validate frontmatter; non-zero on a bad/missing field
    python scripts/spec/work.py next       # the ranked work list (session-probe prints this)
    python scripts/spec/work.py stats      # counts by kind/status/harm
    python scripts/spec/work.py parity     # the frontmatter reader vs. its C# twin's fixture (--json for the gate)

⭐ `inventory_rows:` — THE BACK-LINK TO THE P14 TRACEABILITY INVENTORY, and the register's newest field
(2026-08-31). A note lists the `rule-id`s it owns; that list is the SSOT for ownership, and the note's prose
"Rows:" line is narrative beside it. It exists because the two artifacts answering "what is left to do" had
NOTHING holding them together: of 138 inventory rows verdicted PARTIAL / NOT-IMPLEMENTED / DIVERGES, **131 were
invisible to `next`** when it was first measured — ranked by nothing, owed by nobody, and counted by the
burn-down the whole time.

⛔ The field is enforced by `DefectiveRowCoverageDriftTests` (tests/Cobol.Net.Tests.Unit) and NOT here, on
purpose: the predicate has to keep holding as the INVENTORY changes underneath a note, so it belongs to
something that runs every build, and validating a rule-id against the inventory from Python as well would be
the same rule in two places. What that gate asserts is that every defective-verdict row is claimed by a note
whose status is not terminal — so **flipping a note to `landed` without re-verdicting its rows turns the
battery red**, which is exactly the event that used to pass unnoticed.

⭐ `closes_rows:` — THE OTHER DIRECTION, and the register's newest field (owner decision 2026-09-19,
`kb/Work/PB245`). `inventory_rows` is what a note CLAIMS while it is open; `closes_rows` is what its landing
CLOSED, and it survives the landing. Without it, "which rows did this fix close" was answerable only by
re-measuring: fourteen §15 rows held the GAP open on mechanisms seven landings had already closed, and thirteen
closed CONFORMS the first time anyone looked. A landing therefore writes BOTH halves in the same change set —
the rows leave `inventory_rows` as they are re-verdicted, and they arrive in `closes_rows`. A landing that
closed no row says so with `closes_rows: []` **and** a `closes_rows_reason:`; silence is what the field
replaced. The spelling is `closes_rows`, not the decision's `closes-rows`: every multiword key in this
frontmatter is snake_case, and `kb/Work.base` addresses a property as `note.<key>`, where a hyphen would
at best need quoting and at worst read as an operator. Enforced by `ClosesRowsBackLinkDriftTests`
(tests/Cobol.Net.Tests.Unit); the SHAPE half is :func:`closes_rows_shape` here.

⛔ AND THE READER ITSELF IS A GATE. `parse_frontmatter` has a C# twin (`tests/_shared/WorkRegister.cs`), the two
read one file format, and they disagreed for months about a list WRAPPED across two lines (`kb/Work/PB875`):
this side truncated it, that side discarded it, and both called the note well-formed.
`tests/version-matrix/work-frontmatter-parity-cases.json` is the fixture both evaluate, and the C# gate runs
`work.py parity --json` so the comparison is against this engine RUN, not against an assumption about it.

    `tests/_shared/WorkRegister.cs`; `tests/version-matrix/work-frontmatter-parity-cases.json` is the fixture
    both evaluate, and `work.py parity --json` is how the C# gate runs THIS engine for real rather than assuming
    it. `kb/Work/PB875` is the note recording what the disagreement cost: a list WRAPPED across two lines — the
    normal YAML shape, and the shape `kb/Work/PB205` had carried for months — was read here as a truncated list
    and in C# as NO list at all, so a note went on claiming four inventory rows in the register while the gate
    that enforces claims saw none, and `work.py check` called the same note well-formed.

    ⛔ AND IT FAILED **OPEN**. Both halves answered a malformed value with emptiness, which reads exactly like a
    note that claims nothing — the one answer a register must never invent. An unterminated list is now an ERROR
    CODE in `_errors` (the key is left ABSENT, never silently empty), and the codes are what the parity fixture
    compares: two readers that reject one note for two different reasons look identical under "it was rejected".

    ⛔ A RUNAWAY IS BOUNDED BY THE NEXT KEY, and that is measured, not assumed. A list left open by a missing
    bracket used to keep eating lines until some later line happened to end in `]` — so `tags: [cobolsharp,

    ⭐ THE FIELD (owner decision 2026-09-19, `kb/Work/PB245`). `inventory_rows` is a note's CLAIM while it is
    open; `closes_rows` is what its landing CLOSED, and it is the back-link the register never had. Without it
    "which rows did this fix close" was answerable only by re-measuring, and fourteen §15 rows held the GAP open
    on mechanisms seven landings had already closed — thirteen of them closed CONFORMS on first re-measurement.

    ⛔ WHAT IS CHECKED HERE, AND WHAT IS NOT — the same division `record_verdicts.py` draws, for the same reason.
    This validates what is decidable from the NOTE alone: the value is a list, each member is SPELLED like a
    rule-id, and a reason that is present is not empty. Whether a named row exists, whether its verdict resolves,
    and whether a landed defect note said anything at all belong to `ClosesRowsBackLinkDriftTests`
    (tests/Cobol.Net.Tests.Unit) — those predicates have to keep holding as the INVENTORY changes underneath a
    note that nobody is editing, so they belong to something that runs every build, and asking them here as well
    would be one rule in two places (`feedback_one_rule_one_place`).
