"""Cross-reference MEASURED underlining against the grammar's keyword spelling, to find optional words we require.

THE DEFECT CLASS. ISO §5.2.3: an uppercase word printed WITHOUT an underline is an OPTIONAL WORD — it may be
written or omitted with no change of meaning. §5.2.2: an underlined one is REQUIRED. That distinction is carried
ENTIRELY by typography, it is the first thing a transcription loses, and a grammar written from a transcription
that lost it will reject legal COBOL.

It has already produced real compiler bugs: `ON` in SIZE ERROR and ON EXCEPTION (DEVLOG 1041), `FROM`, `AFTER`,
`SECONDS` and `TO` in the MCS statements (DEVLOG 1042), `ON` in READ … ADVANCING ON LOCK (kb/Work PB331), and
`WITH` in START … WITH LENGTH plus `AFTER`/`PROCEDURE` in USE (kb/Work PB332). Each was found by hand. This
automates the search.

HOW. For every general format PRINTED IN THE STANDARD — all of them, not the statements alone:

  * the transcription declares the population: every `N.N…  General format[s]` heading in `specs/ISO_COBOL.md`;
  * the PAGE and the EXTENT come from `clause_page.index()`, the one clause→page locator — the format runs from
    its own heading to the NEXT clause heading, across a page break when it takes one;
  * the words in that band are measured — underlined or not — from the PDF's vector rectangles;
  * the grammar rules that spell the construct are its CLOSURE: the rules naming the construct's leading keyword,
    plus every rule reachable from them that NOTHING ELSE references. That closure is what makes helper rules
    visible — `readAdvancingOnLock` never mentions READ, and a keyword-only scan could never have found PB331;
  * a word printed WITHOUT an underline but appearing as a BARE (non-optional) token is reported.

⛔ IT ASSERTS ITS OWN POPULATION, and that assertion is the point. Until 2026-09-05 this tool located its pages
from the markdown's `#page-N` anchors; DE-PAGING DELETED THE ANCHORS, so it located 0 general formats, scanned
0 pages, printed `0 candidate(s)` and exited 0 — a silently green gate over the whole grammar while READ, START
and USE each rejected legal source (kb/Work PB332). Every count below is now checked against the population it
claims to have measured, and a shortfall is a NON-ZERO EXIT, never a clean zero.

WHAT IT CANNOT DECIDE, and deliberately does not pretend to. A word may be required in one format and optional
in another — `TO` is underlined in `ADD … TO` and bare in `SEND … TO`, and `KEY` is underlined in START's KEY
phrase and bare in its INVALID KEY phrase. This tool matches at CONSTRUCT granularity and drops any word that is
underlined ANYWHERE in the construct's formats, so it under-reports rather than over-reports, and what it does
report still needs a human. It reports CANDIDATES, not findings.

⚠ CONFIRM EVERY CANDIDATE AGAINST THE RAW RECTANGLES BEFORE CHANGING THE GRAMMAR. Two-letter words are the
weak case for underline detection — a 9 pt width floor once made this toolchain accuse two CORRECT pages
(`IN` p322, `TO` p673), and acting on that would have damaged the reference document. `figure_extract.py`'s
docstring records the fix; the discipline stands regardless.
