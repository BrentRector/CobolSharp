"""Generate the Obsidian conformance view over the traceability inventory — AGGREGATES, not one note per rule.

⛔ DESIGN CORRECTION. The first version emitted one note per rule: 3,481 files created in a single run, an 82%
increase in the vault's markdown, on top of two ~3 MB indexed documents. It wedged Obsidian mid-sync. The
per-rule frontmatter did buy live Dataview filtering, but that is not worth a 5x vault and a client that will not
open — and the queryable SSOT already exists as JSON, which jq and python query far better than Dataview does.

So the vault view is now the BURN-DOWN, at ~13 notes: a dashboard plus one note per top-level clause. It shows
aggregates and points at the inventory for the full list. Deliberately NOT an exhaustive per-rule enumeration —
3,790 table rows spread over 11 notes would recreate the same problem in a different shape, and the tracker's own
rule for enumerating drift-prone items applies here too.

`kb/Conformance/` is a GITIGNORED build output, so it is never committed. Regenerate freely.

⛔ AND IT WENT STALE, WHICH IS WHY `--check` EXISTS (2026-08-04). Nothing ran this script, so the notes drifted
from the inventory they claim to summarise: five of twelve clause notes were wrong, and §15's said **533 GAP
where the live number was 481** — the dashboard under-reported real progress by 52 rows. A generated view that
nobody regenerates is worse than no view, because it is read as current. Two things now prevent it:
  * `build_inventory.py` regenerates this view in the same run that writes the inventory, so the two cannot
    diverge without someone bypassing both;
  * `--check` rebuilds in memory and diffs against what is on disk, so a gate can FAIL on staleness. It exits 0
    when the directory is absent — that is CI, where a gitignored build output legitimately does not exist, and
    "missing" must not be reported as "stale" (the verdict-evidence invariant, DESIGN-test-build-ci.md §3.10).

    python scripts/spec/gen_conformance_notes.py            # write
    python scripts/spec/gen_conformance_notes.py --check    # non-zero if the notes on disk are stale
