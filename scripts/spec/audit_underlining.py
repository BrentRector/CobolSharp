"""Audit the transcription's UNDERLINING against the printed page, for every general format in the standard.

WHAT IS AT STAKE. §5.2.2 makes an underlined uppercase word REQUIRED; §5.2.3 makes a non-underlined one an
OPTIONAL word that may be written or omitted. Underlining is therefore load-bearing grammar carried entirely by
typography — and it is the detail a transcription loses silently, because losing it changes nothing structural.
Every gate stays green. The repairs so far have repeatedly found words *described* as underlined that are not
(falsely restrictive: a legal omission becomes a syntax error) and words underlined on the page that the
transcription never marks (falsely permissive: a required word looks droppable).

WHY IT CAN BE AUDITED NOW. The PDF's text layer decodes (`pdf_deobfuscate.py`) and underlines are long thin
horizontal rectangles in the vector data, so a word's underline state is a MEASUREMENT — see `figure_extract.py`.

THE SIGNAL IS CLEAN. Underlining is used in this document only for required words in general formats: a prose
page yields zero underlined reserved-word tokens, while page 613 yields exactly the required words of the three
ADD formats. So a mismatch is a real finding rather than noise.

TWO CHECKS, both precise, both able to fail:

  UNMARKED   the page underlines a word, and the markdown page neither wraps it in <u></u> nor mentions it in a
             figure note. The transcription gives no indication the word is required.  -> falsely PERMISSIVE
  OVERMARKED the markdown wraps a word in <u></u>, but no occurrence of that word is underlined on the page.
             The transcription invents a requirement.                                  -> falsely RESTRICTIVE

  MIXED      reported separately, and NOT a defect by itself: the page underlines SOME occurrences of a word and
             not others. `EXCEPTION` on page 653 is the real example — underlined in `EXCEPTION exception-name-1`,
             bare in `LAST EXCEPTION`. Set-based comparison cannot express that, so these need eyes.

DELIBERATE LIMIT. A figure note that *names* a word is treated as "mentioned", not as agreeing about it — the
note's prose is not parsed. That makes UNMARKED conservative: it under-reports rather than crying wolf. Notes are
checked by reading them, which is how the ON/OFF family was repaired.

⚠ KNOWN FALSE-POSITIVE CLASS: TABLES. A table's horizontal ROW BORDER is a long thin rule sitting just under the
row's text, which is geometrically indistinguishable from an underline. On table pages every cell in a bordered
row therefore reads as "underlined" — page 628 shows it plainly, where the footnote markers `c`, `c,f`, `a,c,f`
all come back underlined. Most MIXED results on table-heavy pages (564, 628, and the intrinsic-function summary
pages in the 860-970 range) are this artifact, not a defect. MIXED is a QUEUE FOR INSPECTION, never a finding.

⚠ AND THE BUG THIS TOOL ALREADY MADE, kept here as a warning. Its first run reported two OVERMARKED defects,
`IN` on page 322 and `TO` on page 673 — both wrong. `figure_extract.py` was excluding horizontal rules under
9 pt as bracket feet, and the underline under a two-letter word is 8.4-8.9 pt. The tool was accusing a CORRECT
transcription, and acting on it would have stripped real underlining out of the reference document. Width cannot
separate a foot from an underline; position can. Whenever this tool reports a defect, confirm it against the raw
rectangles before changing anything.
