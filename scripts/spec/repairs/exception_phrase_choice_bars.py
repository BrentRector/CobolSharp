"""Restore the §5.2.6.4 CHOICE INDICATOR bars to the eight exception-phrase figures that lost them.

THE DEFECT, and why it is normative. Every COBOL statement that can fail prints its handler pair inside ONE tall
bracket carrying a pair of vertical bars:

    ⎡|  ON SIZE ERROR imperative-statement-1      |⎤
    ⎣|  NOT ON SIZE ERROR imperative-statement-2  |⎦

Per §5.2.6.4 those bars mean ZERO OR MORE of the enclosed alternatives, each at most once, in any order — so one
statement may carry BOTH handlers. Per §5.2.6.2 a bracket WITHOUT bars means at most one. Dropping the bars
therefore forbids `COMPUTE ... ON SIZE ERROR ... NOT ON SIZE ERROR ... END-COMPUTE`, which is legal COBOL that
every real program writes. This is the falsely-restrictive direction, and a grammar written from the figure
inherits the restriction.

VERIFIED BY MEASUREMENT, not by eye. `scripts/spec/figure_geometry.py` reads the PDF's vector rectangles — the
brackets and bars are drawn objects, so this is immune to the obfuscated text layer that forces everything else
through a render. On every page repaired here the printed geometry is unambiguous, e.g. page 632:

    x= 76.29  h=31.98  feet at both ends  -> '[' bracket stem
    x= 81.19  h=37.58  no feet, taller    -> '|' choice indicator
    x=304.36  h=37.58  no feet, taller    -> '|' choice indicator
    x=309.72  h=31.98  feet at both ends  -> ']' bracket stem

A bracket stem carries short horizontal feet; a choice-indicator bar is a bare rule, drawn slightly taller. The
tool reports `[ | | ]` for all eight groups repaired here.

THE CLASS WAS ENUMERATED BEFORE ANY EDIT. Of the 30 exception-phrase figure sites in the file, 21 already used the
house style and 9 had lost it. Eight are repaired here; the ninth (ACCEPT Format 3, page 607) is LaTeX rather than
ASCII art and its two independent verifiers disagree about the bracketing of the LINE/COLUMN rows, so it is
handled separately rather than guessed at.

The lost bars had degraded into three different wrong shapes, which is why no single find-and-replace would have
found them all: doubled corner glyphs (`⌈⌊ … ⌉⌋`, `⌐⌐ … ¬¬`), a bracket drawn with bare verticals whose bars were
simply deleted (`⌐ … ¬` over `| … |`), and nested plain brackets (`[ [ … ] ]`).
