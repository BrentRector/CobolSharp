"""Draw the Annex D VARYING flowcharts that were never drawn — Figures D.11 and D.13.

WHAT WAS THERE. D.11 was a rough arrow sketch (`→ Condition-1 → True → Exit`, `↑___________|`) and D.13 was
nothing but the chart's labels in reading order. Their siblings D.12 and D.14 ARE drawn, which is the odd
part — whoever drew these did alternate figures and stopped.

THE HOUSE STYLE IS ALREADY SETTLED, by Figure D.8: boxes with CENTRED text, connectors meeting a border at a
`┬`/`┴`/`├` junction rather than ending in a separate arrowhead, and a branch label sitting beside its
connector. Nothing new is invented here; these two are drawn to match what is already in the file.

GEOMETRY IS COMPUTED, NEVER COUNTED. Counting characters by eye is exactly what produced the defects in the
figures that WERE drawn — D.7 has 22 box walls in columns no rule reaches, and D.12's text spills past its own
border (`│  Set identifier-2 to cur- │` inside a 21-wide box). So a box here is sized from its content, every
connector is placed at a computed column, and `put` REFUSES to overwrite a non-blank cell. That guard caught
the first draft drawing its True branch straight through the decision's right wall and its loop line through
the bottom box's border — both of which would have rendered as a plausible-looking picture.

Printed originals: D.11 on folio 1155, D.13 on folio 1157. D.13 is D.11 with the test moved AFTER the body,
which is what TEST AFTER means, so the two differ only in where the decision sits.
