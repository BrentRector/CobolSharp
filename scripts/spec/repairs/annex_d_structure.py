"""Draw the two Annex D illustrations that are STRUCTURE rather than flow — Figures D.3 and D.6.

Neither is a flowchart, which is why neither of the other two generators covers them.

D.3 — Compilation group and run unit structures (printed folio 1044) — is a nested schematic in which the
BORDER WEIGHT is the notation: the printed figure distinguishes four entities purely by how their rectangle
is drawn, and its own Legend says so. Box-drawing has exactly those weights, so the distinction survives the
transcription:

    ┏━━┓  heavy   compilation group · run unit
    ┌──┐  light   compilation unit · source unit · runtime module
    ┌╌╌┐  dashed  source element · runtime element

What the figure SAYS, and what therefore has to survive: containment (a compilation group holds compilation
units, which hold source units, which hold source elements), the example hierarchy P-1 / P-1-1 / P-1-2 /
P-1-2-1 / P-1-2-2, and — the point of the whole diagram — that runtime modules from one compilation group need
not land in the same run unit, and a run unit need not draw from one compilation group. That last part is
carried by the `To other run unit` / `From other comp. group` arrows on the flanking units.

D.6 — Example of page layout (printed folio 1132) — is a PAGE, not a chart: one vertical rule standing for the
edge of the form, the four form positions named down its left, the six PAGE clause phrases down its right, and
the report content beside them. What stood in the transcription was a three-column Markdown table, which loses
the one thing the figure is about: VERTICAL DISTANCE. A table gives every row the same height, so the void in
the middle of the body (the standard's way of saying "and further body groups") and the void between the
logical and the physical bottom of form — the unusable tail of the physical page, which is the whole reason
PAGE LIMIT and the physical form are drawn as different lines — both collapsed to nothing.

So the rows here are placed from the MEASURED printed y of every line, at the page's own 8.7 pt pitch. The
column positions cannot be taken the same way: the printed form labels wrap ("Physical Bottom of" / "Form")
to fit a narrow column, this draws them on one line, and the columns are therefore sized from their content.
The one horizontal position that IS measured is the axis the `<…>` content lines are centred on, which the
printed page sets by tab and this reproduces as a fraction of the content column.
