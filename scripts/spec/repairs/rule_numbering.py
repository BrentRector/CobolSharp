"""De-list the standard's rule hierarchy — `1)` / `a)` / `1.` are LABELS, not list positions.

WHAT WAS WRONG. Every top-level rule was written as `1) …` at column 0, which CommonMark parses as an ORDERED
LIST ITEM. Three things follow, and only the first is cosmetic:

  1. THE MARKER CHANGES. HTML `<ol>` has no per-item delimiter, so the printed `1)` renders as `1.` — and the
     standard prints `1.` for its THIRD level (see the printed page: `1)` → `a)` → `1.`). A top-level rule and
     a third-level sub-item therefore become indistinguishable in the rendered document.
  2. THE DOCUMENT CONTRADICTS ITSELF. `a)` is not a Markdown marker, so the SECOND level always rendered as
     the literal `a)` it is printed as. One structure, two renderings, in the same clause.
  3. ⛔ CONTENT IS DESTROYED. A list item's content is re-parsed as Markdown BLOCK syntax, so a rule beginning
     with `>` opens a blockquote and the `>` is EATEN:
         `3) >>IF conditional-expression-1 shall begin…`  → renders "IF conditional-expression-1 shall begin…"
         `9) >= is an abbreviation for GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO.` → renders "= is an abbreviation for GREATER
            THAN OR EQUAL TO." — which is a FALSE normative statement about `=`.
     Eight rules were affected: six compiler directives (>>IF/>>ELSE/>>END-IF/>>WHEN/>>END-EVALUATE) and two
     relational-operator definitions in §8.7.5.2. A whole-document sweep found `>` to be the ONLY block
     syntax that bites — no rule begins with `#`, `-`, a fence or a pipe — so de-listing is what fixes the
     corruption AND the marker at once, rather than escaping eight `>` and leaving the rest wrong.

WHAT THIS DOES. Escapes the marker so the line is an ordinary paragraph carrying the printed label, and
repairs the two shapes that only survived because they sat INSIDE a list item:

    `1) text`          → `1\\) text`        the label, as printed (4,161)
    `    a) text`      → `   a) text`      4 spaces outside a list is a CODE BLOCK (17)
    `      1. text`    → `   1\\. text`     same, plus the label (93 at 6 spaces, 6 at 3)

`a)` at 0 or 3 spaces is already correct and is not touched. `1.` at column 0 already renders as the printed
`1.` and is left alone — it is its own list either way, since CommonMark starts a new list on a changed
delimiter.
