"""Remove the duplicated printed-page-546 block stranded inside the page-575 slice.

THE DEFECT. The body of printed page 546 (the object-destruction NOTE, §14.6.11 items 5-7, all of §14.6.12
Abnormal run unit termination, and §14.6.13 / .1 / .1.1) is emitted TWICE: once stranded at the end of the
page-575 slice, introduced by a stray horizontal rule and a stray running-header H1, and again in its proper place
under the `page-576` anchor. Four section anchors are therefore emitted twice, and because the stray copy comes
FIRST in file order, every intra-document link and every heading-derived TOC entry resolves to the copy that sits
under the WRONG page anchor. A grep-based citation workflow gets two hits for one rule with no way to tell which
is canonical — and that is precisely how the `spec-lookup` skill reads this file.

WHICH COPY SURVIVES. The one under `<a id="page-576">`. The stray copy has no page anchor of its own, so any
citation resolved through it reports the wrong printed page.

WHY THIS IS SCRIPTED RATHER THAN HAND-EDITED. Deleting the wrong range loses normative content silently. Every
boundary is asserted against its expected text before a single line is removed, so a shifted line aborts the run
instead of shifting the deletion.

A whole-file duplicate scan found exactly ONE artifact of this kind. Eleven other repeated runs were checked and
left alone: ten are distant repetitions separated by several page anchors, and one (the INSPECT worked examples)
is two examples legitimately sharing a code-block header and table header.
