"""Convert the last eight LaTeX general-format diagrams to the house ASCII style, with MEASURED underlining.

WHY THESE EIGHT. The transcription renders 514 general formats as fenced ASCII figures and eight as LaTeX. That
inconsistency is not cosmetic: the ASCII figures carry `Figure notes` blocks recording which words are underlined
and what the delimiters mean, and the LaTeX ones do not — so the notation that §5.2.2/§5.2.3 and §5.2.6 attach
meaning to was being carried in a form nothing checks. ACCEPT Format 3 (page 607) was one of them, and it turned
out to have lost its choice indicators AND to have mis-stated underlining in two places.

EVERY UNDERLINE HERE WAS READ OFF THE PAGE, not carried over from the LaTeX. `figure_extract.py` matches
underline rectangles to individual words; `figure_geometry.py` reports the bracket stems. Two normative defects
fell out that no sweep agent had reported:

  * **page 606, ACCEPT Format 2** — `YYYYMMDD` and `YYYYDDD` are UNDERLINED on the printed page (measured at
    y=571.5 x=242.1 and y=588.8 x=235.7). The LaTeX left them plain, which per §5.2.3 would make them optional
    words that may be omitted — i.e. it implied `ACCEPT x FROM DATE [ ]` is meaningful.

  * **page 653, EXIT Format 2** — in the `LAST EXCEPTION` alternative, `LAST` is underlined and `EXCEPTION` is
    NOT (measured: LAST underlined at y=456.7 x=235.5, EXCEPTION plain at x=263.3). The LaTeX underlined BOTH.
    The identical phrase in the page-661 raising-phrase had it RIGHT, so the two disagreed with each other; the
    measurement settles which. ⚠ This is recorded AS PRINTED and flagged: an un-underlined `EXCEPTION` there is
    hard to read as a true optional word, and it may be a defect in the standard's own typesetting. Recording
    ISO's defects rather than silently "correcting" them is the standing rule.

The other six diagrams were already semantically correct and are converted for form only.
