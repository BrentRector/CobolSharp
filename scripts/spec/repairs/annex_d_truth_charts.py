"""Draw the Annex D condition-evaluation flowcharts — Figures D.7, D.8, D.9, D.10.

THE FAMILY. Each is a chain of `Evaluate condition-N` boxes alternating with a rounded decision, where each
decision's yes/no exits either continue down the chain or leave for a RAIL that runs to one of the two
terminals, `Truth value is true` / `Truth value is false`. Only the decision wording and where each exit goes
differ between them, so one generator draws all three.

  D.7  condition-1 AND condition-2 AND … condition-n     decisions ask `false`; any yes ⇒ false
  D.8  condition-1 OR  condition-2 OR  … condition-n     decisions ask `true`;  any yes ⇒ true
  D.9  condition-1 OR condition-2 AND condition-3        mixed, and the only one using BOTH rails
  D.10 (condition-1 OR NOT condition-2) AND condition-3 AND condition-4   two COLUMNS, drawn separately

D.10 is the exception the shared `chart()` does not cover: the parenthesised OR is decided in the left column
and hands over to a SECOND column of ANDed conditions, whose fallbacks return to the left column's spine. The
columns are not independent, so it has its own function.

WHY IT IS SAFE TO REGENERATE D.8, WHICH WAS ALREADY CORRECT. It is the test. D.8 is the one member of the
family that was drawn properly by hand, so the generator has to reproduce it CHARACTER FOR CHARACTER before
its output for the other two can be trusted — `--verify` asserts exactly that against the file. Without it,
this script would be an untested tool applied to figures nobody has checked.

D.7 was the ragged one: `│Condition-1│` is eleven characters inside a nine-wide box, its rail sits in a column
no rule reaches (22 such walls), and its arrows are `→` rather than box-drawing. D.9 was never drawn at all.

    python scripts/spec/repairs/annex_d_truth_charts.py --verify   # generator reproduces the printed D.8
    python scripts/spec/repairs/annex_d_truth_charts.py            # render all four
