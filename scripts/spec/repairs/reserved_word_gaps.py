"""Split the three run-together lines in §8.9, and gate the list against the printed page.

WHAT WAS WRONG. Eighteen reserved words — OCCURS, OF, THAN, TALLYING, TERMINATE, TEST, TABLE, SYSTEM-DEFAULT,
NUMERIC-EDITED, OBJECT/-COMPUTER/-REFERENCE and six END-* verbs — were not on lines of their own. They sat
COLLAPSED onto three lines, six to a line:

    END-PERFORM END-RECEIVE END-READ END-RETURN END-REWRITE END-SEARCH

which is a printed COLUMN read across instead of down. Every word was present, so a word count could never
find it; what was lost was that each is a separate entry — and the run-together line also puts END-RECEIVE
before END-READ, so the list is not even in the order it claims.

⚠ HOW THIS WAS NEARLY MADE WORSE. Found by diffing the section against `ReservedWords.Table.cs` (410 flagged
ISO-2023, section yielding 392) and independently against the printed pages; both named the same 18. Reading
"missing" literally, the first version of this script INSERTED all eighteen — duplicating every one, because
they were never absent. Caught by the owner reading the applied diff. `reserved_word_list.py` carries a
word-conservation check and would have refused; this script had none, which is exactly why it could not see
that the words it was "restoring" were already on the page. It now has one, and it is the reason the repair
is a SPLIT rather than an insert.
