"""Correct the seven ON/OFF compiler-directive figure notes so they state the printed glyphs accurately.

THE DEFECT. These notes are the transcription's own editorial matter, and they misdescribe the printed page in a
FALSELY RESTRICTIVE direction. Per §5.2.2 an underlined uppercase word is REQUIRED; per §5.2.3 a non-underlined
one is an OPTIONAL word that may be written or omitted. Claiming a word is underlined when it is not turns a legal
omission into an apparent syntax error — and a grammar written from the note inherits that.

VERIFIED AGAINST THE PRINTED PAGES at 300 dpi, figure regions cropped and read:
  LEAP-SECOND (p106) — LEAP-SECOND underlined · ON NOT underlined · OFF underlined
  FLAG-14     (p102) — FLAG-14 and the twelve option names underlined · ALL NOT underlined ·
                       ON NOT underlined · OFF underlined
The `>>` directive indicator is not underlined in either; the rule begins at the directive word.

THE FAMILY IS REPAIRED TOGETHER because the seven notes currently disagree with each other about the same
notation: LEAP-SECOND and FLAG-14 call ON required, REF-MOD-ZERO-LENGTH and TURN correctly call it un-underlined,
LISTING calls it a typesetting omission, and PROPAGATE invents a rule to explain it. Fixing them one at a time
would leave the contradiction, merely relocated.

⛔ PROPAGATE CARRIES AN INVENTED RULE: "In the compiler-directive formats the underlined alternative marks the
default." No such rule exists in the standard. It is falsified by LISTING — OFF is the underlined alternative
there, yet §7.3.18.3 GR2 makes >>LISTING ON the default — and contradicted by the transcription's own POP note.
It is deleted rather than reworded.

WHAT THE NOTES NOW SAY: the glyph facts as printed, plus the §5.2.3 consequence, plus a pointer to the general
rules that presuppose an implied ON. Where the standard's own typesetting is doubtful the note SAYS SO rather
than resolving it silently in either direction — recording ISO's defects is the standing rule, not coding around
them.
