"""Anchor every table and figure caption, and rebuild the front-matter lists to LINK to them.

TWO DEFECTS, one cause — the lists were left keyed to the printed page.

  TABLES   The list carries a `Page` column of printed folios. Pages were removed from this transcription
           because they mean nothing in Markdown; a folio in a list of contents is exactly the reference a
           reader cannot follow.

  FIGURES  Worse than unhelpful: the list was WRONG. Its entries link `D.11` to `#section-d-11`, which is
           CLAUSE D.11 "Character sets" — not Figure D.11, "The VARYING phrase of a PERFORM statement with
           the TEST BEFORE phrase having one condition". Figure numbering and clause numbering are separate
           sequences that happen to share the annex letter, and whatever produced these links matched on the
           number alone. Twelve of the fifteen entries pointed at the wrong place; the other three were not
           links at all, and two printed folios sat orphaned on their own lines.

           The list also had no list markup, so its fifteen entries rendered as one run-on paragraph.

THE FIX is to anchor the captions themselves. Every table and figure in the body carries a bold caption —
`**Table 10 — …**`, `**Figure D.11 — …**` — so each gets an `<a id="table-10">` / `<a id="figure-d-11">`
immediately above it, and the lists are rebuilt from those captions. The list can then no longer disagree with
the document, because it is GENERATED FROM it rather than maintained beside it.
