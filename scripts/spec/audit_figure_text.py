"""Audit the WORDS of every printed general format against the transcription.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `audit_underlining.py` checks the notation (which words are required) and
`figure_geometry.py` checks the delimiters (bracket, brace, choice indicator). Neither checks the thing
underneath both: whether the transcription got the figure's WORDS right. That matters more here than anywhere
else in the document, because `specs/ISO_COBOL.md` was produced by sending each page IMAGE to a vision model —
every word in it is a transcription of a picture, and a general format is exactly the kind of dense, low-context
layout such a model is most likely to guess at.

WHAT IT COMPARES. For each PDF page, the tokens printed on FIGURE lines; against every token anywhere in that
page's markdown. Reporting "printed but nowhere on the markdown page" rather than "not inside a fence" is
deliberate — the transcription renders some general formats fenced and some inline with `<u>` tags, and the
question worth asking is whether the content SURVIVED, not which style carried it.

FIGURE LINES are separated from prose by their lower-case words: in a general format every lower-case term is
hyphenated (`identifier-1`, `rounded-phrase`, `imperative-statement-2`), while prose is full of plain words like
"the" and "statement". Running headers are dropped explicitly, and layout labels ("Format", "General") are
ignored because the transcription places them outside the figure.

HYPHENATION IS RECONCILED, NOT COUNTED. The PDF breaks long hyphenated terms across lines, so `B-SHIFT-LC` is
printed as `B-SHIFT` + `LC` and `method-name-1` as `method-` + `name-1`. A missing token that is a prefix or
suffix of a token present in the markdown is therefore reported separately as a line-break artifact rather than
as content loss. Without this the report is dominated by noise that looks exactly like real findings.
