"""Measure the DELIMITER GEOMETRY of the printed general-format figures, straight from the PDF's vector data.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The reconciliation sweep repeatedly had to decide whether a printed figure carries the §5.2.6.4
CHOICE INDICATOR — a pair of vertical bars just inside a bracket or brace — because the difference is normative:

    [  A / B  ]     per §5.2.6.2   at most ONE of A, B
    [ |A / B| ]     per §5.2.6.4   ZERO OR MORE of A, B, each at most once, in any order
    {  A / B  }     per §5.2.6.3   exactly ONE of A, B
    { |A / B| }     per §5.2.6.4   ONE OR MORE of A, B, each at most once, in any order

Dropping the bars turns legal COBOL into apparently illegal COBOL, which is the falsely-restrictive loss this
whole effort is hunting. Until now that call was made by rendering the page and squinting at it — slow, and a
judgement call at exactly the point where a wrong judgement silently corrupts the grammar.

It does not have to be a judgement call. The brackets and the bars are VECTOR RECTANGLES in the PDF content
stream, so they can be MEASURED. Crucially this is immune to the obfuscated text layer (the fonts carry shifted
cmaps, which is why `render-spec-page.py` exists at all) — vector geometry has no encoding to obfuscate.

HOW A BAR IS TOLD FROM A BRACKET. A bracket stem carries short horizontal FEET at one or both ends, turning
inward; a choice-indicator bar is a bare vertical rule with no feet, and is drawn slightly TALLER than the bracket
it sits inside. Measured on page 632, the ON SIZE ERROR group of COMPUTE Format 1:

    x= 76.29  h=31.98  feet at both ends, turning right   -> '[' bracket stem
    x= 81.19  h=37.58  no feet, taller                    -> '|' choice indicator
    x=304.36  h=37.58  no feet, taller                    -> '|' choice indicator
    x=309.72  h=31.98  feet at both ends, turning left    -> ']' bracket stem

A foot is distinguished from an UNDERLINE (which marks a required word, §5.2.2) by length: feet are 2-8 pt and
start at the stem's own x, underlines are far longer and sit under text.

CAVEAT, stated because it bounds what this tool may be used for. Curly braces are typeset as FONT GLYPHS, not
rects, so a brace does not appear in the vector data at all. This tool therefore reports bars and brackets with
certainty, and infers a brace only from a bar that has no bracket around it. When the enclosing delimiter matters,
render the page. What the tool is authoritative about is the BARS — and those are what the sweep keeps losing.
