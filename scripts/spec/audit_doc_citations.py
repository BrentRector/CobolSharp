    python scripts/spec/audit_doc_citations.py --self-test  # prove the check FAILS on a known defect

⛔ WHAT THIS LOOKS FOR, AND WHY IT IS NARROW ON PURPOSE. CLAUDE.md rule 1: "The failure mode is not inventing a
citation, it is INHERITING one — a queue entry or design doc carries a §, its quoted text is genuinely in the
standard, and the clause NUMBER is never re-derived before it propagates." That defect has an exact mechanical
signature: the quoted text IS in the spec, and it is NOT in the clause the doc names.

⛔ A CITATION IS WRITTEN IN MORE THAN ONE ORDER, AND ASSUMING ONE OF THEM IS HOW THIS AUDIT ACCUSED FOUR CORRECT
SITES (kb/Work PB379). The first version anchored on the § and took the next quote on the line — i.e. it could
read `§15.39.1 "depends on the type of argument-1"` and nothing else. This repository also writes:

  · the POSTFIX form, `"depends on the type of argument-1" §15.39.1,` — the citation follows what it supports.
    Of PB379's six reported "misfilings" TWO were this: the prefix reading blamed whichever § happened to sit
    nearest BEFORE the quote, which was the PREVIOUS quote's citation. Worse than the false positives was the
    blind spot behind them — a quote cited in the postfix form was never checked against its clause AT ALL, so a
    misfiling written that way was invisible. Reading both orders removed the false positives and put ~15 more
    citations under the check.
  · the BACK-REFERENCE form, `§15.2 … "no digits to the right of the decimal point" (item 5)` — the clause is
    named earlier in the sentence and the quote points back at it by rule number. That one is NOT made
    mechanical here and is not meant to be: a citation no tool can resolve is a citation nothing checks, which
    is the state rule 1 exists to end. The repair is to write the clause number next to the quote it supports.

THE ORDER RULE, then: the citation of a quoted fragment is the clause that FOLLOWS it and closes (a bracket, a
comma, a full stop, a `/` or `·` in a citation list) if there is one, else the nearest clause BEFORE it on the
same line. A `§` that opens an aside instead of closing — `"…the NATIONAL phrase" (§13.18.29 — and my first
draft cited …)` — is deliberately not read as the quote's citation: it is a pointer at a construct the quote
NAMES, and reading it as the source accused kb/Work PB15, which is correct.

⚠ THE SIGNAL IS SHARP, NOT PERFECT, and the first run proved it — do not treat a hit as a defect without reading
the line. `--find` reports the first clause containing the text, and a phrase can legitimately appear in several;
a doc may also name two clauses in one sentence, or quote a defined TERM rather than spec prose. The patterns
below are calibrated against both, and every remaining hit still deserves a human glance before an edit.

⚠ THE BROAD VERSION OF THIS CHECK IS WORTHLESS, and it was written first. Matching every `§N.N … "quoted text"`
pair and demanding the text be inside that clause reported 133 failures out of 183, essentially all of them its
own fault: quotes captured across a markdown blockquote marker, paraphrases attributed to a clause, quoted LABELS
(`"shall-not-with-APPLY-COMMIT"`, `"element; para; line"`) that were never claims about spec text at all, and
`§1.6`-style references to a DOC's own sections. A doc uses quotation marks for both quoting and naming, and
nothing in the text distinguishes them — so that check cannot be made precise and is not offered as a gate.
It survives behind `--all`, clearly labelled, because the residue is worth eyeballing occasionally.

This is the same lesson the figure audits taught (`plan §0`: "MY CHECKERS WERE BUGGIER THAN THE TRANSCRIPTION" —
76 findings went to 1 as three tool bugs came out). Confirm a measured defect before changing anything.

FOUND BY THE FIRST RUN (all corrected in the same change set):
  · `COBOLNET_DESIGN.md` cited "§12.3.7 GR7 k3 … distinct ascending" TWICE — a phrase that appears NOWHERE in the
    standard. A Phase-B agent inherited it into a fix-queue finding. The real rule is §12.3.7.4 GR7 1.3.
  · `COBOLNET_REDEFINES_DESIGN.md` cited §13.18.60 for GR4/GR11 text really in §13.18.60.4 — one level short,
    the CA37/CA38 shape.
  · `PHASE-11-scout-notes.md` cited §13.18.62 for text really in §13.18.63.4 GR4c.

#: A quoted fragment that could be spec prose: lower-case opening (so a sentence-initial capital, which a doc
#: would have had to re-case, is not read as a verbatim quotation) and long enough to be prose rather than a
#: label. ⚠ A 30-character floor, not 18, and it was earned: below that a quote is usually a defined TERM
#: ("implementor-defined", "the end of the PERFORM"), and a term legitimately appears in many clauses — so
#: --find locating it elsewhere says nothing about the clause the doc named.
QUOTED = r'["“](?P<q>[a-z][^"”\n]{30,90})["”]'

#: FORM 1 — the citation PRECEDES the quote: `§14.9.7.3 SR2: "this statement shall not …"`.
#: ⚠ `[^§"“\n]` between the clause and the quote — NOT `[^"“\n]`. A sentence may name two clauses before it
#: quotes ("never the §13.18.38 window — §14.2.3 GR8 says …"), and the citation being made is the NEAREST one.
#: The greedy form blamed the wrong clause and reported a CORRECT citation as misfiled.
PAT = re.compile(r'§(?P<cl>\d+(?:\.\d+){2,})[^§"“\n]{0,80}' + QUOTED)

#: FORM 2 — the citation FOLLOWS the quote and CLOSES it off: `"depends upon the argument types" §15.18.1)`.
#: Three calibrations, each of which stops this form from reading something that is not a citation:
#:  · `(?!\.\d)` — the clause number is taken WHOLE. Without it the greedy number backtracks against the
#:    `.`-in-the-terminator alternative and `§12.3.7.3 SR16g / SR17d` reads as a citation of §12.3.7 — a
#:    correct citation reported as one level short, which is the very defect shape this audit hunts.
#:  · a rule designator may sit between the clause and the terminator (`§14.9.7.3 SR2)`, `§15.2 item 5)`).
#:  · the citation must CLOSE — bracket, comma, stop, or the `/` and `·` of a citation list. A `§` followed by
#:    more prose is an aside about a construct the quote names, not the quote's source (see the order rule).
POST = re.compile(QUOTED + r'\s{0,2}[(\[]?(?:ISO\s+)?§\s?(?P<cl>\d+(?:\.\d+){2,})(?!\.\d)'
                  r'(?:\s+(?:SR|GR|item|rule)\s?\d+[a-z]?\)?)?\s*(?:[)\],.;:/·]|$)')

#: Marks that a "quote" is elided, marked up, or otherwise not verbatim — never a checkable citation.
#: ⚠ BOTH SPELLINGS OF THE ELLIPSIS, and the ASCII one was missing until the ELIDED arm measured its absence.
#: `"minimum ... logical record size in bytes"` (`FixedFileAttributes.cs:34`) and `"the first reference ... in
#: the run unit"` (`kb/Work/PB307`'s title) are authors marking an elision HONESTLY — exactly what `…` means
#: here — and the new arm reported both as defects because this tuple knew only U+2026. A convention that
#: depends on which of two identical-looking characters the author typed is not a convention.
NOT_VERBATIM = ("…", "...", ">", "*", "`")

#: ⛔ AND A MISFILING THAT IS BEING REPORTED AS A MISFILING IS NOT A DEFECT. The kb/Work note for this family is
#: a table of "this file says §X, the text is really in §Y"; every row spells a wrong pairing, on purpose, and
#: no per-line disclaimer survives being tabulated — the row IS `§8.6.6 | "shall not be specified …"`. A file may
#: declare itself with the marker below, which says "the § / quote pairings in here are QUOTED, not asserted".
#: It is a whole-file opt-out, it is visible in the file, and it is the same mechanism (and the same 40-line
#: window) `audit_code_citations.py` gives the note that names phantom clauses on purpose.
MARKER = "audit-doc-citations: names-misfilings"


#: ⛔ THE ELIDED-QUOTATION ARM (kb/Work PB900). A quotation that `--find` locates NOWHERE lands in `absent`,
#: which is the bucket this audit deliberately does not gate on: a doc quotes LABELS and paraphrases as well
#: as spec text and nothing distinguishes them. But ONE shape inside that bucket IS decidable — a quotation
#: that is the clause's OWN SENTENCE WITH WORDS DROPPED. `EmitterState.cs:29` and `ControlFlowEmitter.cs:70`
#: carried §14.9.14.4 GR5a as *"the most closely preceding, unterminated inline PERFORM"*; the standard says
#: *"the most closely preceding, and as yet unterminated, inline PERFORM"*. Right clause, right rule,
#: quotation marks around words the standard does not contain in that order — and BOTH audits reported zero
#: on it for as long as it shipped. A paraphrase cannot pass this test: its words do not appear IN ORDER
#: inside the clause. A LABEL cannot either. Only an elision can, which is what makes the arm gateable.
#: `SLACK` is what "with words dropped" is allowed to mean: the window in the standard that carries the
#: quote's words in order may be half again as long, plus three. Below `FLOOR` words a subsequence match is
#: a coincidence rather than a quotation, and that floor is what keeps an ordinary phrase out.
