"""Emit a verdict BATCH FILE from a `derived-verdicts` selector — the Python half of the shared predicate.

⛔ WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS AT ALL, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SECOND COPY OF THE PREDICATE. `inventory-schema.json`'s
`derived-verdicts` $comment has claimed since kb/Work PB198 that "the batch generator (Python) and the drift test
(C#) read the SAME predicate" — the whole justification for writing a selector as DATA rather than as code. That
was **false**: a grep for `derived-verdicts` across the repo returned this schema, `DerivedVerdictDriftTests.cs`
and some prose, and NOTHING under `scripts/`. The PB198 batch of sixteen rows was produced by hand, so the second
reader that makes the data-shape worth its cost did not exist, and three of the six A.4 module refuters found
that independently on the same day. The evaluator lives in `inventory_schema.py` (`DerivedSelector`); this file
is only a CLI over it, and the C# `DerivedVerdictDriftTests.Select` is the other engine. Neither carries a
selector.

⛔ THE SAFETY PROPERTY THIS SCRIPT OWNS, AND IT IS THE ONLY ONE `record_verdicts.py` CANNOT. A derived verdict is
sound exactly when the determination it derives from makes every selected rule UNREACHABLE — so a selector that
lands on a row already adjudicated CONFORMS, PARTIAL or DIVERGES has not found a new row, it has CONTRADICTED a
human reading of the code, silently, in a batch of three hundred. `record_verdicts.py` reports such a rewrite
(`⚠ n row(s) RE-ADJUDICATED`) but still applies it, which is right for an adjudication batch and wrong for this
one. Here it is a HARD FAILURE and nothing is written. A selected row may be blank, or may already carry the
selector's own verdict (agreement — the PB198 cross-check running in the reassuring direction); anything else
means the selector or the determination is wrong, and the answer is to re-derive, never to overwrite.

⛔ AND `--self-test` IS PART OF THE MECHANISM, NOT A CONVENIENCE. Two of the arm fields (`requirement`,
`determination-prefix`, added for kb/Work PB280 Q1) cannot be falsified against the live catalog and register —
all 30 A.1-optional items and all 47 §7 rows agree today, so a predicate that had dropped one of them selects
the same rows and leaves the C# drift test green. `--self-test` drives each axis against a FABRICATED catalog
and a FABRICATED register, one broken thing at a time, and `DerivedVerdictDriftTests` shells it every build.

⛔ AND THE ROWS DO NOT CLOSE. DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT `resolves`, but `state_for` still demands a SPEC-DERIVED
test, because the schema closes a declined row only on evidence that the documented posture is what ACTUALLY
happens (see the schema's $verdict-vs-state). Every row a derived batch stamps stays a GAP until its module's
witness lands. This script prints the projected GAP delta — expected ZERO — so that is visible at generation
time rather than discovered as a disappointment after the merge.

    ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT THE C# DRIFT TEST'S JOB. `DerivedVerdictDriftTests` asserts each
    selector against the LIVE catalog and the LIVE register, which is the right check for a selector that has
    landed — and it is powerless over an axis the live data cannot separate. The two axes kb/Work PB280 Q1 added
    are exactly that case: today all 30 A.1-optional items and all 47 §7 rows agree, so every one of the four
    combinations that ought to discriminate collapses onto the same two rows, and a predicate that had dropped
    `requirement` altogether, or matched any determination at all, would select the same set and stay green.
    A MISSING observation is not a NEGATIVE one (`feedback_verdict_evidence_invariant`), so the axes are driven
    here against a FABRICATED catalog and a FABRICATED register, one broken thing at a time.
