"""PHASE A of the spec-conformance review — build the rule catalog (THE DENOMINATOR).

`docs/rearchitecture/DESIGN-spec-conformance-review.md` defines P14 Step-0 DONE as every normative ISO/IEC
1989:2023 rule having a located implementation, a spec-verified verdict, and a spec-derived test. None of that is
measurable without first enumerating the rules — the thing the two prior audits never did (they were bounded
SAMPLING). This script produces that enumeration.

The spec transcription is regular enough to parse directly:

    <a id="section-8-4-3-13-3"></a>
    ## 8.4.3.13.3 Syntax rules

    1) Identifier-1 shall be of category alphanumeric or national.
    2) ...
       a) sub-item
       b) sub-item

So a rule is (section-number, kind, ordinal) and its text runs to the next ordinal or heading.

COMPLETENESS IS THE WHOLE POINT: an omitted rule is silent false confidence — the catalog would report a
denominator smaller than reality and every later percentage would be wrong in the flattering direction. So the
script self-checks: every rule-block heading in the file must yield at least one rule, and any that yields zero is
reported as a PARSE GAP rather than silently dropped.

Usage:
    python scripts/spec/extract_rule_catalog.py                 # write the catalog + print the summary
    python scripts/spec/extract_rule_catalog.py --check         # parse only; non-zero exit if gaps exist

# Sub-items ("a)") are indented and stay with their parent rule.

# optional here so the catalog reads both forms: this regex is the DENOMINATOR of the P14 traceability
# inventory, and a silent zero-rule extraction would read as "no rules in this clause" rather than as a break.
# ⛔ The DELIMITER FORM (")" vs ".") is captured because it is load-bearing (fix-queue PB39): §15.68.3 writes its
# top-level rules `1\)` … and its nested list `1.` …, and the form — not any arithmetic on the ordinals — is what

# of some nested lists onto column 0 (§14.9.13.4 GR4a is transcribed with items 1-3 indented and items 4-6 at
# column 0), and a column-0 ordinal that CONTINUES the most recent indented run is that nested list's tail — not
# a top-level rule. §15.30.3 / §15.31.3 / §15.95.4 each carried such a tail filed as a top-level rule; §15.95.4's
# own heading ("Returned value rule", singular) says the clause has exactly ONE.

# The rule-block kinds the standard uses. Intrinsic functions use argument/returned-value rules instead of SR/GR.
# SINGULAR forms are load-bearing, not a nicety: the standard writes "Syntax rule" when a block holds exactly one
# (§10.6.3, §11.9.4, §13.4.3, …). A plural-only map skipped 15 whole blocks — invisible to the empty-block check,
# because a block that is never RECOGNISED is never counted as seen. The TOC cross-check below is what caught it.
# ⛔ KEYED ON THE SINGULAR CANONICAL FORM ONLY — every plural variant is normalised into it by `kind_of`.
# The literal-spelling map came back a SECOND time: it carried "argument rules"/"argument rule" and still missed
# §15.10.3, §15.13.3 and §15.100.3, which the standard heads "Argument**s** rule(s)". Ten normative rules were
# absent from the denominator, and the burn-down was measuring against a total that was short — the exact "silent
# false confidence" DESIGN-spec-conformance-review.md §7 names. Adding two more spellings would have set up the
# third occurrence, so the pluralisation is now normalised away and the unrecognised-heading check below fails loudly
# on any rule-shaped heading this map does not know.
#
# ⛔ "Editing rules" AND "Precedence rules" ARE NOT A THIRD AND FOURTH KIND — the standard classifies them

#   §5.3.2  "The rules of the PICTURE clause specified in 13.18.40.6, Precedence rules, are syntax rules."
# (both validated with `scripts/spec/cite.py --check`). So this is the SAME defect class as the pluralisation
# above — a heading spelling the map did not know — not a change to what the denominator MEANS. 17 rules, all
# core PICTURE editing: 15 GR + 2 SR. Owner decision 2026-07-30.
# §5.3 "Rules" itself stays OUT and is the reason the two above come in: it is the clause that DEFINES the
