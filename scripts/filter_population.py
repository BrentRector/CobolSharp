"""filter_population.py — EVERY TERM of a vstest `--filter` must name a real test (kb/Work PB708).

`build-local.{ps1,sh}` already refuse a leg that prints no `Passed!`/`Failed!` verdict line — the guard added
after the `--filter "~X|~Y"` lesson (a term without a property matches NOTHING and exits 0). That guard is
WHOLE-FILTER: it fires only when EVERY term is dead. One dead term OR'd among live ones still selects the
others, still prints a verdict line, and is never named. PB691's gate ran

    FullyQualifiedName~CorpusManifest|FullyQualifiedName~SpecTraceabilityInventory

against the Conformance assembly on every run and reported `Passed! … 1640` every time; the test with that name
is `SpecTraceabilityInventoryDriftTests`, which lives in Unit — the assembly build-local runs UNFILTERED. Its
implementer, its finisher and everyone who copied that filter forward believed the inventory drift test had gone
through the gate's filter. Nothing had.

A gate filter is a CLAIM about which tests ran, so the population assertion belongs per (term, assembly), not
per invocation: `feedback_verdict_evidence_invariant` ("a run must assert its population") and
`feedback_measure_the_selectors_complement` ("a selector is evidence about what it RETURNED, never about what
it dropped").

TWO OUTCOMES, because the two failures do different harm and a guard that cries wolf gets worked around:

  DEAD  the name matches nothing in ANY assembly the invocation runs — a typo or a renamed test. The subject
        the filter claims to cover was never tested by anything. ⛔ The gate does not run.
  INERT the name matches no test in the FILTERED assembly but does match in one the invocation runs WITHOUT
        the filter, so the term selected nothing and could not have. This is PB691 exactly. Those tests DID
        run, so the gate proceeds — but the term is named, and the caller stamps the verdict line, because
        the harm in PB691 was a verdict line that read clean while a false claim travelled with it.

⛔ VSTEST OWNS ITS OWN FILTER LANGUAGE AND THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT RE-IMPLEMENT IT. Each term is handed back to
`dotnet test --list-tests --filter <term>` and vstest answers. Modelling the terms in Python against the
`--list-tests` output is measurably WRONG: those are DISPLAY names carrying theory arguments
(`…DayOfWeek_MondayIs1_SundayIs7(clock: "2026-06-08T09:00:00", expected: "1")`) while `FullyQualifiedName`
carries none — `--filter FullyQualifiedName~clock` selects 1 test in Conformance where the display names contain
"clock" dozens of times, so a substring model would have CLEARED a term vstest calls dead, which is the exact
false-green this guard exists to end. Discovery costs ~1.6 s per term against an already-built tree.

A NEGATED term (`!~X`, `!=X`) is probed through its POSITIVE form: asking vstest for `!~X` returns every test in
the assembly and would call a stale exclusion live, whereas the question that matters is whether the name X is
real at all.

Usage (the wave-local gate applies its filter to ONE assembly and runs the other two unfiltered):

    python scripts/filter_population.py --filter "<expanded filter>" \
        --filtered tests/Cobol.Net.Tests.Conformance \
        --unfiltered tests/Cobol.Net.Tests.Unit --unfiltered tests/Cobol.Net.Tests.Characterization

  exit 0  every term is live in a filtered assembly — each term's count is printed, which IS the population
          evidence the run needs to assert
  exit 1  ⛔ DEAD FILTER TERM(S) — the caller must not run the gate
  exit 2  the discovery itself failed — an error, never a finding (a MISSING observation is not a negative one)
  exit 3  ⛔ INERT FILTER TERM(S) — the caller may run the gate and must stamp its verdict line

`--self-test` proves every arm FIRES before the guard is trusted (`feedback_prove_the_watchdog_fails`): the live
arm, the dead arm, the mixed `live|dead` filter that is PB708 itself (the shape the whole-filter guard passes),
the dead-negative arm, the INERT arm built from a name that really is Unit-only, and the exit-2 arm that must
not masquerade as a finding. Every name it uses is DERIVED from what the assemblies discover, so the self-test
cannot rot into asserting against a term that stopped existing.
