# THE COMPILER UNDER TEST for the NIST guard legs — ONE place that answers "which compiler is this gate
# measuring?", SOURCED by scripts/guard.sh, scripts/guard-fast.sh and scripts/run-suite.sh.
#
#   . "$(dirname "$0")/guard-compiler.sh"
#   guard_select_compiler          # sets GUARD_COMPILER + the four paths below, and ASSERTS the identity
#
# scripts/guard-run-group.sh and scripts/guard-compile.sh do NOT source it: they are per-group / per-program
# workers spawned by a guard that has already made the selection, so they READ the exported GUARD_RUNTIME_DLL /
# GUARD_CLI_DLL + GUARD_COMPILER instead. A worker that re-resolved would be a second place the answer lives.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS (kb/Work/PB750). Until 2026-09-06 both guards hard-coded
#     CLI="src/CobolSharp.CLI/bin/Debug/net10.0/cobolsharp.dll"
# and drove the whole 376-program NIST compile-and-run leg — plus its audit and its forensics — through it.
# That binary is the LEGACY byte engine: its dependency closure is CobolSharp.Compiler -> Cobol.Net.Frontend,
# and `Cobol.Net.Compiler` (the Roslyn code generator that IS COBOL.NET) is not in it. So every battery's
# headline `guard NIST: 353 MATCH, 0 REGRESSION(S)` was a true statement about the ORACLE and said nothing
# whatever about the compiler this project ships. Battery #58 proved it the hard way: `NC215A` printed a
# wrong answer (PB741) that the Conformance assembly's NistDifferentialTests partitions caught and the guard's
# NIST leg — 353 MATCH, audit CLEAN — could not see, because the two runs drove two different compilers.
# CLAUDE.md rule 1 names the legacy a regression net with known holes, never authority; a gate pointed at it
# is `feedback_green_gates_arent_evidence` in its purest form.
#
# THE MODEL. The guard drives the compiler this project ships, `cobol` (src/Cobol.Net.Cli), by default. The
# legacy compiler is still runnable through the SAME leg, but only through the project's existing opt-in
# differential switch:
#
#   bash scripts/guard-fast.sh                          -> COBOL.NET  (the gate)
#   COBOLSHARP_LEGACY_DIFFERENTIAL=1 bash scripts/guard-fast.sh   -> the legacy oracle (a differential run)
#
# and every verdict line NAMES the compiler it drove, so a pasted `NIST (cobol): ...` line can never again be
# read as evidence about the other one.
#
# ⛔ AND THE SELECTION IS ASSERTED AGAINST THE BINARY, NOT TRUSTED. `guard_assert_compiler_identity` reads the
# resolved CLI's own `.deps.json` — the build's record of its project graph — and refuses to run when the
# closure does not match the compiler the guard says it is driving. A path typo, a stale bin directory or a
# future project rename can therefore no longer silently re-point this gate at the other compiler.
# `bash scripts/guard-compiler.sh --self-test` proves BOTH directions of that refusal actually fire.

# ── Selection ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Outputs (globals):
#   GUARD_COMPILER      cobol | legacy — the name that goes in every verdict line
#   GUARD_CLI_PROJECT   the .csproj the guard builds
#   GUARD_CLI_BIN       the built output directory (guard.sh snapshots this whole directory)
#   GUARD_CLI_DLL       the managed entry point the guard invokes as `dotnet "$GUARD_CLI_DLL" ...`
#   GUARD_RUNTIME_DLL   the COBOL runtime the compiled programs bind to (copied next to a program before it runs)
#   GUARD_DIVERGENT     1 iff the LEGACY_DIVERGENT exemption list applies (legacy only — see below)
#
# TWO WAYS TO ASK FOR THE LEGACY ARM, and they are not equivalent — say which you mean:
#   GUARD_COMPILER=legacy bash scripts/guard-fast.sh          changes ONLY this NIST leg's compiler
#   COBOLSHARP_LEGACY_DIFFERENTIAL=1 bash scripts/guard-fast.sh   ALSO switches CobolSharp.Tests.Integration's
#       `ConformanceTests` into their opt-in legacy-differential corpus (that assembly reads the same variable —
#       ConformanceTests.cs:41), so the guard's Integration leg then runs a DIFFERENT, much larger population
#       against the byte engine. That is a separate gate with its own verdict; do not read its result as
#       anything about the NIST leg. Measured: it turns ~1276 Integration cases into ~1289 with ~483 failures,
#       because the greenfield conformance corpus has grown post-85 cases the frozen engine cannot compile.
