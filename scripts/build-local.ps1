# build-local.ps1 — the PER-COMMIT wave-local gate, as one command (kb/Work PB108; plan §0 "Gates"; the pwsh twin of
# build-local.sh): build the SOLUTION (Debug — the same binaries battery.sh PHASE 0 builds; a stale test-bin compiler
# DLL hides regressions, so no --no-build leg ever runs on an unbuilt tree), then Conformance filtered on the SUBJECT
# of the change, full Unit (~2 min), Characterization. NOT the comprehensive gate (battery.sh), NOT guard-fast.sh,
# NOT Release (the Windows CI leg). ⛔ The filter is REQUIRED: the wave-local gate is a filter chosen from what the
# change TOUCHES ("~Arithmetic|~Inspect"; add "~VersionMatrix" for an edition gate) — a default would re-create the
# PB36 mistake of filtering on where the new goldens sat. Shorthand terms ("~X|~Y") are expanded to
# FullyQualifiedName~X|FullyQualifiedName~Y — vstest silently matches NOTHING for a bare "~X" (and exits 0), so a leg
# with NO verdict line is RED here, never green by absence. That check is WHOLE-filter, so EVERY TERM is
# additionally put back to vstest before the legs run (scripts/filter_population.py, kb/Work PB708): a term
# naming no test anywhere is DEAD and the gate does not run; one whose tests live only in an assembly this
# gate runs UNFILTERED is INERT — it selected nothing, so it is named and the verdict line says so.
# Usage:  pwsh scripts/build-local.ps1 -Filter "~Collation|~Locale"
#         pwsh scripts/build-local.ps1 -Filter "~X" -Priority BelowNormal     (every IMPLEMENTER gate)
# ⛔ -Priority (owner decision 2026-09-22): the LANDER's gate is the serial bottleneck of the whole campaign and it
# shares one 32-core host with up to seventeen implementer gates — its whole-Conformance leg measured 9.6 min quiet,
# 18.5 min at battery #84 and 30.6 min in train 48. Windows passes BelowNormal/Idle DOWN to child processes (and
# only those two classes), so an implementer that sets it here runs its build, dotnet test, every testhost and every
# compiled COBOL program below the lander's Normal-priority gate. The lander and the battery leave it at Normal.
