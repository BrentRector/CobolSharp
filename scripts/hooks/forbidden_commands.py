"""PreToolUse hook — BLOCK the shell commands this repo's rules forbid, with the reason fed back to the agent.

Owner decision 2026-09-25 (tooling recommendation 2): prose rules are forgotten, a hook is not, and a PreToolUse hook
fires inside subagents and Workflow agents too. Each rule below was written in a skill or memory AND broken anyway:

  git stash / --autostash   the stash stack is SHARED by every linked worktree (common git dir); PB713's implementer
                            popped the registrar's stash. WIP goes into a commit (workstream §3).
  bare push to main         main requires the ci-gate check; the only route is `bash scripts/push-main.sh`
                            (owner decision Q23, 2026-09-06). A push to ci/<sha> or any other branch is fine.
  escapes in a heredoc      heredoc bodies with backslash escapes were mangled or mis-escaped in six sessions (and the
                            harness decodes some escapes in tool input); write the file with the Write tool instead.
  bare `~X` test filter     `--filter "~X|~Y"` matches NOTHING and exits 0 — a silent green; every term needs a
                            property (FullyQualifiedName~X).
  unredirected filtered     a filtered `dotnet test` whose output is neither redirected nor piped floods the context
  dotnet test               and hides the verdict line; log it and read the verdict line (the gate skill).

Exit 2 blocks the call and returns stderr to the agent. Anything unparseable passes (a hook must never wedge a session).
