"""PreToolUse hook — REFUSE to build or test while a subagent fleet is live IN THE CALLER'S OWN WORKING TREE.

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-04 a ten-agent measurement fan-out was dispatched over the §15 result-type
population, and the fix for what it was measuring was then implemented WHILE IT RAN: ~6 `dotnet build`
invocations plus both test gates, over ~1.75 h and 60 agents. Its finders probed a binary that changed under
them and its refuters re-ran probes against a tree where the defects were already fixed, so not one of its
verdicts was usable. One build even failed outright with `MSB3027: cobol.exe locked by another process` — a live
agent — and that alarm was recorded as "transient" and the building continued.

The owner's correction: each repetition wasted tokens. Memory alone did not stop it, so the guard is mechanical.

⚖ THE RULE IT ENFORCES is the ORDER of two decisions, not just the concurrency:
  1. Measure INLINE first. A fan-out for work an inline probe already did is pure waste — PB15's entire
     population was derived and measured in three tool calls before the fleet was ever dispatched.
  2. Once a fleet IS running, THE TREE IT IS PROBING is FROZEN. Build/test only after the completion signal, or
     stop the fleet.

⚖ THE UNIT OF THE FREEZE IS THE WORKING TREE, NOT THE SESSION (2026-09-01). The guard originally denied a build
whenever ANY other agent of this session was live, which is the right harm model applied at the wrong scope: the
harm is "my build changes the binaries THAT agent is executing", and two agents in two `git worktree` checkouts
share no `bin/obj`, no `cobol.exe` and no source. Keying on the session therefore denied a build that could not
collide with anything, and with the owner's 2026-09-01 direction for MAXIMUM SUBAGENT PARALLELISM in the fix
lane that false denial became the binding constraint: N implementer agents in N worktrees serialized behind each
other's liveness. So the guard now denies iff some FOREIGN live agent is working in the SAME tree as the caller.

Both trees in that comparison are DERIVED, never listed — a hand-maintained map of agent→tree is exactly the
shape rule 5 forbids, and it would go stale the first time the host renamed a directory:
  • the CALLER's tree = the repository root of the payload's `cwd` — the nearest ancestor holding a `.git`
    entry, which is a DIRECTORY in the main checkout and a FILE in a worktree. Stopping at the FIRST one is
    what makes a worktree resolve to itself rather than to the repository it was cut from (`repo_root_of`).
  • the MAIN checkout = that root itself when its `.git` is a directory, else the `gitdir: <main>/.git/
    worktrees/<name>` target named by the worktree's `.git` FILE, parsed here rather than by shelling out to
    git — a PreToolUse hook runs on every `dotnet` call and must not pay a subprocess (`main_repo_root`).
  • a FOREIGN agent's tree = `<main>/.claude/worktrees/agent-<agentId>` WHEN THAT DIRECTORY EXISTS, else the
    main checkout. This is true BY CONSTRUCTION: `Agent(isolation="worktree")` creates exactly that path and
    starts the agent in it, so the directory's existence IS the launch mode (`agent_working_tree`).
Consequences, all three intended: a worktree agent may build its OWN worktree while main-tree fleets are live; a
MAIN-tree build is still denied while any main-tree agent is live (the original purpose, unchanged); and a
main-tree build is ALLOWED while only worktree agents are live, because their binaries are not the main tree's.

⚠ AND THE FALLBACK IS TOWARD THE OLD RULE, NEVER TOWARD ALLOWING. If the caller's tree cannot be located, or the
worktree's `.git` file cannot be read or parsed, the agent→tree map cannot be built at all — so the decision
reverts to the SESSION-WIDE rule and every foreign live agent denies. Fail-open (below) covers a BROKEN guard;
this covers an UNKNOWN tree, where allowing would be the one outcome that reproduces 2026-08-04.

Detection is by TRANSCRIPT MTIME, which is the one signal that cannot be faked by a stale process: a live agent
writes to its own `agent-*.jsonl` continuously, so a file touched within the window means an agent is thinking
right now. Keyed on this session's id, so another project's fleet never blocks this one.

⚠ THE CALLER IS NEVER A FLEET. The question the guard asks is "is any transcript OTHER THAN MINE live?", and the
caller's own transcript is always fresh at PreToolUse — it is being written by this very tool call. Getting that
exclusion wrong makes the guard fail CLOSED, which it has now done three separate ways — PB103's TWO modes (an
agent inside its own worktree, then a main-tree agent counting its own transcript) and PB185 (every subagent,
because `transcript_path` names the SESSION transcript). ⚠ Cite PB103, not PB101: PB101 is the COLLATION
subsystem note, and it appears in this history only because its agent was the one who HIT the worktree mode
(`kb/Work/PB103.md` records the find that way). The exclusion is therefore keyed on the caller's IDENTITY, not on
a path string: see `caller_identity` / `foreign_transcripts`.

FAIL-OPEN BY CONSTRUCTION. Any error, any missing path, any unreadable directory ⇒ exit 0 and allow the build. A
guard that blocks the build because IT broke would be worse than the defect it prevents.

Both branches are provable without a fleet: `python scripts/hooks/fleet_active_build.py --self-test` drives the
pure decision functions through DENY and ALLOW alike, over REAL temporary worktrees so the `.git`-file parse and
the `.claude/worktrees/agent-<id>` existence check are exercised rather than mocked
(feedback_prove_the_watchdog_fails — a monitor is a gate; fire its failure branch once before trusting its
silence).

    does for the main session. A subagent's own file is `<session-id>/subagents/**/agent-<agent_id>.jsonl`, a
    different path entirely, so the raw string equality added for PB103 could never match and EVERY subagent
    denied its own build permanently (the caller rewrites its transcript on every tool call, so the 120 s window
