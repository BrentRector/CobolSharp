"""The R49 tooling readiness check, run by session_start.py at EVERY session start (and runnable by hand).

Owner, 2026-09-25: "It should not require manual intervention to use these. If my explicit permission for something is
required, automatic use of such a feature should trigger a query to me, not silently failure to use it."

So each adopted capability is CHECKED here, never assumed, and every line is one of:
  OK        present and in use
  REPAIRED  was missing and needs no permission, so this check fixed it (e.g. started the telemetry sink)
  ASK-OWNER needs the owner's permission or an owner-only action — the session MUST ask (AskUserQuestion), not skip it
  N/A       does not apply in this environment (e.g. a cloud session has no local telemetry sink)

    python scripts/hooks/tooling_check.py      # prints the block
