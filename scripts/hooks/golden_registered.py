"""PostToolUse hook — a conformance golden that is not in its manifest is flagged immediately.

A positive golden must be listed in its edition directory's manifest.json ("enabled" or "pending"); a negative
golden must be listed in tests/conformance/negative/manifest.json. An unregistered golden never runs AND fails the
manifest-integrity test — but only at the COMPREHENSIVE gate, never at the per-commit wave-local run. That delay is
why it has bitten twice in one session.

Read-only. Silent when the golden is registered or the file is unrelated.
