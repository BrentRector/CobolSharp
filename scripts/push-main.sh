# push-main.sh — ⛔ THE ONLY WAY A COMMIT REACHES `main`. (Owner decision 2026-09-06, question 23; kb/Work/PB796.)
#
# `main` carries a REQUIRED status check — `ci-gate`, the terminal job of .github/workflows/build-and-test.yml —
# with `enforce_admins: true`. Every push to this repository is made with the owner's credentials, so an
# administrator exemption would be worth nothing; the rule binds the orchestrator's own pushes exactly as it binds
# a lander's. A bare `git push origin HEAD:main` of an unverified commit is therefore REFUSED BY THE SERVER, and
# this script is the flow that earns the verdict first:
#
#     1. push HEAD to the landing branch `ci/<short-sha>`   (a check run is attached to the COMMIT, not a branch,
#     2. find the run for that exact sha                     so the verdict earned there is the one the protection
#     3. `gh run watch <id> --exit-status`                   reads when the same sha reaches main)
#     4. GREEN  -> `git push origin <the VERIFIED sha>:main` (fast-forward only), then delete the ci/ branch
#        RED    -> print the failing jobs and exit non-zero, WITHOUT touching main
#
# ⚙ WHY IT EXISTS. PB796: `git push origin HEAD:main` was the LAST step of both lander briefs, so nothing in the
# loop ever read the verdict the push triggered, and `main` stayed red for 29 hours across 16 consecutive
# completed runs while eleven landings each reported a green LOCAL gate. The local battery runs on ONE host
# (Windows, Debug); the workflow's `ubuntu-latest` jobs and its Release build are gated by CI and by nothing else.
# The brief-level fix ("wait for the run, report its conclusion") was prose in four places. This is the mechanism.
#
# ⭐ IT IS IDEMPOTENT AND SAFE TO RE-RUN. A full-matrix run is ~25–30 min, which is longer than an agent's command
# timeout — so a caller that is cut off simply RUNS IT AGAIN: a sha that already carries a green `ci-gate` skips
# straight to the main push, and a run already in flight for that sha is re-attached to, never duplicated. Run it
# in the background (the Bash tool's `run_in_background`) or re-run it; do not hand-roll the wait.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/push-main.sh [--branch-prefix ci] [--no-delete] [--audit]
#         --audit  — land nothing: report stale landing branches and exit 1 if any survives whose tip is
#                    already an ancestor of origin/main (the drift check kb/Work/PB950 asks for).
#         PUSH_MAIN_TIMEOUT_MIN=45  — how long to wait for the landing run (default 45)
# Exit:   0 = the commit is on main and its CI was green · 1 = CI red or the push refused · 2 = usage/state error

# ── Landing-branch hygiene (kb/Work/PB950) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ⛔ TWO MECHANISMS LEFT NINE BRANCHES BEHIND, AND THE OBVIOUS ONE WAS NOT THE COMMON ONE.
#   A. $BRANCH is computed from HEAD AT INVOCATION. A caller that rebases between attempts lands sha2, deletes
#      only ci/<sha2>, and orphans ci/<sha1> FOREVER — no later invocation ever computes that name again.
#      Measured 2026-09-21: battery #82 pushed ci/410280c17f6e, rebased onto a main registrar #8 had moved,
#      landed e3902c8f3, and left the first branch behind. SIX of the nine survivors were this shape.
#   B. the delete was `git push … --delete "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null && say deleted`, so a FAILED delete printed
#      nothing, set no exit code anyone read, and the landing printed its success marker anyway. Two were this.
# The fix is a LEDGER for A and a SWEEP for B — plus an unsilenced delete, without which B cannot be diagnosed
# at all. The sweep is what makes the NEXT orphan disappear automatically instead of accumulating.
