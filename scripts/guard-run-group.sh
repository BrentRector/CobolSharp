# Run ONE NIST group serially in an isolated scratch directory, emitting one "TEST: VERDICT" line per test to
# stdout. Used by scripts/guard-fast.sh to parallelize the NIST suite across cores with airtight isolation.
#
#   $1 = repo root (absolute)
#   $2 = group id (informational)
#   $3 = ordered, space-separated test names that must share a dir + run order (a producer/consumer chain, or a
#        single self-contained test)
#
# Mirrors scripts/guard.sh's per-test run+compare logic EXACTLY (same outfile/print-file/stdout resolution, same
# FAIL*/footer rules) so a verdict here is identical to the serial guard's — only the working directory differs.
# ⭐ THAT IS NO LONGER A PROMISE KEPT BY HAND: both guards call scripts/guard-verdict.sh, the ONE implementation
# of the evidence rules (`feedback_one_rule_one_place`). The prose used to say the two blocks were kept
# "character-for-character in step", and they had already drifted (this file's normalize() carried a `[ -f ]`
# guard guard.sh's did not) while sharing every hole kb/Work/PB473 found.
# The dir starts clean (mktemp) and is NOT cleaned between tests within the group, so a chain's shared TF### data
# files accumulate in declaration order exactly as they do in the serial guard's shared dir.
#
# ⛔ THE EVIDENCE RULES (plan §11 A12b/A12d; DESIGN-test-build-ci.md §3.10) live in scripts/guard-verdict.sh and
# cover all THREE arms — compile, run and compare. Read that file's header for what each one requires and why.
