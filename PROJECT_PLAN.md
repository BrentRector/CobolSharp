### Key Technical Decisions

Each decision below documents what was considered, the tradeoffs, and why we landed
where we did. These are living decisions — if evidence emerges that we chose wrong,
we update the decision and log the pivot in DEVLOG.md.

---

#### KTD-1: Target Platform — .NET (CIL)

**Alternatives considered:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **LLVM IR** | Best-in-class native codegen and optimization; huge community; targets every CPU architecture | No built-in decimal type — we'd need to build or wrap libdecnumber; no GC (must manage memory or link Boehm); massive dependency; LLVM C++ API is complex to call from C# |
| **JVM bytecode** | Mature ecosystem; `BigDecimal` for decimal math; GC included; cross-platform | No unsigned types; no value types (everything boxed); COBOL-to-Java interop less interesting commercially than COBOL-to-C#; JNI is painful |
| **Native x86-64 / ARM** | Maximum performance; no runtime dependency | Enormous effort (register allocation, ABI, calling conventions); must build our own runtime and decimal library; no GC; platform-specific |
| **.NET (CIL)** ✅ | 128-bit base-10 `decimal` type; GC; value types and structs; strong interop with C#/F#/VB.NET; cross-platform (.NET 8+); PDB debugging; Mono.Cecil for clean IL emission | JIT startup cost (mitigated by AOT); ecosystem smaller than JVM globally; some CIL opcodes are tricky (e.g., tail calls) |

**Decision**: .NET (CIL)

**Rationale**: The killer feature is `decimal`. COBOL's entire numeric system is base-10 with
fixed-point precision — rounding errors from binary floating-point are spec violations, not just
bugs. .NET's `decimal` is 128-bit base-10, which maps almost perfectly. On LLVM or native targets,
we'd spend months building a decimal arithmetic library and probably still get edge cases wrong.

The interop story is also compelling. The primary audience for a new COBOL compiler is
modernization — organizations wanting to call COBOL business logic from C# services. .NET makes
this seamless: the compiled COBOL assembly is just another .dll.

Precedent: Micro Focus Visual COBOL and Fujitsu NetCOBOL both target .NET in production,
validating that CIL can handle COBOL's requirements.

#### KTD-2: Implementation Language — C#

**Alternatives considered:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **C#** ✅ | Same ecosystem as target platform; can reference Roslyn's architecture; excellent tooling (debugger, profiler, analyzers); strong type system; async support for future compiler-server scenarios | Not as fast as C/C++ for raw parsing throughput |
| **F#** | Pattern matching is excellent for AST transforms; immutability by default suits compiler IR work; still .NET ecosystem | Smaller community; fewer developers can contribute; IDE support weaker than C#; mixing F# and C# in one solution adds friction |
| **Rust** | Memory safety; excellent performance; strong pattern matching; `enum` types ideal for ASTs | Cross-compilation to call .NET for code emission is awkward; interop with Mono.Cecil requires FFI or separate process; much smaller .NET ecosystem knowledge |
| **C/C++** | Maximum performance; traditional compiler implementation language | Memory safety issues; no .NET ecosystem benefit; would need to shell out to or embed Cecil; dramatically slower development velocity |

**Decision**: C#

**Rationale**: We're building a .NET compiler that emits .NET assemblies — staying in .NET for
the compiler itself means one ecosystem, one build system, one debug experience. Roslyn (the C#
compiler) is written in C# and serves as an excellent architectural reference. F# was a serious
contender — its discriminated unions and pattern matching are genuinely better for AST work — but
the trade-off in community size and contributor accessibility tipped the scale. We can always
use F#-inspired patterns (visitor pattern, expression trees) in C#.

Performance note: modern C# with spans, stack allocation, and the JIT's optimization is more than
fast enough for a compiler. Roslyn itself proves this at scale. If we hit parsing bottlenecks,
we can profile and optimize hot paths without switching languages.

#### KTD-3: Parser Strategy — Hand-Written Recursive Descent

**Alternatives considered:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **ANTLR** | Grammar-driven; generates parser from spec; widely understood; good error recovery | COBOL grammar is heavily context-sensitive (PICTURE clauses, Area A/B, COPY/REPLACE preprocessing); ANTLR's LL(*) struggles with COBOL's ambiguities; debugging generated code is painful; grammar maintenance becomes its own project |
| **PEG (e.g., peg-sharp)** | Unambiguous by construction; ordered choice handles some COBOL quirks | No left recursion (complicates arithmetic expressions); poor error messages by default; limited ecosystem in .NET |
| **yacc/bison style (LALR)** | Efficient table-driven parsing; well-understood theory | Shift-reduce conflicts abound with COBOL; almost impossible to express COBOL's context-sensitivity in BNF; no .NET-native tools |
| **Hand-written recursive descent** ✅ | Full control over context-sensitive parsing; can handle PICTURE strings, Area A/B, and other COBOL quirks inline; excellent error messages with full context; easy to debug step-by-step; proven by Roslyn, GCC (recent), Clang | More code to write; no grammar file as single source of truth; risk of divergence between parser and spec; requires discipline |

**Decision**: Hand-written recursive descent

**Rationale**: COBOL breaks parser generators in several specific ways:

1. **PICTURE clauses**: `PIC 9(5)V99` contains characters (`V`, `9`, `(`, `)`) that are
   identifiers and operators elsewhere. The lexer must context-switch when it knows a PICTURE
   clause is coming — this requires parser-to-lexer feedback that grammar tools don't support well.

2. **Fixed-form reference format**: Columns 1-6 are sequence numbers, column 7 is an indicator,
   columns 8-11 are Area A (divisions, sections, paragraphs must start here), columns 12-72
   are Area B. This column-position-dependent parsing is a lexer concern that affects grammar
   rules.

3. **COPY/REPLACE**: Text-level macro substitution happens before parsing, but the substitution
   rules themselves use parsing concepts (pseudo-text delimiters). This chicken-and-egg problem
   is hard to express in a grammar.

4. **Inline PERFORM scope**: `PERFORM paragraph-a THRU paragraph-b` creates a dynamic scope
   based on paragraph ordering in source — the parser needs to understand the procedure division's
   structure to resolve this.

5. **Implicit scope terminators**: Before END-IF was added, IF statements were terminated by
   periods. The parser must track period-terminated vs. explicitly-terminated scopes
   simultaneously.

Roslyn uses hand-written recursive descent for C# for analogous (though less severe) reasons.
The trade-off is more code, but we get perfect control and much better error messages.

We'll mitigate the "no grammar file" risk by keeping the parser methods named after spec sections
(e.g., `ParseIdentificationDivision()` maps to §11) so the spec itself serves as the grammar
reference.

---

#### KTD-4: CIL Emission — Mono.Cecil

**Alternatives considered:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **System.Reflection.Emit** | Built into .NET; no external dependency; well-documented | Cannot write assemblies to disk in .NET Core (only in-memory); no PDB support in modern .NET; API is stateful and error-prone; `ILGenerator` doesn't validate IL correctness |
| **Mono.Cecil** ✅ | Clean, object-model-based API; read AND write assemblies; full PDB support (portable PDB); widely used (Unity, Fody, PostSharp); actively maintained; validates structure | External NuGet dependency; learning curve for its object model |
| **IKVM.Reflection** | Used by IKVM (Java-to-.NET); supports assembly writing | Less documented; smaller community; primarily designed for IKVM's specific needs |
| **Emit CIL text → ilasm** | Simple text emission; easy to debug IL output | Requires ilasm as external tool; slow (fork process per compilation); limited PDB support; brittle string templating |
| **Roslyn SyntaxTree (emit C#)** | Transpile COBOL to C# source, let Roslyn compile | Semantics mismatch (COBOL GO TO, PERFORM THRU, ALTER have no C# equivalent without ugly hacks); generated C# would be unreadable; two-stage compilation is slow; debugging maps to generated C# not COBOL source |

**Decision**: Mono.Cecil

**Rationale**: Mono.Cecil hits the sweet spot. Its API models a .NET assembly as an object graph
(AssemblyDefinition → ModuleDefinition → TypeDefinition → MethodDefinition → ILProcessor) which
is natural to build up programmatically. Unlike Reflection.Emit, it can write to disk, supports
portable PDB for source-level debugging, and validates structural correctness.

The "transpile to C#" approach was tempting for its simplicity but was rejected because COBOL's
control flow (GO TO, ALTER, PERFORM THRU paragraph ranges) has no clean C# mapping. We'd end up
generating spaghetti C# with labels and gotos that Roslyn might even reject in some cases. Going
straight to CIL lets us emit the exact control flow COBOL requires.

#### KTD-5: Numeric Representation — Dual-Layer (byte[] Storage + decimal Computation)

**Alternatives considered:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **.NET `decimal` everywhere** | Simple; base-10; 28-29 significant digits; built-in arithmetic operators | Doesn't model COBOL storage layout (programs inspect/redefine memory at byte level); `decimal` is 16 bytes, COBOL COMP-3 PIC 9(3) is 2 bytes; can't do group MOVEs or REDEFINES over decimals; 28 digits may be insufficient for some COBOL programs (spec allows 18+ digit fields) |
| **`byte[]` everywhere, manual arithmetic** | Perfect storage fidelity; handles REDEFINES, group MOVEs, EBCDIC | Must implement decimal add/subtract/multiply/divide/exponentiation from scratch; slow; bug-prone; reinventing the wheel |
| **`byte[]` storage + `decimal` computation** ✅ | Storage fidelity for byte-level operations; leverages .NET decimal for arithmetic; clean separation of concerns | Marshal/unmarshal cost on every arithmetic operation; must carefully handle scaling (PICTURE V position) during conversion |
| **`BigInteger` + manual scaling** | Arbitrary precision; exact | No built-in decimal point handling; must track scale manually; slower than `decimal` for common cases |

**Decision**: Dual-layer — `byte[]` for storage, .NET `decimal` for computation

**Rationale**: COBOL programs routinely do things that break a "just use decimal" approach:

- `REDEFINES`: Two data items share the same memory. A numeric field might be redefined as an
  alphanumeric field, or vice versa. This requires actual byte-level storage.
- Group `MOVE`: Moving a group item copies raw bytes, regardless of subordinate item types.
- `INSPECT` / `STRING` / `UNSTRING` operate on the byte representation.
- `USAGE COMP-3` (packed decimal) stores two digits per byte with a sign nibble — programs may
  inspect this layout directly.

But for *arithmetic*, .NET's `decimal` is excellent — base-10, 28-29 digits, correct rounding.
So the architecture is: store data in `byte[]` matching COBOL's memory model, marshal to
`decimal` when arithmetic is needed, marshal back after computation.

The marshal/unmarshal cost is real but bounded — it only happens on arithmetic operations, not on
MOVEs or byte-level operations. Profiling will tell us if this becomes a bottleneck; if so, we
can cache the `decimal` representation alongside the `byte[]` and invalidate on byte-level writes.

---

#### KTD-6: String Representation — byte[] with Codepage Awareness

**Alternatives considered:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **.NET `string` (UTF-16)** | Native .NET type; easy to use; full Unicode | COBOL strings are fixed-length, space-padded, and often single-byte (EBCDIC or ASCII); .NET strings are immutable (COBOL strings are mutable in-place); UTF-16 doubles memory for ASCII data; can't do byte-level REDEFINES over strings |
| **`char[]`** | Mutable; indexable | Still UTF-16; same memory doubling; doesn't model COBOL byte-level semantics |
| **`byte[]` with codepage** ✅ | Exact model of COBOL memory; supports EBCDIC and ASCII; fixed-length; mutable in-place; works with REDEFINES and group MOVEs | Must convert to/from .NET strings for I/O and interop; must implement comparison, INSPECT, STRING/UNSTRING operations on byte arrays |
| **`Span<byte>` views into shared buffer** | Cache-friendly; models COBOL's contiguous memory; zero-copy slicing | Span can't be stored on heap (ref struct); complicates data item lifetime; adds complexity early |

**Decision**: `byte[]` with codepage metadata

**Rationale**: COBOL's string model is fundamentally different from .NET's. A COBOL PIC X(10)
field is exactly 10 bytes, always, space-padded on the right. It's mutable in-place. It
participates in group MOVEs (raw byte copy) and REDEFINES (memory aliasing). None of this maps
to .NET `string`.

We store alphanumeric data as `byte[]` with a codepage tag (initially ASCII/UTF-8, with EBCDIC
support added later). Conversion to .NET `string` happens only at the I/O boundary (DISPLAY,
ACCEPT, file operations, .NET interop).

Future optimization: in Phase 6, we may explore a shared `byte[]` buffer per program (modeling
COBOL's contiguous WORKING-STORAGE) with `Span<byte>` or `Memory<byte>` views for each data
item. This would give us cache-friendly layout and zero-copy group MOVEs. But that's premature
optimization for now.

#### KTD-7: File I/O Backend — Abstract Interface with Pluggable Implementations

**Alternatives considered:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Direct .NET FileStream** | Simple; no dependencies; works for sequential files | No indexed (ISAM) file support; no record-level locking; COBOL's fixed-length record semantics need a wrapper anyway |
| **SQLite as backing store** | Full SQL engine; ACID transactions; indexed access via SQL queries; single-file database | Impedance mismatch (COBOL files are record-oriented, not relational); overhead of SQL parsing for every READ/WRITE; complex dependency |
| **LiteDB** | Document/key-value store; .NET native; single-file; supports indexing | NoSQL model doesn't perfectly map to COBOL's key-sequential access patterns; less mature than SQLite |
| **Custom B+ tree implementation** | Perfect control; can match COBOL ISAM semantics exactly | Enormous implementation effort; bug-prone; essentially building a database engine |
| **Abstract `IFileHandler` interface** ✅ | Pluggable backends; start simple, add complexity incrementally; testable (mock files in tests) | Abstraction layer adds indirection; must design interface carefully to avoid leaking backend assumptions |

**Decision**: Abstract `IFileHandler` interface

**Rationale**: COBOL has three file organizations (sequential, indexed, relative) with three
access modes each (sequential, random, dynamic). Rather than commit to one backend now, we
define an interface and implement backends incrementally:

- **Phase 4 start**: `SequentialFileHandler` using .NET `FileStream` — simplest, covers the
  most common case.
- **Phase 4 mid**: `IndexedFileHandler` — likely backed by a B+ tree library or LiteDB. The
  key requirement is key-sequential access (START, READ NEXT) which rules out pure hash maps.
- **Phase 4 late**: `RelativeFileHandler` — random access by record number, implementable with
  fixed-length record files and seek arithmetic.

This lets us defer the hardest decision (indexed file backend) until Phase 4, when we'll have a
better understanding of the actual access patterns and performance requirements.

---

#### KTD-8: Test Framework — xUnit + NIST COBOL85 Suite

**Alternatives considered:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **xUnit** ✅ | Most popular .NET test framework; parallel execution; clean assertion syntax; excellent IDE integration; theory/inline-data for parameterized tests | None significant |
| **NUnit** | Also popular; slightly different assertion model; constraint-based assertions are expressive | Slightly less community momentum than xUnit; constraint model can be verbose |
| **MSTest** | Built into Visual Studio; Microsoft-supported | Fewer features; less community tooling; no built-in parameterized test support comparable to xUnit theories |

**For conformance testing:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **NIST COBOL85 test suite** ✅ | Industry standard; ~400 test programs; covers core language features; every COBOL compiler is measured against it; freely available | Written for COBOL-85, not COBOL 2023 (missing OO, intrinsic functions, some modern features); test infrastructure is dated (expects specific report format); some tests assume mainframe behavior |
| **Custom test suite only** | Tailored to our implementation; can cover COBOL 2023 features | No external validation; risk of testing our interpretation of the spec rather than the spec itself; massive effort to achieve coverage |
| **Both** ✅ | NIST for baseline conformance; custom for COBOL 2023 features and regression | More test infrastructure to maintain |

**Decision**: xUnit for unit/integration tests + NIST COBOL85 suite for conformance + custom
tests for COBOL 2023 features

**Rationale**: xUnit is the de facto standard in modern .NET. The NIST suite is non-negotiable —
it's how the industry measures COBOL compiler correctness, and any compiler claiming production
quality must pass it. We'll supplement with custom tests for ISO 2023 features (OO COBOL,
intrinsic functions, exception handling) that the 1985-era NIST suite doesn't cover.

---

#### KTD-9: Build System — dotnet CLI / MSBuild

**Decision**: Standard .NET toolchain (dotnet CLI, MSBuild, NuGet)

**Rationale**: No reason to deviate. `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`, `dotnet pack` cover our
needs. MSBuild is extensible if we need custom build steps (e.g., preprocessing the NIST test
suite). NuGet handles our dependency on Mono.Cecil and distribution of the runtime library.

---

#### KTD-10: CI — GitHub Actions

**Decision**: GitHub Actions with build + test on every push

**Rationale**: The repo is on GitHub. Actions is free for public repos, integrates natively,
and supports .NET workflows out of the box. We'll add a matrix build (Windows + Linux + macOS)
once we have meaningful cross-platform surface area (Phase 4+, when file I/O matters).

Fixed by conveying the key as a PIC-aware integer through the same `PicRuntime.DecodeNumeric`/`EncodeNumeric` (via `EmitLocationArgsWithPic`) the subscript/MOVE paths use: `EmitSetRelativeKey`→DecodeNumeric→`FileRuntime.SetRelativeKey(name,int)` (before random/dynamic WRITE/REWRITE/DELETE **and keyed READ**); `EmitStoreRelativeKey`→`GetRelativeSlot`→EncodeNumeric (§14.9.30 GR25 round-trip); `RelativeFileHandler.ReadByKey` uses the pending key. **Baselined two TF021 chains** by ordering members consecutively in the guard (it runs in list order without cleaning data files): RL101A→RL102A→RL103A (252) and RL201A→RL202A→RL203A (DYNAMIC, 253). 253 needed no code change — pure coverage from 252.

CCVS contains a ~0.7% errata rate of `INVALID` written without the required `KEY` (10 vs 1,490 in `newcob.val`) that 1980s/90s compilers tolerated. Pattern (à la GnuCOBOL `-std`): grammar parses the permissive superset (`INVALID KEY?` in all five phrases); a centralized `DialectStrictnessChecks.CheckInvalidKeyNoiseWord` reports `CBL3611` (error) under named-strict modes, accepts under `Default`. `--nist` now implies `--standard default` (permissive) unless overridden — so `--standard cobol2023` correctly **rejects** the CCVS form while NIST runs accept it. COMPILE_FAIL dropped 12→5; **RL105A** (creates+verifies 3 relative files) and **RL108A** (TF061 bundle) baselined (self-contained, deterministic); RL207A skipped (depends on still-failing RL206A).

The RL update/verify chains failed for three independent reasons, peeled apart by tracing each FAIL* to its layer: (1) **`XXXXX###` data-file ASSIGN never shared across run units** — the NIST preprocessor mapped `XXXXP/XXXXD###`→shared `"TF###"` but not the permanent `XXXXX###`, so a creator (RL108A `XXXXX061`) and its consumers got different program-id-qualified files; fixed with an **organization-aware** map (`XXXXX###`→`"TF###"` only inside RELATIVE/INDEXED SELECTs, preserving DEVLOG-244 isolation for SEQUENTIAL absent-file tests like SQ130A — a blanket first cut regressed SQ130A, caught by the guard). (2) **Leniency L2** (`RELATIVE data-name` without KEY) wasn't binding the key: `relativeKeyClause` required KEY and `organizationClause` greedily ate the bare RELATIVE; made KEY optional + ordered `relativeKeyClause` before `organizationClause`, so the key resolves and `IrSetRelativeKey` fires; dialect-gated (CBL3613/3614, plumbed `CompilationOptions` into `SemanticBuilder`). (3) **REWRITE's INVALID KEY / NOT INVALID KEY phrases were never lowered** (a general codegen bug — `LowerRewrite` emitted the rewrite + status and returned, so `NOT INVALID KEY GO TO` never branched and control fell through); fixed to lower the phrases like `LowerDelete`.

RL206A creates a relative file with `RECORD IS VARYING … DEPENDING ON` and verifies the DEPENDING length round-trips; relative slots were fixed-width with no per-record length (22 FAIL* "WRONG LENGTH RECORD"). Taught the relative subsystem variable records: `RelativeFileHandler` gains `IsRecordVarying`, `WriteVariable` stores the actual length (not padded), each read sets `_lastRecordLength`, and persistence uses a length-prefixed slot format (`[4-byte len][max data]`, gap=0xFFFFFFFF) so the length survives close/reopen and cross-run-unit. Lowerer `IsVaryingRecord` extends the variable-write/length-store/read-into-largest paths to RELATIVE; Binder emits `FileRuntime.SetRelativeVarying`. **Bug found + logged:** the new `SetRelativeVarying` runtime call had no CilEmitter case → fell through to the `// NOP` tail with its args still on the stack → `InvalidProgramException` at Main (masked for several iterations by a stale rl206a.txt); fixed by adding the emission case.

They were the long-standing format-3 gap (300/500 FAIL*, COMPUTED empty). The WRITE was already correct (256); the fault was the **READ buffer size** — `ResolveReadRecordLocation` read the largest 01 *without* `receiving: true`, so an 01 with an OCCURS-DEPENDING table got a buffer sized by the (just-`MOVE SPACES`'d-to-zero) depending item, truncating the table bytes.

Entry 258's hypothesis (a PERFORM…THRU internal-GO-TO return defect) was **wrong**; instrumenting the *main* dispatch loop pinned the real bug. Every `pc` value (fall-through `myIndex+1`, GO TO, PERFORM THRU bounds, GO TO DEPENDING) is in **declarative-inclusive** paragraph-index space, but the main dispatch switch indexed `ParagraphDispatchOrder` which **excluded** declaratives — so any program with leading DECLARATIVES dispatched to the wrong paragraph (off by the declarative count; trace showed a `+3` step with 2 declaratives) and looped forever, never reaching STOP RUN. Fix: include declaratives in `ParagraphDispatchOrder` (list position == ParIdx) + start the loop at a new `IrModule.EntryParagraphIndex` (first non-declarative paragraph, ISO §14.4); declaratives stay in the switch but are reached only via the USE handler's `IrPerform`/`IrPerformThru` (direct calls), never the main loop. Declarative-free programs are byte-identical (`EntryParagraphIndex=0`). **SQ105A 22/22** (was a hang) baselined; **SQ213A** un-vacuumed (its prior baseline was a vacuous `000 OF 000` false-pass — the off-by-N sent it straight to termination) → genuine **7/7** incl.

Made dispatch order build from `ParagraphSymbolMethods` and GO TO/DEPENDING resolve via new `TryResolveParagraphIndex(ParagraphSymbol)` (symbol-first, name fallback); the bound GO TO already carries the section-qualified target symbol. **(2) Inverted/non-contiguous PERFORM…THRU:** the old physical-range model exited the moment pc left `[start,end]` (wrong for GO TO-out-and-back and for inverted ranges where proc-2 precedes proc-1; the lowerer even *swapped* inverted ranges into a `[min,max]` block — NC102A "RETURN MECHANISM LOST"). Replaced with one shared `Dispatch(startPc, exitPc)` helper per program (`EmitDispatchHelper`): switches over the FULL paragraph table, follows control flow anywhere, returns only when the exit paragraph falls through to `exitPc+1` (return-address model, ISO §14.9.30).

Per ISO §9.1.2/§12.4.5.2 `ORGANIZATION SEQUENTIAL` (and the default) is **record sequential** — fixed contiguous records, no delimiters — which alone supports fixed-length in-place REWRITE.

SQ201M 12 auto-checks (LINAGE-COUNTER after OPEN/PAGE/sequences + 4 EOP-phrase combos) PASS, 0 FAIL*; SQ209M 0 FAIL*. Both baselined. Guard ALL GREEN: 1000 unit, 347 integration, **221 NIST** (94 NC + 42 IF + 12 SM + 4 IC + 48 SQ + 19 RL + 2 IX), 0 regressions (WRITE-path changes gated on LinageBody>0 / EOP phrases). | LINAGE pt.2: data-name LINAGE phrases (SQ208M/SQ210M — values read at OPEN OUTPUT §13.18.34 GR6b; currently hang). Then SQ206A SAME AREA / SQ303M MULTIPLE FILE TAPE; ST sort/merge; IX indexed runtime. |
| 2026-06-02 | **LINAGE subsystem pt.2 (data-name phrases) → SQ208M/SQ210M: +2 → 223 NIST.** DEVLOG 264. Completes LINAGE with data-name LINAGE/FOOTING/TOP/BOTTOM phrases (§13.18.34 GR6b: runtime values read at OPEN OUTPUT). Semantic captures each phrase's data-name (FileSymbol.Linage*Name/HasLinageDataNames); LowerOpen emits new `IrInitLinage` on OPEN OUTPUT (per-phrase: data-name location or integer-literal const); EmitInitLinage decodes each location→int (or pushes const) → `FileRuntime.InitLinage` (applies the 4 params + resets counter to 1, GR7d). SQ208M (all data-names) + SQ210M (mixed) run to completion 0 FAIL* (both visual-INSPECTION; counter mechanics auto-verified by SQ201M). Both baselined. Guard ALL GREEN: 1000 unit, 347 integration, **223 NIST** (94 NC + 42 IF + 12 SM + 4 IC + 50 SQ + 19 RL + 2 IX), 0 regressions. LINAGE subsystem COMPLETE (register + int/data-name params + counter advance/reset/overflow + footing/overflow EOP + AT/NOT-AT END-OF-PAGE). | SQ206A `SAME AREA` (no RECORD) + SQ303M obsolete `MULTIPLE FILE TAPE` I-O-CONTROL clauses; ST sort/merge; IX indexed runtime. |
| 2026-06-02 | **I-O-CONTROL: SAME (AREA/FOR optional) + MULTIPLE FILE TAPE + OPEN REVERSED → SQ206A: +1 → 224 NIST.** DEVLOG 265. Three storage/tape parse forms (no semantic effect on disk). SAME clause: AREA & FOR are optional words per §12.4.6.4 (Format 1 underlines only SAME), so `SAME file-1 file-2` is conformant — reworked to `SAME (RECORD|SORT|SORT-MERGE)? AREA? FOR? fileName (COMMA? fileName)*`; I-O-CONTROL paragraph now allows multiple clauses before one period (`(ioControlClause DOT?)*`). Obsolete `MULTIPLE FILE TAPE … CONTAINS` parsed+ignored (new MULTIPLE/TAPE/POSITION tokens). Obsolete `OPEN … REVERSED` / `WITH NO REWIND` per-file tape phrase: new `openFileSpec` (new REVERSED token), BindOpen/ReferenceResolver read the file + ignore the phrase. **SQ206A 4/4, 0 FAIL*** (SAME AREA + SAME RECORD AREA, auto-verified) baselined. SQ303M now compiles but is a flagging module (OPEN REVERSED only, no CCVS report → excluded like IF401M). Guard ALL GREEN: 1000 unit, 347 integration, **224 NIST** (94 NC + 42 IF + 12 SM + 4 IC + 51 SQ + 19 RL + 2 IX), 0 regressions (OPEN-grammar change touches every file test, all unchanged). | SQ401M (flagging, further non-conforming clauses); SQ NO_OUTPUT runtime tail; ST sort/merge; IX indexed runtime; guard-criterion gap (footer FAILED). |
| 2026-06-02 | **Variable-length REWRITE (DEPENDING length → GR16 44) + REWRITE USE declarative → SQ227A/SQ228A: +2 → 226 NIST.** DEVLOG 266. SQ227A: `RECORD VARYING … DEPENDING ON`, REWRITE a different-length record must give status 44 (§14.9.35 GR16); the REWRITE was passing the record-name's declared size, not the DEPENDING value, so GR16 saw equal lengths → 00. Added `IrRewriteRecordFromStorage.LengthLocation`; LowerRewrite passes the DEPENDING item for record-SEQUENTIAL varying files (RELATIVE excluded — GR18 allows differing length; a first cut regressed RL207A, guard-caught), EmitRewriteRecordFromStorage reads it at runtime. Added `EmitUseDeclarative` to REWRITE (§14.9.49) so a REWRITE exception fires the USE declarative (SQ228A). SQ227A 16/16, SQ228A 1/1 baselined. Guard ALL GREEN: 1000 unit, 347 integration, **226 NIST** (94 NC + 42 IF + 12 SM + 4 IC + 53 SQ + 19 RL + 2 IX), 0 regressions. | SQ FAIL* tail: REWRITE/READ-after-AT-END (SQ133A→43, SQ136A→46, SQ144A decl); OPEN-absent/OPTIONAL (SQ141A/142A/203A). Then ST sort/merge; IX runtime. |
| 2026-06-02 | **Sequential read-position state: READ-after-at-end '46' + REWRITE-no-read '43' → SQ133A/136A/144A: +3 → 229 NIST.** DEVLOG 267. SequentialFileHandler didn't track the file position across ops. Added `_lastReadUnsuccessful` → a READ after an unsuccessful READ returns 46 (§14.9.30 GR21; SQ136A); `_prevOpWasSuccessfulRead` → a sequential REWRITE not immediately after a successful READ returns 43 (§14.9.35 GR5; SQ133A). Both reset at OPEN. SQ144A's declarative-not-executed resolves for free (REWRITE now returns exception 43, which the REWRITE USE declarative from 266 fires on). SQ133A 15/15, SQ136A 1/1, SQ144A 1/1 baselined. Guard ALL GREEN: 1000 unit, 347 integration, **229 NIST** (94 NC + 42 IF + 12 SM + 4 IC + 56 SQ + 19 RL + 2 IX), 0 regressions (touches every sequential READ/REWRITE). | OPEN-absent/OPTIONAL cluster (SQ141A absent→declarative, SQ142A absent→35, SQ203A OPTIONAL READ); then ST sort/merge; IX runtime. |
| 2026-06-02 | **OPEN-absent / SELECT OPTIONAL cluster → SQ141A/142A/203A: +3 → 232 NIST (SQ FAIL* tail clear).** DEVLOG 268. Two defects in opening an *absent* sequential file for INPUT. **(1) Per-program isolation:** the NIST preprocessor special-cased `XXXXX001/002` to a *shared* literal (`"TFIL1"/"TFIL2"`) **before** the org-aware mapping (DEVLOG 255) that keeps SEQUENTIAL targets program-id-qualified (DEVLOG 244) — so SQ142A's never-written `SQ-FS1` resolved to a `tfil1.txt` a prior test had created, and OPEN INPUT returned `00` not `35`. Removed the blanket replacement so both flow through the org-aware path (RELATIVE/INDEXED → shared `"TF###"`; SEQUENTIAL → implementor-name → Binder qualifies `{program}-{file}`). Broad blast radius, 0 regressions. **(2) OPEN INPUT optional-absent must succeed + position at EOF (ISO §9.1.13.2):** `SequentialFileHandler` returned `05` but opened no stream → `IsOpen` false → first READ hit the not-open guard `47` instead of AT END `10`. Added `_optionalAbsentInput` (set on optional-absent OPEN INPUT, keeps `IsOpen` true, routes every READ to AT END `10`; reset at OPEN/CLOSE). Fixes both the `READ … AT END` phrasing (SQ203A GF-02) and the no-phrase + `USE … EXCEPTION ON INPUT` declarative phrasing (GF-03: READ now stores `10` → FILE STATUS first digit `"1"` → declarative sets EOF-FLAG; was `47`→`"4"`, exactly the failing `COMPUTED=4`). SQ141A 1/1, SQ142A 1/1, SQ203A 4/4 baselined. Guard ALL GREEN: 1000 unit, 347 integration, **232 NIST** (94 NC + 42 IF + 12 SM + 4 IC + 59 SQ + 19 RL + 2 IX), 0 regressions. SQ suite FAIL* tail clear (remaining: flagging modules SQ303M/SQ401M + hangs SQ105A/114A). | IX indexed-file runtime (the dominant `RECORD … KEY` leniency + indexed I/O correctness); then ST sort/merge. Guard-criterion sweep (footer "TEST(S) FAILED") still pending. |

## Code Quality

See AUDIT_REPORT.md sections 3.1-3.6 for the comprehensive code quality audit.
Sweep 3.1-3.5 completed (2026-03-23): wrapper elimination, dedup, method splits,
stale docs, dead code. Section 3.6 (ReportWriter) deferred until Report Writer is implemented.

## Design Decisions (Resolved)

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | EBCDIC codepages? | ASCII-only. EBCDIC is a future consideration. |
| 2 | Indexed files? | Custom IndexedFileHandler with in-memory Dictionary + secondary indices. |
| 3 | OO COBOL? | Deferred. Parsing only, no binding or emission. |
| 4 | Assembly emission? | Disk always (Mono.Cecil). In-memory for integration tests via temp dir. |
| 5 | .NET version? | .NET 9.0 only. |
| 6 | Runtime linking? | Runtime DLL copied alongside compiled assembly. |
| 7 | DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA? | Implemented: grammar flag propagated through compilation pipeline. |

## Open Design Questions

| # | Question | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Collating sequence (ALPHABET) — how to apply to runtime comparisons? | OPEN |
| 2 | OCCURS DEPENDING ON — runtime truncation enforcement strategy? | OPEN |
| 3 | Inter-program metadata — compile-time CALL parameter validation? | OPEN |

## How to Resume Work

Any future session should:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` — it contains the session resume context and known gaps
2. Read `PROMPT.md` — architectural doctrine and non-negotiable rules
3. Check this file's **Progress Log** for the latest entry and its "Next Step"
4. Read `DEVLOG.md` recent entries for context on last session's decisions
5. Run `bash scripts/guard.sh` to verify baseline before making changes
