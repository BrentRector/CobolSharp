/// <summary>
/// THE single post-bind edition-conformance pass (rearch PHASE-03 Step 14;
/// <c>docs/rearchitecture/DESIGN-version-conformance-pipeline.md</c> §2.4). It runs over the bound run unit AFTER
/// bind and BEFORE emit and is the sole owner of edition gating, routing every version-gated construct through the
/// ONE <see cref="ConstructRegistry.Check"/> funnel so the binder is edition-AGNOSTIC (zero <c>Check</c> calls of
/// its own).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// TWO-ARM by design (§1/§2.4 of the pipeline design):
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Parse-tree arm</b> (<see cref="ParseArm"/>) — walks the raw <c>CompilationUnitContext</c> and fires
/// every SYNTACTIC introduction/removal/phrase gate + the §8.9 reserved-word funnel on the construct's
/// RECOGNITION (it absorbs the former <c>EditionValidator</c>). Recognition-based because an introduction gate
/// must name its edition even when the below-edition construct ALSO has a semantic error: the bound node it would
/// have produced is dropped (<c>BoundUnsupported</c>/<c>BoundNop</c>) on that path, but its PARSE node is always
/// present (the load-bearing finding, DEVLOG 724 — a bound-arm intro gate silently dropped the 0900).</item>
/// <item><b>Bound-tree arm</b> (<see cref="GateStatement"/>/<see cref="GateMove"/>) — the END-STATE home of only
/// the genuinely-SEMANTIC gates whose identity is a RESOLVED bound fact, never mere presence: MOVE
/// figurative-category (source × each receiver's picture), and the gates conditioned on file-organization /
/// access-mode / USAGE / pointer-category (SET object-reference, SET pointer UP/DOWN, INVOKE, READ PREVIOUS,
/// START FIRST/LAST, START WITH LENGTH, READ ADVANCING ON LOCK). A naive parse-arm would over- or under-fire
/// these. No bound node carries a raw parse context — the <c>BoundTree.cs</c> invariant stands.</item>
/// </list>
/// The two arms are disjoint: a <c>Check</c> for any one construct fires from EXACTLY one arm, the losing site
/// deleted as its twin lands. <b>Migration state:</b> Step 14h (DONE) moved every SYNTACTIC statement/expression/
/// literal gate + the §8.9 funnel to the parse-arm (14h.1 foundation → 14h.4b), so the binder holds ZERO
/// statement-level edition Checks. Step 14g is relocating the DATA/PICTURE/OO gates: <b>14g.1 (DONE)</b> moved the 8
/// PicInfo USAGE / PICTURE-category gates to the bound-arm <see cref="GateData"/> enumerator over
/// <c>DataBinder.ConformanceForest()</c>; <b>14g.2 (DONE)</b> moved all four data-description-clause gates
/// (BASED/TYPE/PROPERTY/TYPEDEF) to the parse-arm on RECOGNITION — none needs a resolved fact, and a bound-arm home
/// drops the 0900 on a declaration-error path (the review correction, DEVLOG 734: even init-only <c>IsTypedef</c>
/// fails, because the typedef ITEM is discarded from the forest when RegisterTypeDecl rejects it or it binds into
/// method scope). <b>14g.3–14g.5 (DONE)</b> completed the DATA/PIC/OO migration: OO class/interface + OCCURS DYNAMIC
/// (14g.3, parse-arm); file SHARING/LOCK-MODE + SPECIAL-NAMES FOR + PD RETURNING/RAISING (14g.4, parse-arm — the recon's

/// national-edited PICTURE skeletons (14g.5, bound-arm via <c>PicInfo.SkeletonGate</c> — the recovered category erases
