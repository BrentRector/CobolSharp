/// THE ONE PLACE A DECLINED ANNEX-A.4 OPTIONAL ELEMENT IS REFUSED BY NAME (COBOLNET1708 / COBOLNET1709) — a
/// sibling to <see cref="VersionConformancePass"/> and <see cref="FlagConformancePass"/>, run right after them
/// from <c>BinderDriver</c>.
///
/// <para>WHY A SEPARATE PASS AND NOT AN ARM OF THE VERSION PASS. Edition gating answers "does this construct
/// exist in the edition you targeted"; this answers "does this implementation claim support for this optional
/// module". They are orthogonal — an A.4 decline fires at EVERY edition the element exists in, never depends on
/// <c>--std</c> beyond that, and its severity comes from the strict/permissive seam rather than from
/// <see cref="Editions.ConstructAvailability"/>. Folding it into <c>VersionConformancePass</c> would give that
/// pass two answers to two different questions, which is the shape
/// <c>docs/rearchitecture/DESIGN-version-conformance-pipeline.md</c> exists to prevent (its ParseArm reports
/// through <c>ConstructRegistry.Check</c> and nothing else).</para>
///
/// <para>WHY A PARSE-TREE WALK AND NOT A BINDER HOOK. A declined clause has no bound node — that is what
/// declining it means — so there is no binder arm to hang it on, and the binder's own entry paths would drop it
/// silently in exactly the places it matters most: <c>DataBinder.BindEntry</c> returns early for levels 66 and
/// 88, and <c>BindCondition</c> returns early for an UNNAMED level-88, which is precisely the §13.16.2 Format-4
/// validation entry (<c>88 [condition-name-2] value-clause .</c>). A walk over the parse tree sees the written
/// syntax whether or not anything binds it.</para>
///
/// <para>⛔ ADDING A DECLINED CONSTRUCT: add its rule to <c>Grammar/Core/CobolDeclined.g4</c> and, if it is an
/// ENTRY POINT there (a rule no other rule in that file references), a <c>VisitXxx</c> override here.
/// <c>DeclinedFacilityDriftTests</c> derives that obligation FROM the grammar file, so a new entry-point rule
/// with no override fails the build rather than parsing into silence — the failure mode a hand-maintained list
/// would have re-created. Alternatives added UNDER <c>validationClause</c> need no code at all: the message
/// names the clause from its own leading keywords.</para>
///
/// <para>UNDER <c>--permissive</c> these downgrade to warnings through the ONE declined-element seam
/// (<c>EditionContext.Declined</c>, whose <c>DiagnosticDescriptor.PermissiveInert</c> fact says so) —
/// the same seam every
/// removed construct uses, and the program compiles with the declined element simply ABSENT: a level-88 whose
/// only content was the format-5 VALID phrase keeps its ordinary format-3 reading, an unnamed format-4 entry
/// contributes nothing, and an <c>APPLY COMMIT</c> clause is ignored — which is the truthful outcome, because
/// there is no transaction manager for it to configure. That is the migration mode's documented bargain, not a
/// silent wrong answer: the warning names the facility at every site.</para>
