/// identifier-1</c> (§14.9.49.3 SR9) — and before this funnel BOTH were written as
/// <c>foreach (report) if (report.Groups.FirstOrDefault(name-matches) is {} g) return g;</c>: a loop shape that
/// encodes <i>find one</i> where §8.4.2.2 requires <i>find exactly one</i>. With the same 01-level group name in
/// two report description entries, the reference bound to whichever RD was written first, silently — so a
/// GENERATE of the second report's group ran the OTHER report's declarative and nothing downstream noticed
/// (feedback_two_arm_dispatch: two arms, and neither one was right).

/// uniqueness shall be established through qualification for each user-defined name explicitly referenced,
/// except as specified in rules 2 through 6" — none of exceptions 2–6 covers a report-group name. §8.4.2.2.3
/// SR1 restates it as the syntax rule: "For each non unique user-defined name that is explicitly referenced,
/// uniqueness shall be established through a sequence of qualifiers that precludes any ambiguity of reference."
/// The available qualifier is the report-name (§8.4.2.2.2 Format 1's file-report-qualifier; §14.9.16.3 SR1 says
/// so in words: "It may be qualified by a report-name"), which is why the qualified spelling exists at all.
