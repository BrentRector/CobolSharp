/// TWO things — the OCCURS KEY phrase of identifier-1 <b>in its own order</b>, and the WHEN phrase decomposed into
/// its Format-2 operands — and because neither existed as a model, all seven were unenforced together. The model
/// is built once here and each rule is a predicate over it, so the next Format-2 rule is a predicate rather than
/// another tree walk.

///   significance) resolved through <see cref="OdoModel.KeyItems"/>.</item>

/// §14.9.37.4 GR9 leaves the search TECHNIQUE to the implementor ("A non serial type of search operation may take

/// parse-wide / bind-narrow doctrine (stated in <c>CobolExpressions.g4</c> in those words). Screening here is what
/// lets the diagnostic quote the rule; an ANTLR rule tightened to the printed format could only report an
/// unexpected token. A WHEN whose shape is not Format 2 at all is reported through the EXISTING
/// <see cref="StatementValidation.RejectStatementOperand"/> (COBOLNET1757 — "an operand a statement's own syntax
/// rules or general format do not admit"), never a fourth code; a PARENTHESIZED condition is unwrapped silently,
