/// ⛔ <b>THE PICTURE-PLACEMENT INVARIANT — both directions of it, in ONE pass over the finished forest.</b>
///
/// <para><b>ISO §13.16.3 SR8</b>, its last sentence: "For any other entry describing an elementary item, a
/// PICTURE clause shall be specified except as indicated in Syntax rule 9." — <i>elementary ⇒ has a
/// PICTURE</i>, the CLOSING GUARD that guarantees no elementary item ever reaches code generation without a
/// <see cref="DataItem.Pic"/>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>ISO §13.18.40.3 SR1</b>, its whole text: "The PICTURE clause may be specified only at the
/// elementary level." — <i>has a PICTURE ⇒ elementary</i>, the converse, added by kb/Work PB527. The two are
/// one rule about one thing (WHERE a PICTURE clause may stand) and they need the same fact to be decidable —
/// whether the entry has subordinates — which is why they live in one pass and share
/// <see cref="HasNoSubordinates"/>. Neither can be asked at entry bind: the subordinate entries are not parsed
/// when <c>BindEntry</c> runs, and <c>PictureAnalyzer.Analyze</c> has no view of the tree at all.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists (kb/Work PB487).</b> The rule was enforced only for the two usages that had a
/// dedicated <see cref="PicPending"/> mark, NATIONAL and BIT. Every other picture-less elementary entry escaped
/// with <c>Pic == null</c> and CRASHED the compiler — an unhandled <c>System.NullReferenceException</c> in
/// <c>MoveEmitter.ConvertSource</c>, or a raw Roslyn <c>CS0103</c> the user cannot act on. Measured on plain
/// COBOL with no exotic clause in it at all:
/// <code>
///   01 M.
///   01 N PIC X(4).
///   …  MOVE "ABCD" TO M
/// </code>
/// M is elementary (nothing is subordinate to it) and has no PICTURE, so it is SR8-nonconforming; the compiler
/// answered with a stack trace and no diagnostic. It is the same hole the PB487 catch-all reached through
/// <c>01 M MESSAGE-TAG.</c>, but it is reachable WITHOUT the catch-all, which is why closing the §13.16.2 clause
/// list does not close it.
///
/// <para><b>Where the picture-less usages are handled instead.</b> §13.16.3 SR8's own first sentence exempts
/// binary-char/short/long/double, float-short/long/extended, index, message-tag, object reference, pointer,
/// function-pointer and program-pointer — for those <c>BindEntry</c> SYNTHESIZES a <see cref="PicInfo"/>, and
/// SR9's VALUE-implied PICTURE arrives with one too, synthesized by <c>SynthesizeImpliedPictures</c> two passes
/// earlier (kb/Work PB504/PB831; <c>DataBinder.ImpliedPicture.cs</c>). So the test here is simply "elementary and
/// still no Pic after every synthesis and inheritance pass has run", which is exactly the population SR8 governs
/// and needs no second copy of the exemption list — and no carve-out of any kind — to maintain.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Two forests, deliberately.</b> The DIAGNOSTIC is reported over <see cref="ConformanceForest"/> so a
/// TYPEDEF template is named once rather than once per <c>TYPE</c> reference site — the entry the programmer
/// must change. The RECOVERY shape is then applied over <see cref="CompositionForest"/>, because
/// <c>ExpandTypes</c> has already cloned the broken template and a clone would otherwise carry the null into
/// codegen with its own diagnostic suppressed. Same rule, one message, no escape.</para>
