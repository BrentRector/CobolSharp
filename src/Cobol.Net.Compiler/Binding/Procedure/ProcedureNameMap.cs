/// <para><b>Why the type exists.</b> Every procedure-name scope here used a bare
/// <c>Dictionary&lt;string, T&gt;.TryAdd</c>, whose contract is "keep the first, DISCARD the rest silently". A
/// map built that way cannot fail to diagnose ambiguity — it cannot even <i>represent</i> it: by the time
/// anything could ask "is this spelling unique?", the multiplicity is gone. ISO §8.4.2.2.1 makes that question
/// the whole of reference resolution — "uniqueness shall be established through qualification for each
/// user-defined name explicitly referenced", excused by rule 1 ("No other name has the identical spelling") or,
/// for a paragraph, rule 6 ("the section containing the reference also contains the named paragraph") — and
/// §8.4.2.2.3 SR1 repeats it as a syntax rule. So the declaration side owes the resolution side the COUNT, and
/// it is one type's job to keep it rather than five call sites' habit.</para>
/// <para><b>Shape.</b> The first declaration lives in <see cref="_first"/> — the hot map, one probe, exactly the
/// dictionary that was there before. A repeated spelling additionally lands in <see cref="_duplicated"/>, which
/// is EMPTY for every well-formed source unit, so <see cref="IsDuplicated"/> costs one <c>Count</c> test on the
/// ordinary path and <see cref="Definitions"/> allocates nothing until a program actually collides. The
/// duplicate list carries the first definition too, so a diagnostic can name every candidate in declaration
/// order without re-walking the pc space.</para>
/// <para>Ordinal-case-insensitive by construction: a COBOL word's spelling is case-insensitive (§8.1.2), and the
/// comparer is fixed HERE rather than passed in, so no scope can be built with a different one.</para>
