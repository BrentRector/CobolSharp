/// ⛔ THE ONE PARTITION OF A PROCEDURE-DIVISION-HEADER RAISING PHRASE (ISO §14.2.1 / §14.2.2 SR7–SR9;
/// kb/Work PB815 + PB814). Every source element whose header can carry the phrase — program, function, program
/// and function prototypes (<c>EcBinder.EcCollectPdRaising</c>), method definitions and method prototypes
/// (<c>DataBinder.OoBindMethodSignature</c>) — calls THIS, and gets back the tuples
/// (<see cref="RaisingTarget"/>) the consuming rules compare against.
/// <para><b>What it replaced.</b> Two verbatim copies — the PD-header arm and the METHOD-ID arm — each
/// partitioning a bare word list into "EC name" and "class name", each carrying the same comment that SR9's
/// interface alternative was "a later refinement", and neither able to see FACTORY because the grammar had
/// dropped it (<c>raisingClause : RAISING cobolWord+</c>). A fix to one would have left the other refusing the
/// same source (feedback_two_arm_dispatch); the extraction is the fix.</para>
/// <para><b>Why the partition is a bind-time question.</b> The three alternatives are each one user-defined
/// word; only the EC catalog (§14.6.13.1) and the REPOSITORY scope of THIS source element (§8.4.6.4 — through
/// <see cref="OoNameResolution.Lookup"/>, the one class/interface funnel) can tell them apart. The grammar keeps
/// the one axis it can see — the FACTORY phrase — on <c>raisingTarget</c>.</para>
