// COBOL-85 (both verbs' phrases were complete by 1985); no edition gate applies. The post-85 deltas
// (class national / boolean operands, zero-length-item rules, dynamic-length SIZE — §14.9.43.4 GR1)
// concern data shapes the current data model cannot describe, and the EC-OVERFLOW-STRING /
// EC-OVERFLOW-UNSTRING names (2002+, GR8b / GR16b) await the EC model; the ON/NOT ON OVERFLOW control
// flow itself is edition-invariant.
