//  The COBOL.NET bound semantic tree (COBOLNET_DESIGN §2). The binder resolves every reference to a Place, every
//  literal to typed text, and every condition/expression to a bound node ONCE — so the backend (and future
//  desugar passes + the G4 PC dispatcher) walk this tree WITHOUT re-touching the ANTLR parse tree. No bound node
//  holds a raw parse context. Control-flow *emission* (sequential paragraph calls now, the dispatcher at G4) is the
//  backend's concern; this tree faithfully represents the program's paragraph/statement structure.
