/// <summary>
/// THE §13.18.60.3 USAGE DECLARATION-PLACEMENT screen (kb/Work PB183) — the syntax rules of the USAGE clause
/// that restrict WHERE a usage phrase may be written, as opposed to what a PICTURE may accompany it (SR3 / SR5 /
/// SR12 / SR13 / SR20, enforced per entry in <c>PictureAnalyzer</c>) or what may REFERENCE the resulting item
/// (SR10, enforced in <c>ExpressionBinder</c>). Partial-class extension over <c>DataBinder</c>, run as the
/// declared <c>CheckUsageDeclarations</c> pass (see <c>BindPipeline</c>).
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists as its own pass.</b> Three rules of one clause, all with the same subject — a
/// WRITTEN data description entry — and not one of them was written down anywhere in the compiler. Measured on
/// 2acbd842, every one of these compiled and ran:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item><c>01 G. 05 P USAGE POINTER.</c> — a pointer member of an ORDINARY group, SR14's headline case.</item>
///   <item><c>01 G USAGE POINTER. 05 A PIC X. 05 B PIC X.</c> — the same violation acquired through
///     §13.18.60.4 GR1, which applies a group's usage "only to each elementary item in the group".</item>
///   <item><c>01 W IS TYPEDEF. 05 WP USAGE POINTER.</c> — a WEAK typedef template; SR14 permits the subordinate
///     form only under a type declaration that includes the STRONG phrase.</item>
///   <item><c>01 P USAGE POINTER. 01 G. 05 Q SAME AS P.</c> — the same level-05 pointer manufactured by a
///     fourth acquisition route.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para><b>⛔ The rule was verified against the PRINTED page before the screen was written.</b> SR14's reading
/// is restrictive enough to be exactly the shape the falsely-restrictive-OCR hazard produces, so PDF page 535
/// (printed folio 505) was rendered at 300dpi and read as an image: the printed SR14 is character-for-character
/// the transcription at <c>specs/ISO_COBOL.md</c>. There is no OCR loss here and the rule really is this
/// restrictive.</para>
///
/// <para><b>⛔ SR14 OMITS INDEX; the neighbouring SR4 INCLUDES it.</b> Six usages there, five here — deliberate
/// drafting, not an oversight. <c>05 IX USAGE INDEX.</c> inside an ordinary group is LEGAL COBOL and stays legal;
/// <see cref="Sr14PlacementClass"/> and <see cref="Sr4ConstantRecordUsage"/> are therefore two predicates and
/// must never be "unified". A positive golden (<c>pb183_usage_index_in_group_ok</c>) and a unit drift test are
/// what keep that true, because over-rejection — not under-rejection — is this screen's real hazard.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Level 77 satisfies SR14's first arm — a determination, derived, not assumed.</b> The rule says "at
/// level 1" and the standard elsewhere writes "level 1 or level 77" (§8.5.1.6.3 alignment) and "a level 01 entry
/// or a level 77 entry" (§14.9.4.3 SR1) when it means both, which is a real argument the other way. It loses to
/// two texts. §8.5.1.3.2: "Three types of entries exist for which there is no true concept of level", the second
/// being "entries that specify noncontiguous working-storage, local storage, and linkage data items" — so a 77
/// entry is not AT some level greater than 1; it is outside the level system, and SR14's arm cannot exclude it
/// by level arithmetic. And §13.11.1 declares the two spellings ALTERNATIVES for one thing: "Data elements that
/// bear no hierarchical relationship to any other data item may be described as records that are single
/// elementary items. Alternatively, such data elements ... may be described as separate data description entries
/// having level-number 77." SR14's evident subject is SUBORDINATION to a non-strong group; a 77 entry is defined
/// by having no such relationship. The surveyed implementations agree — GnuCOBOL's testsuite uses
/// <c>77 ptr USAGE POINTER.</c> throughout. The test is <see cref="Sr14PermittedLevel"/>, ONE named predicate,
/// so the determination is a one-line change if the owner reads the letter the other way.</para>
///
/// <para><b>A syntax rule is a "shall", so the conforming response is a compile-time diagnostic</b> — the same
/// posture as SR14's drafting twin §13.18.57.3 SR6 (COBOLNET1532, a plain <c>Edition.Error</c> with no
/// permissive escape). It is NOT dialect-gated: <c>--permissive</c> is the migration mode for constructs an
/// edition REMOVED, which this is not. GnuCOBOL accepts the shape, but the follow-GnuCOBOL rule covers
/// implementor-defined LATITUDE, and a syntax rule is not latitude.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Edition axis.</b> The MESSAGE-TAG phrase is a 2023 addition (VCR row 32) and has no <c>Usage</c>
/// member yet, so SR14's message-tag arm and SR21 (MESSAGE-TAG exclusivity) are forward obligations the drift
/// test holds open rather than dead code. For POINTER / OBJECT REFERENCE / PROGRAM-POINTER / FUNCTION-POINTER
/// Annex E carries no note on §13.18.60.3 — but Annex E's scope is 2014→2023 only, so its silence is a MISSING
