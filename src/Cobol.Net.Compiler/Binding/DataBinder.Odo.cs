            //    the initial capacity of the associated dynamic-capacity table is calculated according to the

            //    clause") as reaching a Format 1 `VALUE IS literal-1`, which trivially has no TO phrase. IT DOES
            //    NOT. GR16 sits under the **FORMAT 2** general-rule heading (GR11–GR16), and §13.18.63 states
            //    cross-band application EXPLICITLY and in ONE direction only — GR11 "General rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
            //    6, 7, 8, and 10 above apply", GR17, GR21, GR24 all import FORMAT 1 rules INTO another band, and
            //    nothing imports GR12–GR16 into FORMAT 1. The syntax rules settle it independently: §13.18.63.3
            //    SR22 ("A VALUE clause without the TO phrase shall not be specified in the same entry as an OCCURS
            //    clause with a DYNAMIC phrase but no TO phrase, or in any entry subordinate to such an OCCURS
            //    clause") is the rule that keeps GR16b from having no operand, and IT TOO is in the FORMAT 2 band
            //    (SR16–SR23) with no FORMAT 1 counterpart. Were GR16 to reach Format 1, `05 A PIC X OCCURS DYNAMIC
            //    FROM 2 VALUE "Z".` would hit GR16b with no expected capacity to set — a hole the standard would
            //    have had to close and did not, because there is no hole.
            //
            //    So a Format 1 VALUE here is CONFORMING SOURCE with a fully determined meaning, and refusing it
            //    was rejecting legal COBOL (§13.18.38.3 has no rule forbidding VALUE on a Format 4 entry):

            //        assumed for it." The item-6 EXCEPTION is the carve-out that lets a GR16-derived (Format 2)
            //        capacity survive this step, and it changes NOTHING for a Format 1 VALUE either way: §8.5.1.9.1
            //        gives the same number from the other side — "The current capacity of a dynamic-capacity table
            //        may be initialized explicitly in the FROM phrase of the OCCURS clause or implicitly in the
            //        VALUE clause. If neither is specified, the current capacity is initialized to zero" — and
            //        GR16 is the only "implicitly in the VALUE clause" mechanism there is. FROM (or zero) both ways.

            //    initializer, which for a Format 1 VALUE is DataItem.ValueAt → RawValue. The refusal's two arms
            //    disagreed with each other, too, which is what gave the defect away: the GROUP arm fired only when
