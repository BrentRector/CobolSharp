/// PERFORM, and the same value for every other construct that names one (a SORT/MERGE INPUT/OUTPUT PROCEDURE,
/// §14.9.40.4 GR10/GR11). It is a RETURN-ADDRESS pair, not a physical block: execution begins at
/// <see cref="Start"/> and the compiler-inserted return mechanism fires when pc <see cref="End"/> falls off its
/// own end (control-flow deep-dive D5). Every consumer that must know whether the set is empty asks
/// <see cref="IsEmpty"/>; nothing decodes the pair arithmetically.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>⛔ <b>EMPTINESS CANNOT BE DERIVED FROM THE PAIR, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS TYPE EXISTS</b>
/// (kb/Work PB440). A section with ZERO paragraphs is legal COBOL (§14.4.2 — "a section header followed by zero,
/// one, or more successive paragraphs"), and it resolves to <c>(s, s−1)</c>. An INVERTED THRU range —
/// procedure-name-2 physically PRECEDING procedure-name-1, reached by a GO TO, which §14.9.28.4 GR6 explicitly
/// permits ("There is no necessary relationship between procedure-name-1 and procedure-name-2") and NIST NC102A
/// PFM-TEST-F1-10 exercises — also resolves to <c>End &lt; Start</c>, and when the two procedures are ADJACENT it
/// resolves to the SAME pair <c>(s, s−1)</c>. One must execute nothing; the other must execute from <c>s</c>
/// until control reaches <c>s−1</c>. So <c>End &lt; Start</c> is ambiguous, every hand-written
/// <c>start &gt; end</c> / <c>Start &lt;= End</c> test was answering the wrong question, and the bit is CARRIED.</para>
/// <para>The canonical empty range is still <c>(s, s−1)</c> rather than a sentinel, because that pair is exactly
/// what makes GR4's THRU composition come out right: an empty procedure-name-1's <see cref="Start"/> is the pc at
/// which execution continues past it, and an empty procedure-name-2's <see cref="End"/> is the last pc before it,
/// so <c>PERFORM empty-sec THRU p</c> and <c>PERFORM p THRU empty-sec</c> compose with no special case
