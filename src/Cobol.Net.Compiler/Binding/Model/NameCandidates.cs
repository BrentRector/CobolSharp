/// <summary>⛔ THE ISO §8.4.2.2 CANDIDATE SET OF A QUALIFIABLE NAME REFERENCE — AND IT HAS NO INDEXER (kb/Work PB978;
/// generalized over the name class by kb/Work PB919). §8.4.2.2.1 makes the number of survivors the whole answer
/// ("uniqueness shall be established through qualification for each user-defined name explicitly referenced";
/// §8.4.2.2.3 SR1 — "uniqueness shall be established through a sequence of qualifiers that precludes any ambiguity
/// of reference"): one survivor resolves, and zero or several is a resolution failure. Every DATA DIVISION resolver
/// that returned a <c>List&lt;DataItem&gt;</c> invited its caller to read <c>[0]</c>, and three did — the report
/// binder's CONTROL / SOURCE / SUM lookup, the OCCURS DEPENDING ON fallback and the file-control key and ASSIGN
/// USING operands — so an ambiguous reference compiled clean and ran on whichever item was declared first. This type
/// is the fix the way <see cref="ReferenceResolver.ProbeResult"/> was PB221's: the set can be COUNTED and NARROWED,
/// and its one member read only when there is exactly one (<see cref="Single"/>). The first-declared member is
/// reachable only through <see cref="DataBinder.UniqueOrReportAmbiguous{T}"/>, the ONE ambiguity verdict, which
/// grants it solely under <c>--permissive</c> (the procedure division's disposition, kb/Work R33).
/// <para>⛔ ONE TYPE FOR EVERY NAME CLASS SR1 COVERS, NOT ONE PER CLASS. SR1 is written about "each non unique
/// user-defined name", so the data-name (<see cref="DataItem"/>) and index-name (<see cref="IndexDeclaration"/>)
/// sets are the same type over different members and meet the same verdict — kb/Work PB919 measured the cost of
/// the alternative: index-names had no candidate set at all, and two tables' <c>INDEXED BY IX</c> silently shared
/// one cell.</para></summary>
