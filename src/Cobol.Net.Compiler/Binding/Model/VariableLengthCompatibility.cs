/// undergo a comparison or a move operation, in either direction, explicitly or otherwise, unless the other
/// operand is a compatible group. Groups are compatible if all variable-length data items correspond and match
/// as specified below." Three named consumers import it verbatim — §14.8.2.2 ("If either the formal parameter or
/// the argument is a variable length group, the formal parameter and the argument shall be compatible, as
/// described in 8.5.1.12"), §14.8.3.2 (the same sentence over a RETURNING pair), and §14.9.4.3 SR25, which makes
/// both apply to a Format-2 CALL. Format 1 needs none of this: SR12 forbids the crossing outright
/// ("Identifier-2 shall not reference a variable-length group"), which is why the relation belongs at the
/// Format-2 / INVOKE boundary and nowhere else.</para>

/// same relative byte positions within their groups".</item>
/// <item>§8.5.1.12.1 rule 2 + §8.5.1.12.3 sentence 2 — corresponding tables MATCH "when the byte length of
