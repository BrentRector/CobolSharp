/// ⭐ ISO §8.3.3.6.3 SR3 — <i>"If the length of literal-1 is greater than one, it is not permitted to be associated
/// with a numeric or numeric-edited item"</i> — in ONE place, for every ASSOCIATION a program can write (kb/Work
/// PB422). §8.3.3.6.4 GR2's NOTE 1 names the associations: "the figurative constant is moved to it, compared with it, or
/// paired with it in a binary operation". The askers are therefore the MOVE edition pass (the written MOVE, every
/// implicit FROM/INTO move, and INITIALIZE REPLACING's hypothetical MOVE — <c>VersionConformancePass.GateSr5</c>)
/// and the ONE relation checkpoint (<c>StatementValidation.CheckRelationalOperands</c>, which IF, EVALUATE
/// pairings and ranges, PERFORM UNTIL and SEARCH WHEN all pass through). The third association, a binary
/// operation, cannot reach a numeric item: the boolean-expression binder refuses every non-boolean operand first
/// (COBOLNET1511).
///
/// <para>⛔ THIS IS NOT §14.9.25.3 SR5. SR5's exception — "an ALL "literal" figurative constant (containing only
/// digits) … to an integer numeric item" — carries no length qualifier, so <c>ALL "57"</c> is inside what SR5
/// permits; what bars it is THIS rule, which is not a MOVE rule at all and reaches a comparison exactly as it
/// reaches a move. Until kb/Work PB422 the multi-character case rode SR5's 2023 removal row, which accepted it at
/// 85/2002/2014 and under a diagnostic naming the wrong rule at 2023, and no comparison was screened at any
/// edition.</para>
///
/// <para>⚠ DETERMINATION — THE EDITION EDGE (VCR Table 7 row 7.13; the repository holds no 1985/2002/2014 text,
/// ratified decision #1, so the edge is DERIVED and stated so it can be overturned in one line): the association
/// is an OBSOLETE element of ANSI X3.23-1985 and was deleted with the rest of that list by ISO/IEC 1989:2002 —
/// the posture of every other Table-7 row (DATA RECORDS, VALUE OF, ALTER …). The 2023 rule carries no edition
/// qualifier and Annex E (the 2014→2023 delta) does not list it, so 2014 and 2023 agree; CCVS-85 carries the
/// '74 tests of the shape (NC105A MOVE-TEST-176..178) only as "DELETED BY FCCTS" — consistent with the
/// designation, not a proof of it. Hence the registry row
/// <c>all-literal-multichar-numeric-removed-2002</c>: accepted at 85 with the §8.3.3.6.4 GR2 repeat-and-truncate
/// value, COBOLNET0902 at 2002 and later (a warning under <c>--permissive</c>, the value preserved). The rejected
/// reading — an error at EVERY edition, from the 2023 text alone — would reject a program the 1985 standard
/// admits.</para>
