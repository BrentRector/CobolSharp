/// <para>The receiver of a Format-15 float word is confined by §14.9.39.3 SR32 to a STANDARD floating-point
/// usage; of those, the two COBOL.NET provides map EXACTLY onto the CLR's IEEE types — FLOAT-BINARY-32 →
/// <c>float</c> = binary32, FLOAT-BINARY-64 → <c>double</c> = binary64 — so the interchange format GR33–GR35
/// name IS the carrier and nothing is approximated here. FLOAT-BINARY-128 and the two FLOAT-DECIMAL usages are
/// Annex A.3 items 17/19 documented non-support, refused at declaration (COBOLNET1564), so no receiver of those
/// usages reaches this code.</para>
/// <para>⛔ EVERY VALUE IS SPELLED AS A BIT PATTERN, never as a CLR constant or a negation. <c>double.NaN</c> is
/// 0xFFF8000000000000 — its sign bit is SET — so GR34's "otherwise the sign is positive" would have to be
/// written <c>-double.NaN</c> and would then depend on how a constant negation folds; and the CLR has no
/// signaling-NaN constant at all, because every managed arithmetic path quiets one.</para>

/// <c>BitConverter.Int32BitsToSingle(unchecked((int)0x7F800001))</c> on the premise that "a reinterpretation
/// performs no arithmetic, and so cannot quiet the value". The EXPRESSION cannot; the PIPELINE did, twice: the
/// JIT folds an inline reinterpretation of a constant into a floating constant, which it carries as a
/// <c>double</c> (the binary32 SNaN came out <c>0x7FC00001</c> in an optimized build), and the binary32 image
/// lane widened the value through <c>double</c> on its way to the item's bytes. The value now reaches the item
/// through <c>CobolFloat.FromBinary32Bits</c> (opaque to the JIT) and <c>CobolNum.FormatImageSingle</c> (no
/// binary64), and <c>IeeeSpecialsTests</c> asserts the STORED image, not the expression.</para></summary>
