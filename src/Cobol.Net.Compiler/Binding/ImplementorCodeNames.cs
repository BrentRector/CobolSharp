/// no keyword already reaches — SR15 asks only which NAMES are supported — and giving ASCII a 256-character
/// reading would be inventing a set ("extended ASCII") that no standard defines.</para>
/// <para><b>EBCDIC</b> — <b>IBM CCSID 37 (code page 037, "EBCDIC US/Canada")</b>, 256 characters, taken from
/// .NET's own <c>Encoding.GetEncoding(37)</c>: ordinal n is the native character that page maps code unit n−1 to,
/// the collating position of a native character IS its code unit in that page, and the correspondence with the

/// (<c>survey_compilers_on_latitude</c>): it is the canonical, registered, COMPLETE single-byte EBCDIC page —
/// a bijection of all 256 code units onto 256 distinct native characters, exactly the Latin-1 repertoire, which

/// whose users write <c>ALPHABET … IS EBCDIC</c> in the first place. GnuCOBOL's OWN default (its
/// <c>-febcdic-table=default</c>) is a historical restricted table that corresponds to no registered CCSID; its
/// named alternates are CCSID 500 variants. Following its latitude does not mean adopting a table that is both
/// GPL and unregistered — ⛔ none of its tables or sources are read, copied or derived from here
/// (<c>feedback_gnucobol_differential</c>). CCSID 500 differs from 37 in five punctuation positions and is the

/// <para><b>Characters outside the page.</b> The native alphanumeric character set is the 65 536 UTF-16 code
/// units (determination D-N1) and CCSID 37 spells only 256 of them, so 65 280 native characters have NO EBCDIC
/// ordinal and NO EBCDIC code unit. Two consequences, both already the standard's own answer rather than a new
/// rule: (1) as a COLLATING SEQUENCE they are the "<i>characters of the native collating sequence that are not
/// specified</i>" of §12.3.7.4 GR7 k3 — they "<i>assume a position … greater than that of the highest character
/// specified</i>", with "<i>the relative order within the set of these unspecified characters … unchanged from
/// the native collating sequence</i>" — which is precisely the tail every sparse <see cref="CollatingTable"/>
/// already computes, so GR7 i's obligation to give EVERY character a collating position is discharged by
/// adopting GR7 k3's own rule as this implementor's specification; (2) as a CODED CHARACTER SET they are simply
/// not members, so no SYMBOLIC CHARACTERS or CLASS ordinal reaches them and a CODE-SET record area holding one
/// cannot be represented on the medium (§13.18.13.4 GR6 b) — reported by the runtime, never silently mangled.
/// The page's own 256 native characters are exactly U+0000…U+00FF, so an alphanumeric record area — one byte per
