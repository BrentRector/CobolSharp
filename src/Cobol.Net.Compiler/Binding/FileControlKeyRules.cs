    // with SR8/SR9. The collating-sequence-clause is likewise screened at its own resolution site

    // edit — and returns null when none is written, which is also the "does this entry specify the format?"
    // answer. A separate boolean predicate beside the marker would be the same list twice, and the second copy is
    // the one that would not learn about the next Format-1 clause.
