/// <summary>
/// ⛔ <b>ISO §14.6.13.2's EXEMPTION TABLE, AS A STRUCTURE.</b> The clause states five sibling conditions over one
/// subject — the content of a sending operand that is not valid — and each carries its OWN list of contexts in
/// which the reference is exempt from raising. This value names the context ONCE at the reference site; every
/// rule then reads its own list off it.
///
/// <para><b>Why this is not a boolean.</b> It was one (<c>floatCheck</c> / <c>floatSendingExempt</c>), and a
/// boolean can carry exactly ONE rule's list — so it carried rule 3's, and rule 2 could not be implemented at all
/// without either inheriting the wrong exemptions or opening a second parallel flag that would drift from the
/// first (kb/Work PB230). The lists genuinely differ:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Rule 2</b> (a fixed-point numeric sending item that would evaluate false in a numeric class condition
/// → EC-DATA-INCOMPATIBLE) exempts <b>two</b> contexts: "a sending item is referenced in a class condition, or …
/// a sending item is processed in a VALIDATE statement".</item>
/// <item><b>Rule 3</b> (a standard-float sending operand that is ±Inf/NaN → EC-DATA-NOT-FINITE) exempts
/// <b>four</b>: those two, plus "a sending item is referenced in a sign condition" and "the sending and receiving
/// items in a MOVE statement are defined with the same standard floating-point usage specification".</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>So a SIGN condition and a same-usage MOVE are exempt for a float operand and <b>NOT</b> for a
/// fixed-point one — a distinction no single flag can express, and the exact distinction the standard draws
/// deliberately: §8.8.4.7.4 GR2 gives a float sign test a well-defined answer for NaN (it reads the IEEE sign
/// bit), and §14.9.25.4 GR6c makes a same-usage MOVE a verbatim transfer with no conversion. Fixed-point has
/// neither special rule, so neither exemption.</para>
/// <para>Rule 1 (a boolean sending item) shares rule 2's two-entry list; when it is wired it reads
/// <see cref="FixedPointChecked"/>'s sibling off this same value rather than growing a third flag.</para>
/// <para><b>And one rule that is not §14.6.13.2's at all.</b> §14.9.25.4 GR6 d) 1's closing sentence raises
/// EC-DATA-INCOMPATIBLE for an ALPHANUMERIC sending operand whose content is not numeric — a rule §14.6.13.2
/// cannot state, because such content is perfectly valid for the SENDER's own data description; it is the MOVE
/// into a numeric receiver that asks a numeric question of it. That makes it the one rule here whose list is an
/// opt-IN of a single context rather than an opt-OUT of several (<see cref="SendingRef.MoveToNumeric"/> /
/// <see cref="SendingRefRules.AlphanumericChecked"/>, kb/Work PB844) — which is why every other reading below is
/// written as an EXCLUSION list: a context added to this enum must default to CHECKED for the rules that raise
/// everywhere, not silently inherit an exemption it was never granted.</para>
