//  The emitter's mutable state model (P7 Step 9b; the phase doc's AS-BUILT PLAN). The cross-partial mutable
//  fields formerly scattered over the CSharpEmitter partials become three cohesive per-scope objects so the
//  Step-9 collaborator emitters receive their shared state EXPLICITLY (ctor-threaded), never through a god
//  class's private fields. All three are RUN-UNIT lifetime (fields of ProgramEmitter since Step 9n, like
//  NameAllocator); the "per unit" / "per statement" designations below document the MUTATION discipline —
//  which emitter writes the field, and when — preserved exactly from the pre-split partials (byte-exactness
//  gate: the 32 characterization snapshots).
