/// ⛔ THE ELEMENTARY CHARACTER RECEIVING STORE — the ONE place the MOVE rules' store of a character string into an
/// elementary alphanumeric or national receiving operand is decided, for every verb that transfers "according to
/// the rules for the MOVE statement" (kb/Work PB871).
/// <para>Two arms, and the second is why this class exists. A fixed-length receiver takes the string
/// left-justified, space-filled or truncated on the right to its width (a JUSTIFIED one right-justified —
/// §14.9.25.4 GR6c). A DYNAMIC-LENGTH receiver takes it WHOLE: §14.9.25.4 GR8 routes every MOVE into one through
/// §8.5.1.10.4 — "If a dynamic-length elementary item is a receiving operand and is not reference-modified, the
/// new value becomes the content of the item. The new length of the dynamic-length elementary item is determined
/// by the length of new content" and "If the maximum length is reached, the value is truncated on the right as
/// necessary." A dynamic-length item's PICTURE is ONE symbol (§13.18.19.3 SR1), so a store that fits the string to
/// the PICTURE's width writes exactly one character — which is what UNSTRING and ACCEPT did, because each carried
/// its own private copy of the fixed-length arm and only <see cref="MoveEmitter"/> knew the dynamic one.</para>
/// <para>A REFERENCE-MODIFIED dynamic-length item is §8.5.1.10.4's other case — "treated as a fixed-length data
/// item whose length is the dynamic-length elementary item's current length" — and never reaches here: every
/// caller routes a <c>RefModPlace</c> through <c>PlaceRenderer.Write</c>'s splice first.</para>
/// <para><c>ReceivingStoreDriftTests</c> fails if an emitter under <c>CodeGen/Verbs</c> builds either store
/// itself, so the next MOVE-rules verb inherits the dynamic arm instead of re-deriving the fixed one.</para>
