/// <summary>⛔ THE ONE TABLE FROM AN I-O STATUS VALUE TO THE CONDITION IT EXPRESSES, as the C# test the emitted
/// branch reads (kb/Work PB810). Every I-O verb's phrase dispatch — AT END, INVALID KEY, the NOT phrases, the
/// END-OF-PAGE success guard, ON EXCEPTION — and both generated after-verb hooks (<c>__IoCheck</c>,
/// <c>__IoCheckEc</c>) ask one of these three questions of a status, and they ask it HERE, so no site can answer
/// it from a paraphrase. <c>IoStatusClassDriftTests</c> forbids a first-character status comparison anywhere else
/// under <c>CodeGen</c>.
/// <para><b>The table is §9.1.13.1's own.</b> <i>"I-O status expresses one of the following conditions upon
/// completion of the input-output operation"</i> and §9.1.13.2 through §9.1.13.11 then give each condition its
/// class of values. Three of those classes drive a phrase:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Successful completion</b> — the <c>'0x'</c> class (§9.1.13.2, and §9.1.13.3's implementor-defined
///   <c>'0x'</c>): the NOT AT END / NOT INVALID KEY / NOT END-OF-PAGE / NOT ON EXCEPTION imperatives.</item>
/// <item><b>At end</b> — <i>"A sequential READ statement was unsuccessfully executed as a result of an at end
///   condition"</i> (§9.1.13.1), whose values are §9.1.13.4's '10' and '14': the AT END imperative
///   (§14.9.30.4 GR24 c)).</item>
/// <item><b>Invalid key</b> — §9.1.13.5's <c>'2x'</c> values: the INVALID KEY imperative (§9.1.14).</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>⛔ <b>EVERY OTHER UNSUCCESSFUL STATUS TAKES NO PHRASE, and that is a rule, not a default.</b> The
/// determination of kb/Work PB810: §14.9.30.4 GR21 sets '46' for a sequential READ whose previous READ or START
/// was unsuccessful and says execution <i>"proceeds as indicated in General rule 24"</i>, but GR24's actions are
/// conditioned on its own first words — <i>"If, during the execution of the READ statement, the at end condition
/// exists"</i> — and '46' is not the at end condition: §9.1.13.7 6) makes it a LOGIC ERROR, which §9.1.13.1
/// defines as <i>"unsuccessfully executed as a result of an improper sequence of input-output operations"</i>.
/// The rule that therefore governs is §14.9.30.4 GR13: <i>"If neither an at end nor an invalid key condition
/// occurs during the execution of a READ statement, the AT END phrase or the INVALID KEY phrase is ignored"</i>,
/// and GR13 b) sends control through §9.1.12's input-output exception processing — a USE declarative, then the
/// end of the READ. The surveyed implementations agree: GnuCOBOL's generated AT END test is the EC-I-O-AT-END
/// exception code, and IBM Enterprise COBOL documents the AT END phrase for the at end condition only.</para></summary>
