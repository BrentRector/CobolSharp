/// <summary>
/// THE §14.6.2.3.2 action-1 BACKGROUND — the one place that answers "what fills storage that has no VALUE
/// clause" (kb/Work PB152).
///
/// <para><b>The rule, in order.</b> §14.6.2.3.2 numbers the initial-state actions, and the first two settle both
/// scope and sequence: action 1 — "If the INITIALIZE clause is specified in the OPTIONS paragraph, the storage
/// allocated for the implied or associated sections is set to the specified-fill-character"; action 2 — "The
/// internal data described in the working-storage section and local-storage section is initialized as described
/// in 13.18.63, VALUE clause." So the fill is a BACKGROUND laid down FIRST and then OVERWRITTEN by VALUE
/// clauses — never a per-item substitute for a missing VALUE. Nothing here needs sequencing code: a field
/// initializer is one expression, and this changes only what the expression is when no VALUE was written.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why it exists as its own type.</b> "What fills a VALUE-less item" was composed in THREE places and
/// only one of them had ever been fixed. PB151 wired the ALLOCATE arm (§14.9.3.4 GR8/GR9) and left the other
/// two: <c>PicInfo.DefaultInitializer</c> (the native-field arm) and <c>GroupImageCodec</c>'s fall-through (the
/// Tier-B image arm) each hardcoded <c>' '</c> / <c>'0'</c> / <c>0L</c> and never consulted the OPTIONS model at
/// all. Worse, the landed arm's fill decoder was PRIVATE to <c>PtrEmitter</c>, so the two dead arms could not
/// have reused it even if someone had tried. Measured on 2acbd842: with
/// <c>OPTIONS. INITIALIZE ALL TO X"5A".</c> a VALUE-less <c>PIC X(4)</c> displayed four SPACES.
/// After this, every storage form added later inherits the background by construction, because there is exactly
/// one choke point to route through — and a drift test asserts the two arms agree.</para>
///
/// <para><b>⛔ THE DETERMINATION: what a fill CHARACTER means to a native carrier.</b> §11.9.10.4 GR5 makes the
/// specified-fill-character a CHARACTER, and §14.6.2.3.2 action 1 sets "the storage" to it. In a typed-native
/// model with no byte substrate a <c>long</c> / <c>Int128</c> / <c>float</c> / <c>double</c> field and an INDEX
/// cell have no character positions to receive one. The conforming realization, recorded rather than silently
/// chosen: <b>character-formed storage takes the fill; a native-numeric carrier and an index cell take their
/// zero.</b> The standard licenses exactly this — §13.18.63.4 GR4 c) says a VALUE-less item's initial content is
/// "undefined and set to a value that may or may not be allowed for that data item or index", so the fill is a
/// background over storage the standard does not otherwise constrain, and a carrier that cannot hold it takes
/// the value it can. Two further carve-outs, each from a RULE rather than from convenience:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item><b>Class object / message-tag / pointer take NULL, never the fill.</b> §13.18.63.4 GR4 c) states this
///     as a positive requirement — those items "are initialized to null" — in the same sentence that leaves
///     every other item undefined. A rule beats a background.</item>
///   <item><b>USAGE BIT keeps its packed zero seed</b> (D19 / kb/Work PB43). Its storage is ceil(n/8) PACKED
///     bytes laid out by the §8.5.1.6.3 walk, not a run of character positions, so a character fill has no
///     position to occupy. A DISPLAY-form boolean item DOES take the fill: under D-B1 its storage is one
///     alphanumeric character per boolean position, which is exactly what the background sets.</item>
/// </list>
