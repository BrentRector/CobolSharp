/// compile-time-directive operand of §7.3.11 / §13.10.3. Any operator, unary sign, or enclosing parenthesis
/// gives some node on the way down more than one child and stops the descent — which is exactly what all three
/// rules mean by "single".</para>

/// <para>⚠ IT REPLACED SIX COPIES OF ITSELF, and the last two were in DIFFERENT ASSEMBLIES, which is why the

/// helper is unreachable from <c>CompileTimeExpressionEvaluator</c>, which lives one layer down in
/// <c>Cobol.Net.Frontend</c>. The descent operates on PARSE TREES and on nothing else, so the frontend is where
/// it belongs and both layers can read it. The fifth copy was <c>IntrinsicBinder.SoleDataReference</c>, an
/// independently-written tier-by-tier list-pattern version that agreed with the others by coincidence rather
/// than by construction; the sixth was this file's former twin inside the compile-time evaluator.</para></summary>
