/// ⛔ THE TOKEN-LEVEL §8.9 RESERVATION GATE (kb/Work PB655). ISO §8.3.2.1 1): "Reserved words shall not be used as
/// user-defined words or system-names" — and §8.9 reserves a word per EDITION, so one lexer token (GOBACK, NULL,
/// ALTER, CONSTANT, …) is a keyword at some editions and a legal user-defined word at the others.
/// <para><b>Why it is not a predicate.</b> It was one: every such token was a <c>cobolWord</c> alternative behind
/// <c>{userWordHere("W")}?</c>. ANTLR evaluates a semantic predicate only at the LEFT EDGE of the decision it is
/// predicting, and <c>cobolWord</c> sits deep inside every reference — so for every ENCLOSING decision the gate was
/// invisible. At COBOL-2002, where NULL is reserved, <c>SET P TO NULL</c> chose the SET-to-identifier format on
/// the strength of a NULL "name" the gate then refused, and legal source failed to parse (measured: 115
/// Conformance reds when the PB655 words were admitted that way; <c>feedback_left_edge_predicates</c>).</para>
/// <para><b>What it is instead.</b> A gated word is never a <c>cobolWord</c> alternative; it stays its keyword
/// token, and its only grammar home is the generated <c>reservedGatedWord</c> rule that every DEFINITION slot
/// offers. A parse that matches it there at an edition where §8.9 leaves the word FREE has found a DECLARATION
/// (<see cref="CobolParserCoreBase.FreeGatedDeclarations"/>); this rewriter then retypes EVERY occurrence of that
/// word to <c>IDENTIFIER</c> and the source is parsed again, so the authoritative parse — every prediction in it —
/// sees a plain user-defined word. The SECOND witness is a syntax error whose offending token is such a free word
/// (<see cref="CobolParserCoreBase.NoteGatedOffender"/>): its keyword reading failed to parse, and the only other
/// reading §8.9 leaves it is a user-defined word — which is how a name introduced in a slot that does not offer
/// <c>reservedGatedWord</c> (an index-name, a SPECIAL-NAMES class-name) is reached. Where §8.9 RESERVES the word
/// nothing is retyped: no name slot can take the
/// keyword token, a reference fails with the targeted COBOLNET0901 (<see cref="CobolParserCoreBase.ReservedUserWordViolation"/>)
/// and a declaration draws it from the funnel.</para>
/// <para><b>Why DECLARED, not merely free.</b> The union grammar still spells the word's constructs at editions
/// that lack them, so the named edition gate can answer (<c>GOBACK.</c> at COBOL-85 → "requires COBOL-2002"), and
/// the migration mode (<c>--permissive</c>) admits a word the edition added while it is ALSO that edition's
/// keyword. A free word the program never declares can only be that keyword or an unresolvable reference; one it
/// declares is, per §8.3.2.1, a user-defined word — the same DETERMINATION PB805 recorded for operand lists
/// (<see cref="CobolParserCoreBase"/>'s <c>IsKeywordReadingHere</c>), now carried by the token itself.</para>
/// <para>The same decision must reach every re-parse of this group's text (the D18 subscript and D2 argument
/// fragments), which is why it travels as <see cref="TokenRetypes"/>. Design SSOT:
