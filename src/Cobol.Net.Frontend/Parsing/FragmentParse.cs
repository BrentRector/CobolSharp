/// <summary>
/// ⭐ THE ONE FRAGMENT RE-PARSE. Several places isolate a run of SOURCE TEXT and re-parse it through an isolated
/// fragment entry rule rather than growing a second expression compiler: the D18 subscript / reference-modifier
/// segment (<see cref="SubscriptExpressionFragment"/>), the D2 keyword-omitted argument list
/// (<see cref="FunctionArgFragment"/>) and the compile-time directive expression
/// (<see cref="DirectiveExpressionFragment"/>). Each needs the SAME five steps — lex the text, prime the lexer
/// for its region, normalize the token stream, parse at an edition, and return null on any syntax error — and
/// each had its own copy.

/// ⛔ THE COPIES DISAGREED, AND BOTH DISAGREEMENTS WERE DEFECTS (fix-queue PB50 + PB54). Exactly one of the
/// three applied <see cref="ZeroTokenRewriter"/>, which is what turns a figurative <c>ZERO</c> adjacent to an
/// arithmetic operator into the <c>ZERO_ARITH</c> token <c>arithmeticExpression</c> can match (§8.8.1.1 admits
/// "the figurative constant ZERO" as an arithmetic operand). The two that did not:
/// </para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Subscript / ref-mod</b> — <c>E(ZERO + 1)</c> could not parse, so the D18 route returned null and the
/// reference ABORTED AT RUN TIME on legal source (PB50). The queue entry blamed a missing arm in
/// <c>RenderSegment</c>'s token switch; PB42 had already widened that switch's <c>default:</c> to route
/// everything unrenderable here, so the arm was not the cause — this omission was.</item>
/// <item><b>Keyword-omitted arguments</b> — <c>MIN(ZERO + 5, 2)</c> returned <b>0</b> while
/// <c>FUNCTION MIN(ZERO + 5, 2)</c> returned 2, because the un-rewritten <c>ZERO</c> ended one argument and
/// <c>+ 5</c> began another. A SILENT WRONG ANSWER, and §8.4.3.2 SR2 makes the two spellings the same reference

/// safe for an argument-list fragment despite §8.4.3.2.3 SR6: the rewriter keys on adjacency to an arithmetic
/// operator or a PLAIN paren, and a fragment's text is the content BETWEEN its delimiters, so a bare <c>ZERO</c>
/// argument has no adjacent operator and keeps the figurative identity §8.3.3.6.4 GR4 requires the BINDER to
