/// The reverse map <c>keyword word → ANTLR lexer token type</c> — the question "what token does the lexer make
/// of this word?", answered for the <c>&gt;&gt;COBOL-WORDS</c> post-lex rewriter (retype IDENTIFIER→keyword for
/// EQUATE/SUBSTITUTE, keyword→IDENTIFIER for UNDEFINE/SUBSTITUTE) and for the compiler's SR3/SR4 category
/// validation. Intrinsic function names are NOT here — they are IDENTIFIERs (see <c>IntrinsicCatalog</c>), a
/// separate category.
/// <para><b>⛔ THE INVARIANT THIS CLASS USED TO ASSERT IS FALSE, AND THE FALSE ONE COST A SILENT BUG.</b> It
/// read "Every reserved word and context-sensitive word is a literal lexer token", and the whole map was built
/// from <see cref="Antlr4.Runtime.IVocabulary.GetLiteralName"/> alone. Measured against ISO §8.9 ∪ §8.10 (552
/// words), that walk reached 447: <b>17 words are lexed as a keyword token yet have no literal NAME</b>, because
/// ANTLR publishes a literal name only for a token defined by exactly ONE literal — a multi-spelling rule
/// (<c>ZERO : 'ZERO' | 'ZEROS' | 'ZEROES'</c>, <c>PIC : 'PICTURE' | 'PIC'</c>, the figurative plurals,
/// <c>IS</c>/<c>IN</c>/<c>OF</c>/<c>ALL</c>) publishes none, so <c>&gt;&gt;COBOL-WORDS UNDEFINE "ZERO"</c> was
/// silently inert. A further <b>88 words are no lexer token at all</b> (ANYCASE, LOCALE, HEX, NAT, ANUM, BYTE,
/// CURRENT, ACTIVATING, NESTED, STACK, TOP-LEVEL, the LC_ categories, UCS-4/UTF-8/UTF-16, …): those are
/// unreachable BY CONSTRUCTION here — no token type exists to retype — and are reached instead at the by-name
/// classification points through <see cref="CobolNet.Editions.CobolWordsMap.Resolve"/>. The two mechanisms
/// partition the population; neither alone covers it (kb/Work PB250).</para>
/// <para><b>The derivation is mechanical, so the next multi-spelling token is automatic</b> (no hand-maintained
/// list): the vocabulary walk is the fast path, and a miss falls back to <see cref="LexProbe"/> — running the
/// real lexer over the word itself and reading the type it produces. That is the same question asked of the same
/// authority, and it is cold: it runs only for a word a <c>&gt;&gt;COBOL-WORDS</c> directive actually names.
/// <c>CobolWordsReachDriftTests</c> pins both halves — every literal alternative in <c>CobolLexer.g4</c> resolves
