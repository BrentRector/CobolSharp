/// The D18 subscript / reference-modifier expression re-parse (fix-queue PB17; ISO §8.4.2.3.2 admits
/// <c>arithmetic-expression-1</c> as a subscript, §8.4.3.3.3 SR4 as a leftmost-position/length). A subscript
/// SEGMENT arrives at the binder as a flat SUBSCRIPT-mode token run that
/// <c>ReferenceResolver.RenderSegment</c> renders to C# text directly — a token renderer that handles literals,
/// data-names, index-names, the operators and parentheses, and nothing else. A segment it cannot render (today a
/// function-identifier) is re-lexed HERE from its verbatim source text and parsed through the ONE
/// <c>arithmeticExpression</c> rule, so it binds through <c>ExpressionBinder.BindExpr</c> — the documented entry
/// for subscripts — instead of growing a third hand-written expression compiler inside the renderer.
///
/// The DEFAULT lexer mode is used (the <see cref="DirectiveExpressionFragment"/> posture, NOT
/// <see cref="CobolLexer.PrimeFunctionArgs"/>): a subscript is not a function-argument region, so the
/// §8.3.3.3.2 sign-adjacent literal twins must not fire — inside a subscript <c>A -4</c> is the subtraction
/// §8.7.1 makes it, not two juxtaposed operands. The fragment parses at the CALLER's edition so a
/// function referenced in a subscript meets the same D8 introduction window it would meet anywhere else.
/// Any syntax error is a loud <see langword="null"/> — the caller keeps its existing not-implemented posture
/// rather than binding a partial parse.
