// ⛔ BY CONTENT TAKES AN EXPRESSION, AND OMITTING IT MIS-PARSED RATHER THAN FAILING TO PARSE (fix-queue PB46).
// The §14.9.23.2 general format's BY CONTENT branch admits `arithmetic-expression-1 | boolean-expression-1 |
// identifier-5 | literal-2` — read off the rendered figure, not the prose. With only `(dataReference | literal)`
// here, `INVOKE O "M" USING BY CONTENT N + 1` did not fail: `N` matched dataReference and `+ 1` started a
// SECOND invokeArgument, so the statement reported `COBOLNET0828: 2 USING argument(s) for 1 formal parameter(s)`
// — an arity diagnostic about a rule the program does not violate, which sends the reader at the method
// signature. A silent mis-parse is worse than a parse error.
// ⛔ `literal` FIRST, AND `dataReference` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT — both facts were learned by breaking them.
// `arithmeticExpression` SUBSUMES `dataReference` and every numeric literal, so an alternation listing them
// alongside it does not mean what it reads as (feedback_grammar_precedence: ANTLR takes the first matching
// alternative). A first cut wrote `(nonNumericLiteral | arithmeticExpression)` and silently DESTROYED the
// identifier path: `BY CONTENT A` began matching the expression arm, losing the §14.9.23.3 SR9/SR10 object-data
// rules, the §14.8.2.3.2 conformance check and the ref-mod handling — and `BY CONTENT "XY"` stopped binding at
// all. `literal` is kept because the proven literal arm keys on it; the identifier case is recovered IN THE
// BINDER from a sole-dataReference expression (OoBinder, the SoleDataReference shape ConditionBinder and
// IntrinsicBinder already use), because the grammar cannot express "a reference, unless it is part of an
// expression" without the ambiguity that caused the original defect.
// ⚠ BY VALUE keeps `arithmeticExpression` alone and does NOT gain the boolean arm: the format's BY VALUE branch
// is `arithmetic-expression-1 | identifier-5 | literal-2` — the two phrases genuinely differ, and only
// BY CONTENT carries boolean-expression-1.
// ⛔ `boolean-expression-1` IS A SEPARATE VALUE CHANNEL, NOT A THIRD SPELLING OF THE ARITHMETIC ONE (D-B1: a
// '0'/'1' bit-string world that never enters the numeric or DISPLAY channels), so it takes the proven
// {boolExprAhead()}? gate — the same predicate `primaryCondition` and `compileTimeOperand` use. Unguarded it is
// AMBIGUOUS with the arithmetic alternative, because `booleanExpression`'s leaf is `valueOperand`, which is
// `arithmeticExpression | nonNumericLiteral` — i.e. it matches every operand the other two arms match.
// ⚠ THE PREDICATE'S SCAN IS CONDITION-SHAPED AND CAN OVER-REACH HERE, BY DESIGN OF THE SHARED MECHANISM. It runs
// to the statement's period, so in `USING BY CONTENT N + 1 BY CONTENT B1 B-AND B2` the FIRST argument's decision
// already sees the SECOND argument's B-AND and takes this alternative. That is harmless and deliberately left
// harmless: the binder reduces a B-operator-FREE booleanExpression back to its bare `valueOperand` (the same
// UnwrapBareBool reduction BindPrimaryBoolean uses), so the predicate decides only which NODE an operand parses
// into, never what it MEANS. Narrowing the scan to the argument boundary would tighten a SHARED condition
// predicate for a local reason — the DEVLOG-621 lesson — and would buy nothing the reduction does not already
// guarantee.
// ⛔ THREE ARMS, AND PB130 RELAXED ONLY ONE OF THEM (kb/Work PB695 family 3 — the repo's most reproducible
// defect shape: a dispatch with two-or-more arms, one arm fixed). BY is un-underlined in ALL THREE printed
// phrases, so `USING REFERENCE X` and `USING CONTENT X` are conforming source that reached COBOL0001 while
// `USING VALUE N` already compiled. MEASURED on printed page 681 / folio 651, all three occurrences of BY:
// boxes 325.97–336.30, 325.96–336.30 and 325.90–336.24 — NONE of them has a horizontal rule in its band,
// while REFERENCE (96.3%), CONTENT (95.4%), VALUE (92.9%), OMITTED (95.0%), USING (92.8%) and RETURNING
// (96.2%) all carry one. §8.3.2.4.3. The same shape is already spelled `BY?` in CALL's three phrases
// (CobolParserCore.g4 callByReference / callByValue / callByContent) and in the procedure-division header
// (CobolData.g4), so this brings the last copy into line rather than inventing a posture.
// ⚠ NOTHING DOWNSTREAM KEYS ON `BY`: OoBinder.OoBindInvokeArg selects the passing mode from `arg.VALUE()`,
// `arg.REFERENCE()` and `arg.CONTENT()` — the UNDERLINED words — and VersionConformancePass
// .VisitInvokeArgument gates the boolean OPERATORS, not the phrase word. Verified by grep, not assumed.
// ⛔ OMITTED IS A BRACE ALTERNATIVE OUTSIDE THE [BY REFERENCE] BRACKET (kb/Work PB757). §14.9.23.2 prints
// `[ BY REFERENCE ] { identifier-3 | OMITTED }` — measured on printed folio 651: OMITTED underlined (95.0%), and
// the brace sits outside the bracket, so BOTH `USING BY REFERENCE OMITTED` and bare `USING OMITTED` are printed
// spellings (§5.2.6.2 brackets / §5.2.6.3 braces). §14.9.23.3 SR18 legislates the phrase by name. CALL's
// callByReference / callArgument have carried the same pair since PB130; this was the one consumer without it.
// OMITTED is a reserved word (§8.9), so neither arm shadows a data-name.
// ⛔ THE ADDRESS-IDENTIFIER ARM, IN EVERY PHRASE (kb/Work PB1021 — the INVOKE twin of PB239's CALL fix).
// §14.9.23.3 SR9: "Identifier-3 shall be an address-identifier or shall reference a data item defined in the file,
// working-storage, local-storage, or linkage section", and SR19 makes it a SENDING operand. identifier-5 (the
// BY CONTENT / BY VALUE operand) is an identifier too, and §8.4.3.1.2 identifier FORMAT 9 is an identifier, so
// the ONE `addressIdentifier` rule joins all four operand slots — exactly the four CALL's callArgument gives it.
// ADDRESS is reserved and heads no other alternative, so each arm is unambiguous and every spelling that parsed
// before parses identically.

// ⛔ THE FORMAT IS A TUPLE, NOT A SCALAR (kb/Work PB389). Rendered from the canonical PDF (printed folio 503 —
// the diagram is load-bearing and the transcription of a stacked bracket is exactly what was mis-read before):
//
//     OBJECT REFERENCE ⎡ interface-name-1                            ⎤
//                      ⎢ [ FACTORY OF ] ACTIVE-CLASS                 ⎥
//                      ⎣ [ FACTORY OF ] object-class-name-1 [ ONLY ] ⎦
//
// ONE bracket pair enclosing THREE stacked alternatives — so at most one is written, and the bare
// `OBJECT REFERENCE` is GR22 b)'s universal object reference. FACTORY, ACTIVE-CLASS and ONLY are UNDERLINED
// (required words of their alternatives); OF is not, so it is an OPTIONAL word (§5.2.3) and
// `OBJECT REFERENCE FACTORY ACTIVE-CLASS` is conforming — the rule required OF until kb/Work PB848's sibling sweep
// (the same REQUIRED-INSIDE-AN-OPTIONAL-GROUP shape as the pointer usages' TO). Four INDEPENDENT axes: kind ×
// FACTORY × ONLY × name.
//
// Until PB389 this rule had three alternatives carrying ONE axis (`FACTORY OF className` / `className` / bare),
// so ACTIVE-CLASS lexed as a user word and drew COBOLNET0813+0901, and a trailing ONLY was a raw COBOL0307.
//
// FACTORY/ONLY vs interface-name-1: the grammar CANNOT separate an interface-name from an object-class-name
// (both are one cobolWord), so the `[FACTORY OF] className [ONLY]` alternative is the SUPERSET parse (P3
// doctrine) and the binder makes the general-format rejection once the name resolves — COBOLNET1925.
// ACTIVE-CLASS is its own alternative because it IS its own token.
// `FACTORY OF?` is the same printed `[ FACTORY OF ]` bracket the PROCEDURE DIVISION header's `raisingTarget`
// carries — PB848's and PB815's sibling sweeps each found it independently.

// ── INLINE METHOD INVOCATION — ISO §8.4.3.4, an IDENTIFIER format (§8.4.3.1.2 Format 4) ──
// ⛔ THIS RULE USED TO WEAR THE NAME AND MATCH A DIFFERENT SHAPE (kb/Work PB428). It read
// `inlineMethodInvocationStatement : dataReference LPAREN argumentList? RPAREN` and was dispatched from
// `statement` under {is2023()}? — i.e. `id(args)` as a STATEMENT. The standard defines no such statement
// (§14.9's roster has none, and §8.4.3.4 sits in §8.4.3 *Identifiers*), and the real construct carries the
// §8.7.4 invocation operator, which had no lexer token at all. So the whole of Format 4 was a raw parse error
// in EVERY position, and the misnamed statement shape accepted source the standard does not define.
//
// MEASURED off the canonical PDF (printed page 133 / PDF page 163 — the general-format DIAGRAM is load-bearing
// and `scripts/render-spec-page.py 163` is what settled it, per CLAUDE.md rule 1):
//
//                                        ⎡   ⎧ arithmetic-expression-1 ⎫   ⎤

//
// OMITTED is the ONLY underlined word; `::` and the parentheses are required punctuation; the OUTER bracket
// makes the whole parenthesised argument list optional and the `…` repeats the brace group INSIDE the one pair.
//
// ⛔ THE RECEIVER IS `objectReference`, THE SAME RULE INVOKE'S RECEIVER USES — one activation mechanism, never a
// second (the dispatch's own words). §8.4.3.4.4 GR1 DEFINES this construct as the INVOKE statement it is
// equivalent to, so the two must not be able to disagree about what a receiver is: object-class-name-1 and
// identifier-1 are both one `dataReference` syntactically (the binder partitions them by resolved symbol kind,
// OoNameResolution.Lookup), and SELF/SUPER are §8.4.3.1.2 Format 6 identifiers of class object and therefore
// legal identifier-1s. NULL rides in too and is rejected LOUDLY by the binder per §8.4.3.4.3 SR2 ("neither the
// predefined object reference NULL nor a universal object reference shall be specified") — the P3 superset
// parse, never a general-format rejection dressed as a syntax error.
//
// ⛔ THE `::` SEGMENT REPEATS, because §8.4.3.1.3 SR1 says identifier is defined recursively ("whenever the
// format for an identifier allows another identifier to be specified, that other identifier may be any of the
// formats for an identifier, INCLUDING THE ONE BEING DEFINED"): the temporary an invocation references is
// itself an identifier-1, so `O :: "A" :: "B"` is conforming source. Writing the repetition here is what makes
// the recursion expressible without indirect left recursion through `objectReference`.
//
// ⚠ `refModPart*` mirrors `functionCall`'s tail and is derived, not copied: §8.4.3.1.4 GR1 orders the
// components — (e) the invocation operator applies "the literal method-name with optional arguments … on the
// right to the identifier on the left", THEN (g) "a reference modifier applies to the identifier on the left" —
// and §8.4.3.3.3 names no exclusion for an inline invocation (SR2 constrains a function-identifier, SR3 a
// ref-mod of a ref-mod). The two parenthesised tails stay disjoint on the COLON exactly as they do for
// functionCall, so no predicate is needed.
// ⚠ THE SEGMENT IS ITS OWN RULE so each `::` carries ITS OWN argument list: with the group written inline the
// generated context would expose FLAT `literal()` and `argumentList()` lists, and `A::"M"::"N"(X)` could not
// say which method the one argument belongs to.
