// `IDENTIFIER (IDENTIFIER|literal)*` matches ANY run of words, so wherever it sits in an alternative list it is a
// TOTAL SINK for everything the named alternatives missed. It used to be reached from SIX sites spanning EIGHT
// closed general formats — the data description entry (§13.16.2), the file description entry (§13.4.5.2), the
// sort-merge file description entry (§13.4.6.2), the file control entry (§12.4.5.1), the I-O-CONTROL paragraph
// (§12.4.6.2), the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph (§12.3.7.2), the configuration section (§12.3.2) and the
// identification division (§11.2.1) — under the name of a "vendor/extension hook". It is not one: a vendor
// extension is admitted only under the dialect that owns it, never by a catch-all, and this compiler declares no
// vendor dialect. What it actually did was SWALLOW a word run the format does not define, at every edition and
// every strictness, with no diagnostic anywhere — §4.2.2's warning obligation cannot be met for a construct the
// compiler never represents.
//
// Every one of those sites now spells `unrecognizedClause`, and `genericClause` is referenced from NOWHERE ELSE
// (`ClosedFormatDriftTests` derives that from these .g4 files and fails the build otherwise). The alternative is
// still RECOGNIZED rather than deleted, because recognizing it keeps recovery local — the rest of the entry, the
// paragraph and the division still parse, so the user gets ONE named error instead of a cascade of "no viable
// alternative". `Validation/ClosedFormatPass.cs` refuses every instance BY NAME, naming the format and its §.
// It must be the LAST alternative at every site: ANTLR takes the first matching alternative.

// AFTER the right-hand operand brace, `IN` is NOT underlined (an optional word, §5.2.3) and alphabet-name-1 is a

// ── REFERENCE-MODIFYING THE FUNCTION RESULT (fix-queue PB8, ISO §8.4.3.3.3 SR2) ────────────────────────────
// §8.4.3.1.2 Format 3 makes `identifier-1 reference-modifier-1` an IDENTIFIER, and §8.4.3.3.3 SR2 admits a
// function-identifier as identifier-1 ("If identifier-1 is a function-identifier, it shall reference an
// alphanumeric, boolean, or national function"). §8.4.3.1.4 GR1 fixes the order: (f) the argument list applies
// to the function-name on its left, THEN (g) "a reference modifier applies to the identifier on the left" — so
// the tail sits after the optional argument list, and BOTH of these are legal:
//     FUNCTION CURRENT-DATE (1:4)              -- zero-argument function, ref-modified
//     FUNCTION UPPER-CASE("abc") (1:2)         -- argument list, THEN ref-modified
// ⛔ NO LEXER CHANGE IS INVOLVED, and the fix-queue entry that said otherwise was wrong. A token dump of both
// shapes (pinned by CobolLexerModeDriftTests) shows the ref-mod paren lexed in DEFAULT mode in each case: after
// a function NAME the lexer's FUNCTION suppression already keeps it out of SUBSCRIPT mode, and after the
// argument list's ')' the previous token is not a data-name so the SUBSCRIPT trigger never fires. Both therefore
// reach the DEFAULT-mode refModPart (COLON, not SUB_COLON) that already exists for dataReference.
// ⚠ `refModPart*`, not `refModPart?`, and that is deliberate: §8.4.3.3.3 SR3 ("identifier-1 shall not be a
// reference-modification format identifier") forbids ref-modifying a ref-mod, and making the ARITY carry that
// rule here would enforce SR3 in a SECOND place — the data-reference side already counts ref-mods in
// ReferenceResolver, because `dataReferenceSuffix*` cannot express the limit either. One rule belongs in one
// place, so both sides parse the extra modifier and the binder rejects it with COBOLNET1630, giving the same
// cited message for FUNCTION F(X) (1:4)(1:2) as for A (3:4)(2:2) instead of a raw parse error on one side only.
// ⚠ The two alternatives are disjoint on the COLON and need no predicate: a functionArgList can never contain a
// DEFAULT-mode COLON (a nested data-item ref-mod inside an argument lexes SUB_COLON in SUBSCRIPT mode). §8.4.3.2
// SR6 — "if a function's definition permits arguments … the left parenthesis is ALWAYS … that function's
// arguments" — is a CATALOG question the grammar cannot answer, so the binder enforces it (IntrinsicBinder):
// a bare ref-mod directly after an argument-PERMITTING function name is an SR6/SR8 argument-list error.
// ── THE KEYWORD-OMITTED FORM FOR A RESERVED INTRINSIC NAME (fix-queue PB9) ────────────────────────────────
// §8.4.3.2.3 SR2 lets the word FUNCTION be omitted for any intrinsic the REPOSITORY declares. For an ordinary
// intrinsic name that omission is the D2 IRREDUCIBLE AMBIGUITY — `FOO(1)` is equally a subscripted data
// reference — so it has no grammar alternative and the binder re-routes a dataReference instead.
// ⛔ THAT ARGUMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO A RESERVED WORD, and that is the whole basis for this alternative: a
// reserved word can NEVER be a user-defined data name (§8.3.2.4.1), so `SUM(1 2 3)` cannot be a subscripted
// data reference and there is nothing to be ambiguous with. §8.9 ∩ §8.11 is exactly four words — LENGTH,
// RANDOM, SIGN, SUM. LENGTH already reaches the binder through the cobolWord name slot (it needs to be there
// for `START WITH LENGTH` anyway) and keeps that route; the other three arrive here.
// ⚠ WHY NOT JUST ADD THEM TO cobolWord LIKE LENGTH — this was tried and NIST NC116A caught it. A word in the
// name slot is admissible as a VALUE-clause literal (a constant-name), so the greedy literal list swallows a
// FOLLOWING data-description clause keyword:
//     01 W PICTURE S99999 VALUE ZERO
//            SIGN LEADING SEPARATE.        ->  COBOLNET1585 "takes exactly one literal"
// LENGTH is safe there only because LENGTH does not BEGIN a data-description clause; SIGN and SUM both do
// (§13.18.52 SIGN, §13.18.54 report-writer SUM). This alternative is confined to expression/operand positions and
// cannot reach a data description at all, so that whole class is structurally out of reach.
// ⚠ THE ARGUMENT LIST IS A `subscriptPart`, NOT `LPAREN functionArgList RPAREN`, and a token dump is what says
// so: these words carry subscriptTrigger=true, so with no FUNCTION keyword before them the lexer pushes
// SUBSCRIPT mode at the '(' and the arguments arrive as SUB_* tokens —
//     COMPUTE N = SUM(1 2 3)  ==>  COMPUTE IDENTIFIER EQUALS SUM LPAREN SUB_INTEGERLIT×3 SUB_RPAREN
// which is exactly the D2 carrier the keyword-omitted form already uses. The binder therefore re-parses it
// through the SAME `ReparseArgs` → `functionArgListFragment` path as every other keyword-omitted reference,
// rather than growing a second argument grammar. (Pinned by CobolLexerModeDriftTests.)
// ⛔ THE ARGUMENT GROUP IS REQUIRED FOR SIGN AND SUM, AND THAT IS WHAT KEEPS THIS SAFE — it is derived from the
// functions' own general formats, not an ad-hoc guard. §15.81.2 writes `FUNCTION SIGN ( argument-1 )` and
// §15.88.2 `FUNCTION SUM ( { argument-1 } … )`: neither has a no-argument form, so a BARE `SIGN` or `SUM` is
// never a function reference. Requiring the group is what stops the collision NIST NC116A found:
//     01 W PICTURE S99999 VALUE ZERO
//            SIGN LEADING SEPARATE.
// A VALUE clause operand is a `unaryExpression`, which reaches functionCall, and the operand loop is greedy —
// so admitting a BARE SIGN made the loop swallow the SIGN CLAUSE of the NEXT line as a second VALUE literal
// (COBOLNET1585). With the group required, `SIGN LEADING` cannot match a functionCall at all and the loop stops
// where it should. The same applies to the report-writer `SUM OF` clause (§13.18.54).
// RANDOM is different and needs no group: §15.75.2 brackets the whole parenthesised part, so the bare form is
// legal — and RANDOM begins no data-description clause, so nothing can swallow it.
// ⛔ THE ARGUMENT-LIST PARENS ARE FNARG_LPAREN / FNARG_RPAREN, NOT LPAREN / RPAREN (fix-queue PB48). §8.4.3.2.3
