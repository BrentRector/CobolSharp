// It used to END in `genericDataClause -> genericClause : IDENTIFIER (IDENTIFIER|literal)*`, a vendor-extension
// catch-all that swallowed ANY word sequence at the tail of an entry. Three harms followed from that ONE
// alternative, and all three are the same harm: a word the grammar does not know was DISCARDED rather than
// diagnosed.
//   (a) the §13.18.1 ALIGNED clause — a REAL clause of this general format with no rule of its own — parsed and
//       did nothing, so `05 B2 PIC 1(4) USAGE BIT ALIGNED.` laid out at the WRONG bit offset in silence;
//   (b) the bare (USAGE IS-less) `01 M MESSAGE-TAG.` that §13.18.60.2 makes legal bound with NO usage, and the
//       missing PicInfo escaped the binder into an unhandled NullReferenceException in MoveEmitter;
//   (c) every "…the only other clauses permitted are…" rule of §13.16.3 (SR12/SR13/SR17/SR18) was unenforceable
//       against a word the parser never classified, however carefully its condition list was maintained.

// but `Validation/ClosedFormatPass.cs` REFUSES it BY NAME (COBOLNET1941 for this format) at every edition and

// that owns it, never by a catch-all, and this compiler declares no vendor dialect. It is LAST because ANTLR
// takes the first matching alternative.

// `01 P USAGE POINTER BIT.` bound BIT as a type-name (MEASURED — PointerUsageOperandDriftTests caught it), as would
