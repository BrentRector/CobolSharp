// "SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph: LOCALE clause and LOCALE phrases in the ALPHABET clause (12.3.7)" — and COBOL.NET's
// documented non-support of the locale module is conformant per §4.2.7 / §A.4.1 ONLY if it is DIAGNOSED. The
// binder emits COBOLNET1518, the same cited message the LOCALE phrase of LOWER-CASE / NUMVAL-C already gets; a
// raw parse error is not documented non-support, it is an unexplained rejection. Superset-parse / bind-narrow,
// exactly as the rest of this grammar does it.
// ⚠ The predicate is EDITION-GATED (2002+, where §8.9 reserves LOCALE). At COBOL-85 LOCALE is an ordinary user
// word, so `SPECIAL-NAMES. LOCALE IS FOO.` is a legal implementor-switch entry and must keep parsing as one —

// `cobolWord`, whose §8.9 funnel refuses the word position-blind at 2002+), and so is TABLE, so the clause is
// recognized by its own two keywords and needs no text predicate: the retired `{orderTableAhead()}?` read the
// same word pair by text only because ORDER had no token.
// literal-9 names the cultural ordering table (§12.3.7.4 GR17 — "The implementor specifies the allowable content
// of literal-9"); ordering-name-1 "may be specified only in the STANDARD-COMPARE intrinsic function"
// (§12.3.7.3 SR9). The binder (DataBinder.OrderTableBind) enforces SR10/SR11 and registers the name.
// ⚠ NOT edition-gated, unlike localeClause: TABLE is reserved at EVERY edition, so the pair ORDER + TABLE has no
// competing COBOL-85 reading (nothing else in a SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph can be followed by, or begin with, TABLE)
// — and at 85, where §8.9 leaves ORDER user-definable, the word still reaches `implementorSwitchEntry` through
// `cobolWord`'s gated alternative, so a switch entry named ORDER keeps its '85 reading. This alternative stays
// AHEAD of implementorSwitchEntry in specialNamesEntry so `ORDER TABLE …` is never absorbed as a switch-name.
