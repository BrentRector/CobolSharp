/// <summary>
/// The COBOL.NET <c>&gt;&gt;PROPAGATE</c> directive stage (ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §7.3.21): the directive controls
/// AUTOMATIC propagation of an unhandled exception condition to the activating runtime element (GR1/GR2 — as though
/// a <c>GOBACK RAISING LAST</c> were executed), scoped over the functions/methods/programs that follow in the
/// compilation group; the default is <c>PROPAGATE OFF</c> (GR4). <b>§7.3.21.3 SR1 (the directive shall not be
/// specified WITHIN a compilation unit) is NOT enforced</b> — this pre-parse, line-based stage has no
/// compilation-unit-boundary awareness, and blanking the line before parsing means no downstream stage can catch a
/// misplaced directive, so a <c>&gt;&gt;PROPAGATE</c> inside a unit is recognized and consumed. A documented
/// limitation (a placement-diagnostic follow-up), not a silent mis-compile of well-placed source.
/// <para>This stage RECOGNIZES the directive and EDITION-GATES it (the introduction gate). Its INTRODUCTION edition
/// is PROVISIONAL COBOL-2002 (the roadmap decision-1 policy, as for TYPEDEF / the FLOAT trio): §7.3.21 is live in
/// the 2023 spec — Annex E lists no removal — and it belongs to the 2002-era EC / compiler-directive facility (the
/// same era as <c>&gt;&gt;TURN</c>, gated at 2002), but the exact 2002-vs-2014 edge cannot be pinned from the 2023
/// text or the VCR; refine against the 1989:2002 standard when available. The RUNTIME semantics (actually driving
/// EC propagation) are the deferred PHASE-13 EC-remnant work — this stage does NOT implement them, so a
/// well-formed <c>&gt;&gt;PROPAGATE ON</c> is recognized-and-edition-gated but does not yet change EC behavior; it
/// is never a silent stray token nor a parse error. The line is blanked (line-count preserving, so every later
/// token line number is stable — the <c>&gt;&gt;TURN</c> H3 discipline).</para>
