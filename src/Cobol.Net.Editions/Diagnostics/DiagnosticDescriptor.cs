/// Which of the standard's two "need not implement" annexes lists the language element a DECLINED-FACILITY
/// diagnostic refuses or warns about. This is the datum that DECIDES which clause licenses the posture, and until
/// kb/Work PB709 it existed only as free text inside <see cref="DiagnosticDescriptor.Title"/> and
/// <see cref="DiagnosticDescriptor.IsoSection"/> — where a §4.2.6 written at an Annex A.4 site is a REAL citation
/// quoting REAL text that answers a DIFFERENT question, so <c>audit_code_citations.py --check</c> passes and the
/// wrong clause propagates into the next comment, golden and DEVLOG paragraph that inherits it.
///
/// <para>⛔ THE TWO CLAUSES ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE, and the difference is normative rather than editorial.
/// ISO §4.2.6 (Annex A.3, <i>processor-dependent</i> language elements) carries TWO sentences nothing else in the
/// standard carries: "An implementation shall provide a warning mechanism at compile time to indicate use of
/// syntactically-detectable processor-dependent language elements not supported by that implementation", and
/// "it is not required to diagnose syntax errors within this unsupported syntax". ISO §4.2.7 (Annex A.4,
/// <i>optional</i> language elements) has NEITHER: it makes the element one an implementor "may, but need not,
/// implement", requires only that the claim be identified in user documentation, and Annex A.4.1 then admits the
/// syntax "only when support for that language element is claimed by the implementor". So an A.3 decline is
/// accept-and-WARN <i>because the standard mandates the warning</i>; an A.4 decline is refuse-by-name <i>because
/// accepting unclaimed syntax is itself the non-conformance</i> — and the permissive-inside/exact-at-the-edges
/// parse an A.3 decline gets for free is, at an A.4 site, a consequence of the element not being part of this
/// implementation at all rather than of any excusing sentence.</para>
///
/// <para>A facility CAN be listed in BOTH — commit and rollback is Annex A.3 items 6-7 <i>and</i> Annex A.4.3 —
/// so this is a flags enum and not a choice.</para>
