/// The first-class compiler-diagnostic catalogue (rearch PHASE 02, P2.10). ONE home, below both the frontend and
/// the compiler, for the diagnostics that used to be bare <c>COBOLNETnnnn</c> string literals: the edition band
/// (single-sourced from <see cref="EditionCodes"/>), the digit-capacity codes, the reused <c>COBOLNET1533</c>
/// strong-type rules split by ISO §, and — the bulk — the <c>COBOLNET0899</c> "recognized but not implemented"
/// catch-all, split into one addressable descriptor per deferred feature / per validation rule.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>The 0899 split (fixes P8).</b> <c>COBOLNET0899</c> was emitted from ~44 sites conflating two categories:
/// (a) LEGAL-but-not-yet-implemented features (national data, several Report Writer clauses, OO refinements) and
/// (b) genuine SEMANTIC VALIDATION errors that happen to share the code (an unresolved Report Writer CONTROL /
/// SOURCE / SUM operand, a receiving-side LINE-COUNTER, …). Every site now references a descriptor here. The
/// emitted CODE stays <c>COBOLNET0899</c> (byte-stable — goldens and the differential net pin the text), but each
/// site is now addressable by a stable <see cref="DiagnosticDescriptor.Id"/>. The DEFERRALS carry the shared
/// <see cref="RecognizedNotImplemented"/> suppress family so a developer can mute all "not implemented yet"
/// diagnostics at once WITHOUT also muting the validation errors; the validation descriptors keep the default
/// (suppress-by-code) family. Reclassifying the validation errors onto proper per-rule codes (out of the 0899
/// bucket) is a tracked follow-on (P3 validator work) — it changes emitted codes, so it re-baselines goldens
/// under review and is out of P2's byte-stable scope.
/// </para>

/// <b>Reused-code disambiguation.</b> <c>COBOLNET1533</c> is emitted for THREE distinct strong-type rules
/// (§14.9.25.3 SR2 MOVE, §8.8.4.4.3 SR1 class condition, §8.8.4.2.3 SR1 comparison). Each now has its own

    //    · STANDARD-1 is PROCESSOR-DEPENDENT — Annex A.3 item 26, "The STANDARD-1 phrase of the RECORD
    //      DELIMITER clause is dependent upon a reel type of device", and §12.4.5.11.4 GR2 spells the
    //      dependency as a requirement on the run: "If STANDARD-1 is specified, the external medium shall be a
    //      tape drive." COBOL.NET provides no reel device (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §2 rows 28-30, 33-34), so
    //      §12.4.5.11.4 GR3's ISO/IEC 1001:2012 7.1.2 framing cannot be reached.
    //    · feature-name-1 is IMPLEMENTOR-DEFINED and OPTIONAL — Annex A.1 item 150, "This item is optional",
    //      whose licence is A.1's preamble ("Optional: The element may be provided at the implementor's
    //      option"). §12.4.5.11.3 SR2 makes the available names the implementor's to specify and this
    //      implementation specifies NONE (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §7, A.1 item 150), so §12.4.5.11.4 GR4 has no
    //      method to associate with any spelling.
    //    ACCEPT-INERT (Warning), not refuse, and §12.4.5.11.4 GR1 is why the accept is safe where an inert
    //    FORMAT clause (1705) is not: "Any method used shall not be reflected in the record area or the record
    //    size used within the function, method, or program" — the framing is invisible to the program's data,
    //    so a declined RECORD DELIMITER leaves every program-visible value identical to the conforming one and
    //    the file still round-trips through §12.4.5.11.4 GR5's implementor method (the 4-byte length prefix,
    //    A.1 item 151, docs/CONFORMANCE.md §7). §4.2.6 ¶3 then makes the warning MANDATORY rather than a house
    //    style: "An implementation shall provide a warning mechanism at compile time to indicate use of
    //    syntactically-detectable processor-dependent language elements not supported by that implementation."
    //    ⚠ §4.2.6 ¶3's next sentence — "it is not required to diagnose syntax errors within this unsupported
    //    syntax" — is the express licence for NOT enforcing §12.4.5.11.3 SR1 (the clause "may be specified only
    //    for variable-length records") inside the declined clause. That is a decision, not an omission: SR1's
    //    own NOTE makes variable-length-ness partly an implementor determination (A.1 items 147-148, still
    //    open), and a line-sequential file's records are variable by §9.1.7.2 with no RECORD clause at all, so
    //    an SR1 test keyed on FileModel.Varying would REJECT LEGAL SOURCE to enforce a rule the standard
