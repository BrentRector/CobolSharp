/// THE parse of a compiler-directive LINE — the compiler-directive indicator, the compiler-directive word that
/// heads it, and the operand text that follows (kb/Work PB794).
///
/// <para>ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §7.3.2 gives ONE general format for every directive — <c>&gt;&gt;compiler-instruction</c>
/// — and §7.3.3 says what surrounds it: SR2, a directive is preceded only by spaces; SR5, the indicator is
/// "optionally followed by the COBOL character space … The compiler directive indicator shall be treated as
/// though it were followed by a space if no space is specified after the indicator"; SR3/SR4, a directive "may be
/// followed only by space characters and an optional inline comment". That is one fact about every directive
/// line, and before PB794 it was written SEVEN times — <c>ConditionalCompilationProcessor.SplitDirective</c> plus
/// a hand-rolled <c>trimmed[2..].TrimStart()</c> in each of the PROPAGATE, LEAP-SECOND, REF-MOD-ZERO-LENGTH,
/// COBOL-WORDS, TURN and FLAG stages, and an end-anchored regex in the reference-format normalizer. Six of the
/// seven copies knew nothing about the inline comment, so <c>&gt;&gt;PROPAGATE ON *> on</c> was REJECTED and
/// <c>&gt;&gt;SOURCE FORMAT FIXED *> switch</c> was not recognized at all — the following segment was then read
/// in the wrong reference format and the error surfaced on a line the user had not written wrong.</para>
///
/// <para>⛔ A trailing PERIOD is not tolerated. SR3/SR4 admit space characters and an inline comment after the
/// directive and nothing else; the reference-format regex used to allow <c>&gt;&gt;SOURCE FORMAT FREE.</c> while
/// every operand-checking stage already rejected the same spelling on its own directive. One rule, one place:
/// the period reaches <see cref="CompilerDirectiveCatalog.CheckOperand"/> as part of the operand and is
