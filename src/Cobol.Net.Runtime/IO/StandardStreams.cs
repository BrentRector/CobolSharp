/// THE process-wide rule for what COBOL.NET puts on stdout and stderr: <b>UTF-8, always, everywhere</b> — one
/// rule, one place, called by every entry point this product has.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The repertoires are UTF-16 (CONFORMANCE.md §7 item 188) and the alphanumeric↔national correspondence is the
/// total identity (item 33), so the DEVICE boundary must carry the repertoire or every wide character silently
/// becomes mojibake at the OS code page — a data loss no rule authorizes. The standard display device therefore
/// writes UTF-8 (CONFORMANCE.md §7 item 59; the PB59 landing), and <c>ProcessObserver</c> in the test harness
/// decodes every capture the same way.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⛔ WHY IT IS A SHARED HELPER AND NOT AN <c>if</c> (kb/Work PB899). The rule was written down in exactly one of
/// the two places that needed it: <c>ProgramTable.RunMain</c> set the encoding for a RUN program, and the
/// <c>cobol</c> CLI's diagnostic path set nothing at all. On a default Windows console that is cp437, so the
/// section sign in <c>(ISO §11.10.3 SR5–6)</c> left the process as the single byte <c>0x15</c> and the en dash
/// as <c>-</c> — measured, byte-for-byte, through a redirected stream. Every ISO citation the compiler prints
/// was corrupted in every CI log and every redirected capture, and no golden could see it because the corpus
/// runner matches <c>.err</c> files on a pure-ASCII diagnostic CODE substring. That is
/// <c>feedback_two_arm_dispatch</c>, the most reproducible defect shape in this repository: a dispatch with two
/// arms, one of them fixed. There is now ONE arm.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Idempotent and defensive: the work happens once per process, and a host with no console at all (where the
/// <see cref="Console.OutputEncoding"/> setter raises <see cref="IOException"/>) still gets UTF-8, through
/// explicit writers over the standard handles. Setting <see cref="Console.OutputEncoding"/> re-creates BOTH
/// <see cref="Console.Out"/> and <see cref="Console.Error"/>, which is why diagnostics — written to stderr —
/// are covered by the same call.
