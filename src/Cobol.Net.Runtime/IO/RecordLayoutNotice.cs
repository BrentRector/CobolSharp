/// <summary>
/// The RUNTIME notice channel for a file whose bytes are PROVABLY inconsistent with the record description that
/// is about to read them — the support half of the V59 representation change (COBOLNET_DESIGN §14.4).
/// <para>
/// Why this exists: a fixed-length record-sequential file carries NO self-description IN ITS BYTES. If the record
/// description says 5 bytes and the file holds 8-byte records — the shape a data file written by a build before
/// V59 has, when a BINARY or PACKED field was stored as its zoned digits — every read after the first is
/// misaligned and the program computes on rubbish. The standard's own detection (§14.9.30.4 GR14: a record whose
/// byte count is outside the description's min/max is a SUCCESSFUL read with I-O status '04') fires only on the
/// trailing partial record, only if the total length is not a multiple, and only if the program inspects FILE
/// STATUS. That is too late and too quiet for a layout migration, so the arithmetic fact — a file length that is
/// not a whole multiple of the fixed record length — is reported at OPEN, before a single record is misread.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⛔ THIS IS THE ONLY MECHANISM FOR A SEQUENTIAL RECORD-SIZE DISAGREEMENT, and it is not in competition with
/// the OPEN statement's attribute check. A file COBOL.NET created carries its §9.1.6 fixed file attributes in a
/// <see cref="FixedFileAttributes"/> catalog beside it, but the §14.9.27.4 GR10 validated set that catalog
/// defines deliberately EXCLUDES the record sizes of a SEQUENTIAL file (see
/// <see cref="FixedFileAttributes.Conflicts"/>): §9.1.7.2 makes those lengths a property of the data and of the
/// reading program, and §9.1.13.2 item 3 answers a disagreement with a successful '04' rather than a refused
/// OPEN — so GR10's '39' never fires here and never preempts this notice. GR10 covers the disagreements a
/// sequential re-read CANNOT recover from (a relative or indexed store opened as a byte stream, a
/// different-organization description); this notice covers the one it can, on both a recorded and an
/// unrecorded file. One job, one mechanism, on either side of the organization boundary.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It is a NOTICE, not a status change: OPEN still succeeds and the I-O status is untouched, because the standard
/// defines no OPEN condition for this and inventing one would be non-conforming. It goes to STANDARD ERROR so a
/// program's own output (which goldens compare) is never disturbed.
