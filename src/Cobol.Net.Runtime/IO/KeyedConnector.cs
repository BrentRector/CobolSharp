/// That premise is now ENFORCED rather than assumed: until kb/Work PB692 the rule had no check anywhere and

/// existing was a comment about source the compiler accepted. <c>DataBinder.BindFileControl</c> screens it on

/// connector has no access mode" a fact about every program that reaches the runtime.

/// ⛔ INVARIANT (kb/Work PB325) — <b>the OPEN MODE never SELECTS a keyed verb's branch; it is only ever
/// SCREENED.</b> Every branch the standard draws inside a keyed verb is drawn on the ACCESS MODE:
/// §14.9.51.4 GR29 a)/b) (relative WRITE: consecutive release vs. the staged RELATIVE KEY), GR38/GR39 (indexed
/// WRITE: the ascending-prime-key requirement vs. "in any order"), §14.9.35.4 GR5 vs. GR21/GR22/GR23 and
/// §14.9.10.4 GR2 vs. GR3/GR4 (REWRITE/DELETE target: the last-read record vs. the key item's). The OPEN MODE
/// enters only as the permission test that follows — §14.9.27.4 GR8's Table 20, whose unsuccessful cells
/// §9.1.13.7 items 8 and 9 name ('48' for WRITE, '49' for REWRITE/DELETE) — and item 8's own two arms are
/// themselves selected BY the access mode: a) sequential ⇒ extend or output, b) random or dynamic ⇒ I-O or
/// output.
///
/// Folding the open mode into a branch predicate ("sequential access <i>or</i> extend mode") therefore inverts
/// the dependency and makes the runtime's answer depend on a bind-time screen holding: §14.9.27.3 SR2 confines
/// EXTEND to sequential access, so a random- or dynamic-access connector open in the extend mode is a state the
/// SOURCE cannot legally reach — but the runtime must still answer '48' for it (Table 20 leaves the
/// Random/Extend and Dynamic/Extend WRITE cells blank), not divert into the sequential-release branch and
