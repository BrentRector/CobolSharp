/// COBOL.NET's DERIVED collation table: every Unicode code point (or contraction — a sequence of code points that
/// collates as a unit) → its sequence of <see cref="CollationElement"/>s. The <see cref="Root"/> table is generated
/// from the Unicode CLDR root collation and UCA data by <c>scripts/collation/generate-collation-table.py</c>
/// (sources, versions and hashes in <c>Data/root-collation.manifest.json</c>; the pinned inputs live under
/// <c>data/unicode/</c>) and is embedded in this assembly, so every COBOL.NET program on every host orders text
/// identically — the order does not depend on the ICU build the operating system happens to ship.
/// <para>A table answers three questions the collation engine asks while walking a string: the elements of a code
/// point (<see cref="GetElements"/>; explicit mappings, plus the two computed families — Hangul syllables through
/// their conjoining jamo, and the UTS #10 Table 16 IMPLICIT weights of Han/Tangut/Nushu/Khitan ideographs and of
/// unassigned code points), the contractions that begin with a code point (Thai/Lao prevowel + consonant, tailored
/// digraphs …), and whether a code point is a NON-STARTER (canonical combining class ≠ 0 — the trigger for canonical
/// reordering and discontiguous contraction matching). It also carries the CLDR root's REORDERING GROUPS
/// (<see cref="ReorderGroups"/>: space, punct, symbol, currency, digit, then one group per script, each a contiguous
/// primary range) — what a CLDR <c>[reorder …]</c> permutes and <see cref="MaxVariable"/> reads.</para>
/// <para>Tables are IMMUTABLE. A tailoring does not mutate a table; it produces a NEW table — <see cref="WithTailoring"/>
/// for a numeric <see cref="TailoringRules"/> file, <see cref="Rebuild"/> for the CLDR rule builder — that shares
/// nothing mutable with its base, so a run unit can hold the root table and any number of locale-tailored tables side
/// by side. A tailored table's weights may be RENUMBERED relative to the root's (a CLDR relation that needs room
/// between two adjacent root weights widens that gap; a <c>[reorder]</c> moves whole groups); the table's
/// <see cref="PrimaryMap"/> / <see cref="SecondaryMap"/> / <see cref="TertiaryMap"/> record the root → this-table
/// mapping so a root-scale weight (a <c>.tailor</c> file's) can still be layered on top correctly.</para>
