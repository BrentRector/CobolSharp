/// weight triple of the Unicode Collation Algorithm (UTS #10) — the same three-level shape ISO/IEC 14651's Common
/// Template Table uses — plus the element's VARIABLE marking, which decides its treatment under
/// <see cref="AlternateHandling.Shifted"/> (space, punctuation and symbols are variable; letters and digits are not).
/// <para>Weights are DERIVED values, not raw source values: the generator re-scales every primary by
/// <c>1 &lt;&lt; CollationTable.PrimaryShift</c> so a tailoring can place a character strictly between two adjacent root
/// primaries (Spanish ñ between n and o) without renumbering the table; secondaries and tertiaries carry the
/// source values. Order is preserved exactly. A weight of 0 at a level means "ignorable at that level" — a completely
/// ignorable element (all three zero, e.g. a control character) contributes nothing to any key level.</para>
