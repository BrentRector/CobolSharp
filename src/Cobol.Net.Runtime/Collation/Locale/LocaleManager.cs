/// <summary>
/// The locale SELECTION system of the collation subsystem (kb/Work PB101 section D, PB105): select a locale by tag,
/// load its collation — the CLDR collation of the tag (<see cref="CldrLocaleLoader"/> →
/// <see cref="CldrTailoringBuilder"/>), then the site's numeric <c>.tailor</c> rules on top — and make the engine
/// collate by it, for the run unit that is current.
/// <para><b>Where the state lives.</b> There is exactly ONE current-locale state in COBOL.NET: the run unit's
/// <see cref="LocaleState"/> (<c>RunUnit.Current.Locale</c>, ISO/IEC 1989:2023 §8.2.1 / §14.6.6 — DESIGN-locale-facility
/// §4.3). <see cref="SetLocale"/> writes it (every category, the <c>SET LOCALE LC_ALL</c> shape) and
/// <see cref="CurrentLocale"/> reads its LC_COLLATE category; the LOCALE-based collating sequence
/// (<see cref="LocaleCollation.Current"/> — an <c>ALPHABET … IS LOCALE</c> program collating sequence, a SORT/MERGE or file
/// key sequence) resolves that same state at each use, so a selection made here is what a running COBOL program's
/// locale-based comparisons see. This class adds no second store.</para>
/// <para><b>How a locale's collation is built.</b> Tables are immutable: selecting a locale never mutates the root
/// table. <see cref="CollationEngine.ResolveLocale"/> does the work once per tag and caches it: the CLDR collation
/// the tag means (its file along the parent chain, its <c>-u-co-</c> type, its settings and the tag's <c>-u-</c>
/// keys) is built into a tailored table over the root, and a <c>.tailor</c> for the tag or its language (a file in
/// <c>COBOL_COLLATION_DIR</c>, in <c>Collation/</c> or <c>Collation/Locales/</c> beside the application, or one embedded
/// in this assembly — exact tag, then language) is layered on top; the result is a table + settings per locale,
/// shared and cached, never a global mutation — a run unit may use several locales at once (a SORT under one, a file
/// under another).</para>
/// <para><b>Validation.</b> A tag is accepted when it is the root, has a CLDR collation file of its own, has
/// <c>.tailor</c> rules (its own or its language's), or is a culture .NET recognizes ("es-419", "nb-NO" — it then
/// collates by its CLDR parent chain: es.xml, no.xml; a locale no data covers, by the root order — the CLDR order for
/// English, German, Italian …); anything else is a <see cref="CultureNotFoundException"/>
/// (<see cref="CollationEngine.IsKnownLocale"/> — the ONE rule; the CLDR parent chain alone never makes a tag known,
/// or "no-Such-TABLE" would be Norwegian). Tags are normalized to the hyphen form.</para>
/// <para><b>Start-up.</b> No call is required: a run unit's <see cref="LocaleState"/> initializes itself from the L2
/// defaults (owner decision Q2 — <c>COBOL_USER_LOCALE</c>, else the process culture, else the root) when the run unit
/// is created, and <see cref="CollationRuntime"/> wires the subsystems together. A host that wants to override that
/// for the program it is about to run calls <c>LocaleManager.SetLocale("es-ES")</c> before invoking the program's
/// entry point (the compiled <c>Main</c> needs no change); the future <c>SET LOCALE</c> statement (design increment T1)
/// writes the same <see cref="LocaleState"/>.</para>
