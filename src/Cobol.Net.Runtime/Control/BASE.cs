// ⛔ THE TYPE NAMES ARE A WIRE CONTRACT. The compiler emits a COBOL class-name as its sanitized, uppercased
// spelling (ObjectRefDescriptor.ClrTypeName) and a factory object's type as that name plus "__FACTORY"
// (NamingConvention.FactorySuffix). Naming the standard class's implementation BASE / BASE__FACTORY is what lets
// `CLASS-ID. C INHERITS FROM BASE`, `USAGE OBJECT REFERENCE BASE` and `FACTORY OF BASE` name these types with no
// special case in the emitter. Emitted code lives in the global namespace and imports CobolNet.Runtime, so a
// compilation group that DEFINES its own class BASE shadows these (a global-namespace type wins over a using-
// imported one) — the same precedence OoClassTable.Find gives a group definition over the standard class.
