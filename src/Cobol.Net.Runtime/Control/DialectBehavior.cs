/// <summary>
/// ⛔ THE NAMED BEHAVIOUR CHANGES BETWEEN ISO COBOL EDITIONS — the BEHAVIOUR twin of
/// <c>CobolNet.Editions.ConstructRegistry</c> (kb/Work PB344). A registry row there answers "does this edition
/// HAVE this construct?" and produces a diagnostic; a member here answers "which edition's RULE does this
/// construct obey?" and produces an ANSWER. Both questions arise on every edition-varying feature and they are
/// NOT the same question: the source of a behaviour change is legal at every edition, so no diagnostic can
/// carry it.
/// <para>⛔ <b>THE ADMISSION TEST FOR A MEMBER</b> (kb/Work PB344, earned by a member that had to be withdrawn).
/// Annex E is INFORMATIVE and, per §E.1, lists "the substantive changes between <b>the previous COBOL
/// standard</b> and this Working Draft International Standard" — ONE prior edition, the 2014 one. An E.2 item is
/// therefore evidence about a prior edition's RULES only when it says what the prior rule STATED; where its
/// justification says instead that the previous standard "was not clear or missing processing" — i.e. the prior
/// text was SILENT, and each sub-item adds "This appears to be an error in previous standards" — there is no
/// prior behaviour to serve, silence is not a prohibition, and the 2023 rule stands at every edition. Item 19
/// a)/b) (the open-mode USE tier) failed that test and is NOT a member: the 1985 edition's own validation suite
/// requires the opposite of what a gate would have produced (NIST CCVS SQ122A/SQ136A/SQ137A/SQ138A/SQ148A).
/// Item 22 below passes it — "the rule itself stated that the first record would be retrieved".</para>
/// <para>Each member names one row of <c>docs/VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE.md</c> Table 1 whose action is
/// <c>gate-behavior-by-dialect</c>. The row's <c>&lt;!-- gate:… --&gt;</c> marker is this member's
/// <see cref="DialectBehaviors.Row.Id"/>, which is how the drift test
/// (<c>DialectBehaviorRegistryDriftTests</c>) proves the two registers still agree — a member with no row, or a
/// row whose marker names no member, fails the build's test gate rather than rotting.</para>
/// <para>⛔ IT LIVES IN THE RUNTIME, NOT IN <c>Cobol.Net.Editions</c>, for the same reason
/// <c>SignEncoding</c> does: BOTH sides need it. The emitter folds a behaviour that is decided at COMPILE time
/// (it knows <c>--std</c>, so a suppressed branch is never rendered), and the generated program's connectors
/// ask it at RUN time for a behaviour that is decided inside the runtime's own walk — over the edition the
/// COMPILATION baked into them (<c>FileConnector.Edition</c>). <c>Cobol.Net.Editions</c> is a leaf that the
/// runtime does not reference, so putting it there would force either a project-reference inversion or a
/// SECOND copy of the table.</para>
