/// (kb/Work PB970 arm 2; <c>docs/CONFORMANCE.md</c> §7 DOC-A.1-216). A pointer's VALUE is a managed reference
/// (<see cref="ManagedPointer"/> / <see cref="ProgramPointer"/> / <see cref="FunctionPointer"/>) and its STORAGE
/// is 8 character positions; this is the one place that says what those 8 positions hold, for every consumer
/// that must see the bytes rather than the reference — today the CALL boundary's BY CONTENT record (ISO §14.2.3
/// GR9 — "That argument is moved to this allocated record without conversion"; <c>CobolArgAdapt</c>). A pointer
/// MEMBER of a shared storage area keeps its value in the area's managed slot and its positions stay the kb/Work
/// PB231 reserved fill; carrying this image there too is an open lead (the ALLOCATE fill, the group-image
/// composer's seed and the slot store would all ask this codec), not a second codec.
/// <para>THE DETERMINATION (CLAUDE.md rule 1's ISO → GnuCOBOL → IBM/Micro Focus precedence; the standard leaves
/// size and representation to the implementor, §13.18.60.4 GR23/GR24/GR26): GnuCOBOL stores a pointer as the
/// machine address — an unsigned integer in the byte order of the platform's native binary integers, so a
/// pointer passed BY CONTENT to a BINARY-DOUBLE formal reads as its address — and the predefined NULL as the zero
/// address, which is also IBM's and Micro Focus's NULL. This implementation has no machine address to store, so
/// the image is an ADDRESS TOKEN in the same shape, in THIS implementation's binary byte order — big-endian, the
/// order DOC-A.1-205/207 pin for every BINARY and BINARY-DOUBLE item — so the GnuCOBOL property (the image read
/// as an 8-byte binary integer IS the address) holds here too:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>NULL, of every category → eight X"00" positions.</item>
/// <item>A data-pointer into a storage area → the area's BASE plus the pointer's displacement, as a signed 64-bit
/// little-endian integer. Each area is given its base the first time one of its addresses is imaged: the k-th
/// base is k × 2^32, so two areas' images never meet while a displacement stays inside ±2^31, and
/// <c>SET P UP BY n</c> moves the image by exactly n — the address arithmetic GnuCOBOL programs expect.</item>
/// <item>A program-pointer / function-pointer → a base drawn from the SAME allocator, one per (category,
/// case-folded externalized name) — so equal pointers (§8.8.4.2.16) have equal images and no image of one
/// category is ever an image of another.</item>
/// </list>
/// The token is stable for the run unit and never reused; it is not decodable back into a reference, and needs
/// not be — every conforming pairing that delivers a pointer's BYTES to a non-pointer item is a one-way copy
/// (§14.8.2.3.2 forbids the BY REFERENCE pairing; §14.8.2.3.3 1) admits BY CONTENT into a same-length item).
