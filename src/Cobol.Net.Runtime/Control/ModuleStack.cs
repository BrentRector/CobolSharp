/// pushes a frame at every activation boundary (RunMain for the main program; CallProgram for every CALL /
/// cross-assembly CALL / user-function reference / nested-program CALL) and pops it on return, so the top of
/// stack is always the currently running runtime element. Each frame carries the element's own name, the
/// outermost program-id of its compilation unit (§15.65.4 r7 CURRENT), and whether it is a nested (contained)
/// program (r8 NESTED). One INSTANCE per run unit on <see cref="RunUnit"/> (was the runtime's ONE
/// <c>[ThreadStatic]</c> — the ambient run unit's AsyncLocal now carries the activation scope uniformly,
/// DESIGN-runtime-library §2.1).
///
/// OO method (INVOKE) activation does not funnel through CallProgram (methods are not registry nodes), so the
/// push is emitted INSIDE the method body — <c>OoEmitter.EmitMethod</c>, in a try/finally — rather than at any
/// call site: a method is reached by a typed direct call, by the universal <c>__CobolInvoke</c> switch, and by

/// ⛔ THIS COMMENT USED TO SAY THE OMISSION WAS "conformant, not residue: §15.65.4 r3/r4 make the returned form

/// runtime element that is NOT a COBOL runtime element; a COBOL method is one. r4 is about the FORM of the name
/// and explicitly lists "method-id" among the forms an implementor may return — which presumes the element is on
/// the stack. Meanwhile r5 names "an INVOKE statement" as an activation mechanism outright. The cost of the
/// misreading was three wrong answers inside every method: CURRENT returned the CALLER, STACK omitted the method,
/// and ACTIVATING returned the single space r5 reserves for a MAIN PROGRAM.
