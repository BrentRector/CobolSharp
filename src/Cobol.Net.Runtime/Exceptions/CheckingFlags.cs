/// no exception condition is raised").
///
/// <para><b>Why a struct and not loose fields.</b> §14.9.28.4 GR14 requires an exception-checking PERFORM to
/// take "an implicit PUSH ALL followed by TURN OFF ALL … at the end of imperative-statement-1" and an
/// "implicit POP ALL" immediately before END-PERFORM — a WHOLESALE save/clear/restore of every flag at once.
/// Expressed over individual properties that is a hand-maintained list, and the failure mode is silent: an
/// exception condition added later that forgets to join the list simply stops obeying GR14, with no test
/// failing and no diagnostic. Holding the flags in one value makes PUSH ALL a struct copy and TURN OFF ALL a
/// <c>default</c>, so a new condition is covered by construction the moment its field exists here.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Adding a condition</b> is five declarations and no prose: a field HERE, a delegating property on

/// <c>EcEmitter</c>'s gate table, and a ONE-LINE raise helper
/// (<c>… => FatalIfEnabled(&lt;flag&gt;, "&lt;EC&gt;", detail)</c> — kb/Work PB676). Nothing else has to know.
/// <c>ExceptionCheckingFlagsDriftTests</c> fails if an engine flag is ever declared outside this struct, so GR14's
/// PUSH ALL cannot be escaped; <c>ExceptionRaiseHelperDriftTests</c> fails if a helper reads a flag other than the
/// one the emitter pairs to the name it raises, or records a fatality Table 13 does not carry. Both invariants are
