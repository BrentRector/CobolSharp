/// "for the procedure division statements … that follow in the compilation group", so the state is a property of
/// a (source element, line), and §14.6.13.1.1 — "if checking for an exception that occurs is not enabled, no
/// exception condition is raised").
///
/// <para><b>Why a runtime object at all, when <see cref="ExceptionState"/>'s other gates are compile-time.</b>
/// Every ordinary raise site knows its exception-name at COMPILE time, so the binder folds the TURN state there
/// and the emitter simply does not write the guard when checking is off. §14.9.18.4 GR1 b) asks the same question
/// about a name that is NOT known at compile time: a callee's <c>GOBACK … RAISING LAST EXCEPTION</c> decides the
/// name at run time, and the rule localises the raise in the ACTIVATING runtime element — "an exception condition
/// is raised in the activating runtime element if checking for that exception condition is enabled in the
/// activating runtime element". So the ACTIVATING statement has to carry its own per-condition checking state
/// into the run, and this is that carrier. (Before kb/Work PB408 the compiler asked the CALLEE's TURN state at
/// bind time instead, which is a different element's answer.)</para>

/// <para><b>The encoding is the directive stream, not the answer set.</b> A profile is the ordered

/// matching event wins, with §7.3.25.4 GR2/GR3/GR4's hierarchy expansion supplied by

/// instead would mean naming every level-3 name the catalog holds at every activating statement.</para>
///
/// <para>FILE-SCOPED directives (<c>&gt;&gt;TURN EC-I-O … FILE F1</c>) are deliberately absent: GR6 scopes those
