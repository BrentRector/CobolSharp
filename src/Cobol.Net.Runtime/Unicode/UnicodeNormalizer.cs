/// The PUBLIC, stable Unicode normalization surface of COBOL.NET — putting text into one of the two canonical
/// forms (<see cref="UnicodeNormalizationForm.NFD"/>, <see cref="UnicodeNormalizationForm.NFC"/>) so that two
/// spellings of the same characters can be recognized as the same text. See <c>Unicode/README.md</c> for the why.
/// <para><b>NFD is computed by the collation engine's own table-driven decomposition</b>
/// (<c>Collation/Normalizer.cs</c> over <see cref="CollationTable.Root"/>) — there is exactly ONE NFD in this
/// runtime and this class does not add a second. That decomposition reads the canonical decomposition mappings and
/// combining classes baked into the derived collation table, so its answer is the SAME on every host and depends
/// only on the Unicode version the table was generated from (<see cref="NfdUnicodeVersion"/> — 17.0.0), never on
/// the host's ICU. That independence is not theoretical: the development host's bundled ICU predates Unicode 16
/// (<c>Collation/README.md</c> §1/§4).</para>
/// <para><b>NFC is the host's</b> — <see cref="string.Normalize(NormalizationForm)"/> — because composition needs
/// data the derived table does not carry (the composition mappings plus <c>Full_Composition_Exclusion</c>, which
/// NFD never consults). Its Unicode version is therefore the host's, and on a host built with
/// <c>InvariantGlobalization</c> there is no normalizer at all: <see cref="IsNfcAvailable"/> reports that once per
/// process and <see cref="Normalize"/> then returns the text unchanged rather than throwing. This asymmetry is
/// acceptable because NOTHING in the compiler or the runtime needs NFC to be correct — collation, sort keys,
/// indexed-file keys and canonical equivalence are all decided in NFD by the table's own data; NFC is offered for
/// callers that must hand text to the outside world in its composed spelling. <b>Upgrade path:</b> teach
/// <c>scripts/collation/generate-collation-table.py</c> to emit the canonical composition pairs and the
/// <c>Full_Composition_Exclusion</c> set into <c>root-collation.bin</c>; NFC then becomes table-driven and
/// host-independent too, and <see cref="IsNfcAvailable"/> becomes permanently true.</para>

/// <see cref="Lazy{T}"/>).</para>
