/// ⛔ THE EXTENT TABLE OF ONE VARIABLE-LENGTH RECORD — where each of its variable-length components ended when the
/// record was sent (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §3 determination D-FRA (v); kb/Work PB1053).
/// <para>A WRITE / REWRITE / RELEASE sends a variable-length group record as its contiguous image (ISO
/// §8.5.1.11.2), and that image carries no marker of where a dynamic member ends: with two or more variable-length
/// components no split of the characters alone can recover the record the program wrote (<c>"AA" "KEY" "CCCC"</c>
/// and <c>"AAKEY" "CCC" "C"</c> are the same characters). The table is the implementor information §9.1.7.2 admits
/// "on the physical storage medium" beside the record — it travels with the record through every file
/// organization that frames its records and through the sort store, and §12.4.5.11.4 GR1 keeps it out of the
/// record area and the record size: the RECORD is still exactly the contiguous image.</para>
/// <para>Component <c>k</c> is described by <see cref="FixedAt"/>[k] — its offset in the record's FIXED run, the
/// §8.5.1.12.3 zero-length accounting — and <see cref="Lengths"/>[k], its current length in characters.
/// <see cref="CobolContiguousLayout.Decompose(string, RecordExtents?)"/> honours the table only for a receiving
/// record whose components CORRESPOND to it (§8.5.1.12.2 — "Two dynamic-length elementary items correspond if they
/// start at the same relative byte positions within their groups"), and only when it describes the very
/// characters received; any other record is split by the D-FRA take step.</para>
