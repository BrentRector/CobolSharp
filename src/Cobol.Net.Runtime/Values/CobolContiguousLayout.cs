/// ⛔ THE ONE LAYOUT OF A VARIABLE-LENGTH RECORD'S CONTIGUOUS IMAGE (docs/CONFORMANCE.md §3 determinations D-FRA
/// and D-KWV; kb/Work PB981, PB1025). A WRITE / RELEASE sends a variable-length record "as though it were in fact
/// contiguous with its neighbors" (ISO §8.5.1.11.2), so a record read back — or a record held in a sort store or
/// an indexed file — carries no marker of where a dynamic member ends. This object is that record type's
/// component layout, emitted ONCE per record type beside its <c>FromContiguousImage</c>, and it answers the two
/// questions every reader of such an image asks:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><see cref="Decompose"/> — the whole record back into its carrier (the READ / RETURN half);</item>
/// <item><see cref="Position"/> — where a FIXED member (a SORT/MERGE key, an indexed RECORD KEY) sits in THIS
/// record, which varies from record to record when a dynamic member precedes it.</item>
/// </list>
/// Both answers read the SAME two sources, so they agree by construction and a key is found exactly where the
/// decomposition puts it: the record's own EXTENT TABLE (<see cref="RecordExtents"/>, determination D-FRA (v);
/// kb/Work PB1053) when it travelled with the record and describes it — every layout then round-trips, whatever
/// number of variable-length members sit on either side of a fixed one — and otherwise the ONE take step: walking
/// the components left to right, each takes as many whole units (one character of a dynamic-length item, one
/// element of a dynamic-capacity table) as the record holds beyond the FIXED material still to come, up to its
/// maximum.
/// </summary>
